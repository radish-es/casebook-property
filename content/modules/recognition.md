What kinds of relationships with the land are afforded legal recognition? Legal recognition both reflects and structures relationships to land. The forms of recognition have important consequences for what happens on land and signal which relationships are intrinsically valued (and which are not). 

Common law lawyers speak about "property" not as a "thing" but as a particular relationship between legal persons with respect to land or chattels--a relationship *in rem*.<!--CONCEPT-->

- But this is just one of many possible ways of understanding relationships to land.<!--treaty as recognition-->

- How do relationships between people with respect to land get recognized in the common law tradition?<!--possession; title-->

- What consequences and values are associated with these forms of recognition (including colonial land relations)? 

- How does these forms of common law recognition compare to those reflected in and structured by Indigenous legal orders?

### Paths

- First possession as recognition 
- Denial of recognition to Indigenous peoples, ANS communities 

- How/why is first possession the basis of recognition? (Locke, Clift, then St. Catherines as denial of title based on possession, reserves, terra nullius, ANS migration, adverse possession as a trump to title)
- How is recognition based on possession and title relative? (Asher, finders?) 
- How can possession be abandoned (finders, Clift)? 
- How is the problem of recognition an example of the liberal dilemma and how does the classical style attempt to resolve?
- Treaty as recognition (within Indigenous communities; between Indigenous and settler communities)
