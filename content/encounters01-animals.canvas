As the Peace and Friendship Treaties illustrate, the process of state formation as an inter-cultural collision between nations is often ambigous and uncertain--and that is just the point.\n\nThis same idea about the role of \"ambiguity\" can be carried over into the doctrine of possession at common law. While at first glace the idea of dominion seems like a \"crystal\", the doctrine is more often in the \"mud\" which leaves it flexible, adaptive, and peace-making\n\nThis also track's MacKay's idea of state formation as \"passive revolution\"","x":2158,"y":960,"width":560,"height":368},
