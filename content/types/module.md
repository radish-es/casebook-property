# MODULE? = a curated collection of other components (cases, problems, concepts, etc) combined with commentary
class: # the content type; here = module
title: # title of the module
short: # a short version of the title, if needed (to appear in links, side-bar, etc)
description: # a brief description of the module
img: # a header image
# QUESTION: should modules have tags, or are these best left to the different components? 
# QUESTION (Gavin): Would it make sense to include the commentary that relates to modules as a seperate type in addition to storing them with the modules? I suppose it may depend on how tied they are to the rest of the context of the module, but could help organization (and the commentary rather than the module as a whole could then be tagged).
tags: # key related concepts, doctrines, themes
