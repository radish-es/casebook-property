### Hypothetical Facts

Suppose that a testator (the legal term for a person making a will, which is also called a "testamentary bequest") owns a farm in New Brunswick that has been in their family for several generations. The testator has a daughter who has always wanted to be a farmer and the testator has told several of their friends that they are keen to support this dream. But having recently attended a public lecture about the *Land Back* movement--an Indigenous-led movement advocating for the return of Indigenous lands to Indigenous peoples--and having followed the progress of the Wolastoqey and Mi’gmawe’l Tplu’taqnn Inc. claims for recognition and affirmation of Aboriginal Title through the news, the testator has developed an avid interest--if somewhat limited understanding--around land justice in this context. The testator asks their lawyer to include the following provision in their will:

> When I die, the farm should go to my daughter. When she can no longer make use of the land, it should go to Mi’gmawe’l Tplu’taqnn Inc. (MTI), which non-profit organization should be prohibited from transferring the land to any other party for a period of 50 years, after which said organization may only transfer it to another Mi'kmaq-led entity for no more than an amount of $500,000. It is my hope that by this Last Will & Testament the Mi'kmaq might regain control of the land and recognition of their Aboriginal Title over some small tract of their traditional territory.

### The Problem

**When the testator passes away, what interests in the farmland would likely be created through this provision in the will? Be sure to identify and address any problems with interpreting the will. Do you think the testator's aim to return "control" and "recognize Aboriginal Title" via a testamentary bequest is consistent with the concept of Aboriginal Title as you currently understand it? Is it consistent with the aims of the Land Back movement as described by the Yellowhead Institute?**
