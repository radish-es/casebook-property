This week, as we continue to study basic patterns of common law argument, we will look at the issue of whether or not individuals can or should hold legally-recognized property rights in their biological cells. Various legal rules, from criminal law statutes to tort principles, aim to protect a person's bodily integrity from harm or intrusion. But in some circumstances, a person's biological cells might be removed or become detached from their body. Once those cells are separated from the body of a living person, this opens up the possibility that the law might regard them as the subject of property. 

We will start to explore a legal analysis of this issue using the *Moore v Regents of the University of California* case, below. But before we get there, consider the following question from a more everyday or informal perspective:

> *Should a person continue to have ownership of their biological cells once those cells are removed or detached from their body?*

Please listen to the *Radiolab* podcast below as you think about how you would answer this question and the *arguments* you would use to support your conclusion. You may also want to think about how you would define "ownership" in this particular context of biological cells.

Write down your answer and bring it to class.

We will discuss your answers when we meet this week. Keep your own arguments in mind when you read the *Moore* case and ask yourself: Did any of your arguments overlap with those of the judges in the case? If they were different, how so?
