We have seen this week and last how judges in the style of classical common law thought largely foreclosed any genuine consideration of Indigenous laws or of a multi-juridical Canada. Later in the course, we will return to this idea and ask about possibilities for intersections between legal orders. 

As you start to think about this question, consider the work and music of Wolastoqiyik artist Jeremy Dutcher, a member of the Tobique First Nation (Neqotkuk) who released his Juno and Polaris prize-winning album *Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa* in 2018. Dutcher, who trained as an operatic tenor at Dalhousie, recorded the album entirely in Wolastoqey as part of a project that brings the artist into a kind of musical dialogue with ancestral voices from his community singing traditional songs that were recorded by the anthropologist William Mechling on wax cylinders between 1907 and 1914.[^macdonald2018]

Are there lessons here for lawyers and others pursuing new ways to think about and shape Canada as a multi-juridical country?
