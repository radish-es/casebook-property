Last week, we identified [three questions of legal style](../week4/#three-questions-of-common-law-style) that can help us to distinguish the classical style of common law thought from those that came after. We then read Locke's treatise and *Clift and Kane* using those questions to describe how the classical style tends to privilege *competition* over *control*, to draw a sharp distinction between the public and private spheres, and to adopt a *formalist* rather than *functionalist* approach to legal reasoning. 

Which if any of these features of the classical style can you identify in the different decisions in the *St. Catherine's Milling* case? From the perspective of readers at the time, how do you think these features helped to determine which judicial interpretations of Aboriginal title were most persuasive?
