Students are protesting on the Quad. The University brings a claim in trespass under the *Protection of Property Act*. Can the protestors defend against the claim?

- Some fact about "control" (on the Quad vs inside Henry Hicks)

- Is the land public or private?[^1]
If private: 
- Is the university in sufficient possession of the land? 
- What interests are at stake? 

The key point of this week's problem is to get the students to practice the problem-based hypertext (PBH) method. The motivating question is: Where do you start? Want the students to see that they will get different answers / focus on the quesiton of "what is the issue?" depending on where they start (.e.g "possession" via PPA, "possession"/"intersts at stake" via Harrison, public/private via commonwealth)
