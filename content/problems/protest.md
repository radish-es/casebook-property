## Hypothetical Facts

Suppose that Dalhousie University wants to bring a claim against a group of student and local-resident protesters under the *Protection of Property Act*, RSNS 1989, c 363. The protesters are part of the "Divest Dalhousie" movement that is pressuring the University to divest its endowment portfolio of all  assets in the fossil fuel and arms manufacturing sectors. The ongoing protest, which has been mostly peaceful and carried out in sunny weather, is taking place on the main quad and inside one of the administration buildings. 

## The Problem

**What questions, raised by these facts, need to be answered to figure out whether the University's claim will be successful?**

## Analyzing the Problem: Issue Spotting

Notice that this week's problem does not ask you to determine whether or not Dalhousie will actually be successful in its claim against the protestors. The problem instead asks you to identify the questions that you will need to answer along the way. We sometimes refer to this practice of identifying the right questions to ask as "spotting the legal issues". 

After reading this week's problem any number of questions might come to your mind. The trick with issue spotting is to identify and articulate the questions that have *legal relevance*. For example, a question that does *not* have any legal relevance in this context is: *What was the weather like during the protest?* 

But how do you know whether a question is legally relevant or not? This is where the cases and the statute you will read this week come in. These materials frame and define the legal issues you are trying to spot. Your task is to read the materials with an eye toward finding the relevant issues and describing them in terms of our problem's facts.

#### Have a look

As you mull over this problem, consider going for a walk or ride through the quad. Does anything about the physical space affect the way you approach your analysis?

In line with the *problem-based learning approach* described in the lesson, your next step is to select one of this week's readings as a starting point and then choose a pathway through the readings to address the problem. As you do this, keep track of the order in which you read the materials and think about how this might affect your analysis of the problem.
