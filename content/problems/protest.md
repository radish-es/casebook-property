## Facts

Suppose that Dalhousie University wants to bring a claim against a group of student and local-resident protesters under the *Protection of Property Act*, RSNS 1989, c 363. The protesters are part of the "Divest Dalhousie" movement that is pressuring the University to divest its endowment portfolio of all  assets in the fossil fuel and arms manufacturing sectors. The ongoing protest, which has been mostly peaceful and carried out in sunny weather, is taking place on the University Quad and inside one of the main administration buildings. 

## Problem

**What questions do these facts raise that you think will need to be answered in order to determine whether the University is successful in its claim?**

## Analyzing the Problem

Notice that this week's problem does not ask you to figure out whether or not Dalhousie will actually be successful in its claim against the protestors. The problem instead asks you to identify the questions that you will likely need to answer along the way. We sometimes refer to this practice of identifying the right questions to ask as "legal issue spotting". 

After reading this week's problem any number of questions might come to your mind. The trick with legal issue spotting is to identify and articulate the questions that have *legal relevance*. For example, a question that does *not* have any legal relevance in this context is: *What was the weather like during the protest?* 

But how do you know when a question is legally relevant or not? This is where the cases and the statute you will read this week come in. These materials frame the legal issues you are trying to spot. Your task is to read the materials with an eye toward finding the relevant issues and describing them in terms of our problem's facts.

In line with the *problem-based hypertext learning approach* described in the lesson, your next step is to select one of this week's readings as a starting point to address the problem.
