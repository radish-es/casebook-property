East Eggleston is a small, coastal residential community in rural Nova Scotia made infamous by a short-lived but very public protest outside its gates.

The land in East Eggleston has a long history and involves a complicated web of legal relationships. East Eggleston itself was created in the early 1970s by a group of people worried about the rising cost of housing in their region. The group incorporated a small [co-operative organization](https://canada.coop/en/what-is-a-co-op/#) and raised enough money to purchase the twenty-five hectares on which East Eggleston now stands from a real estate developer then facing insolvency. The co-operative went on to develop housing on the land and sold off individual plots at below-market prices to individual purchasers but retained ownership of the infrastructure (roads, water and sewer, parks, etc), which it continues own and operate for the benefit of the residents. The co-op's Board and its membership are comprised entirely of community residents.

Over time, as housing prices in the province continued to rise--especially in the city--demand for the comparatively affordable plots in East Eggleston skyrocketed. Wealthier individuals started to move in and build larger, pricier houses. Using their growing influence among the co-op's membership, they also began to push for other community amenities (like a shared pool). A few years ago, the co-op voted to install a large wrought-iron gate about half-way up the private road leading into the community from the public highway, making the remainder of the road accessible only to residents and others with a pass card. The community also posted a sign reading "Private Property: No Entry Except by Residents or With Permission".

The protest directly outside of East Eggleston's gate started the day after a news story was published about an individual from Halifax who offered to purchase a house for sale in the community but was refused, without reason, by the seller. The media story explained that the prospective purchaser, who is Black, offered well above asking and had learned that there were no competing offers on the house. East Eggleston's current residents are predominantly white. 

As public attention to the incident grew, the reporter of the original story discovered that the insolvent real estate developer--who sold East Eggleston's co-op the land back in the 70s--had first purchased it from the Catholic Church for a huge sum, planning to build a luxury seaside resort. Once these facts were uncovered, the original protestors were joined by activists speaking to the [need for reparations](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-catholic-church-canadian-assets-investigation/) addressing the historical and ongoing harms connected to residential schools and to the broader pursuit of land justice in Mi'kma'ki. Others used the gated community of East Eggleston to underscore the [crisis of affordable housing](https://monitormag.ca/articles/filling-data-gaps-in-the-nova-scotia-housing-crisis/) in the province and the inability for unhoused people to meet their basic needs on a daily basis. Some of East Eggleston's earliest and longest residents, worried about the direction their community had taken lately, also joined in.

After a few days of these protests, the co-op's Board demanded that the protestors move their activities to the nearby public highway, making it effectively impossible for the activists to sustain their action. When the protestors refused to move, the Board decided to pursue convictions for trespass under the *Protection of Property Act*.
