### Hypothetical Facts

Suppose that a Mi'kmaw hunter pursues a fox (*wowkwis*, in Mi'kmaq) across a large tract of forest on the Eastern Shore of Mi'kmaki (Nova Scotia). After several hours, the hunter shoots and seriously wounds the *wowkiws* on Fox Island Main Beach, land designated as provincial Crown Land <!--(i.e. land "vested in the Crown" and "under the administration and control of the Minister" of Lands and Forests pursuant to the-->under the *Crown Lands Act*, RSNS 1989, c 114, s 9 and as a "beach" under the *Beaches Act*, RSNS 1989, c 32. Before the hunter can capture the *wowkwis* as it runs along the foreshore, the fox is attacked and killed by a large dog that is walking--off leash--with its owner--an elderly white man--along the sand. Seeing the commotion, a patrolling RCMP officer approaches the hunter and asks them to produce a hunting license as required by the *Wildlife Act*, RSNS 1989, c 504.

### The Problem

**Can the hunter prevent the RCMP officer from taking the pelt of the *wowkwis*? Are any of the legal arguments available to the hunter more likely than others to succeed? Why or why not?**

### Analyzing the Problem

What are the possible legal relationships between the hunter and the fox in this scenario and on what legal source(s) does each relationship depend? Is it likely that these relationships are equally recognized and enforced? Why or why not?
