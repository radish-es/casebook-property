### Hypothetical Facts

Suppose that a Mi'kmaw hunter pursues a fox (*wowkwis*, in Mi'kmaq) across a large tract of forest on the Eastern Shore of Mi'kmaki (Nova Scotia). After several hours, the hunter shoots and seriously wounds the *wowkiws* on Fox Island Main Beach, land designated as provincial Crown Land <!--(i.e. land "vested in the Crown" and "under the administration and control of the Minister" of Lands and Forests pursuant to the-->under the *Crown Lands Act*, RSNS 1989, c 114, s 9 and as a "beach" under the *Beaches Act*, RSNS 1989, c 32. Before the hunter can capture the *wowkwis* as it runs along the foreshore, the fox is attacked and killed by a dog that is walking along the sand off leash with its owner, who is white. Seeing the commotion, a patrolling conservation officer approaches the hunter and asks them to produce a hunting license as required by the *Wildlife Act*, RSNS 1989, c 504. 

### The Problem

**The hunter has a a Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq Harvester Identification Card issued by the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaw Chiefs but no hunting licence. The dog owner happens to be carrying a licence and claims exclusive property in the fox. Is the dog owner correct? Are some legal arguments in this context likely to be more powerful or persuasive than others?**

### Analyzing the Problem

On its face, this problem raises a classic question in Anglo-Canadian property law: who owns the fox? In order to answer this question, we need to know how ownership is established. Where does this basic ownership relation in property come from and what does it entail?

Once we dig a bit deeper, however, an even more fundamental question starts to emerge. Is property the *only* relevant legal relationship in this scenario? How does our analysis change once we consider principles and perspectives about land, animals, governance and sovereignty from treaties and from Mi'kmaw law? Is it possible to fit these principles and perspectives together, accounting for the power dynamics inherent in colonial land relations?
