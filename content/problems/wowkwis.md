    explanation: Today, unlike in 1928, the Mi'kmaw hunter's treaty rights to hunt are well-recognized by the courts. But what does the Syliboy case tell us about how the question of who 'owns' the fox might be resolved?

    explanation: Starting from the premise that a wild animal is "unowned", what would Locke say is the basis for the hunter's claim that the fox is their property?

    explanation: What does the common law require the hunter to do to establish possession in the wowkwis? Do the judges in this case agree on the answer to this question?

    explanation: There is more than one claim to property in the fox in our problem. How can the reasoning in this case help us to determine who has the better claim?

West Eggleston is back in the news after the surprising events surrounding a fox hunt. 

The controversy arose from fairly routine events, as a Mik'maw hunter pursued a fox (*wowkwis*, in Mi'kmaq) during a morning hunt across a large tract of inland forest neighbouring several residential parcels in and around West Egg. The forestland is designated by the Province of Nova Scotia as Crown Land. 

After several hours of pursuit, the hunter shot and wounded the wowkwis but was unable to capture it before it ran toward one of the neighbouring properties on which there was a small house and backyard surrounded by a fence. Upon hearing the clamour the occupant of the house emerged and spotted the wounded wowkwis scratching at the gate in the fence. Quickly assessing the scene, and being a long-time animal rights activist who opposed hunting, the house's occupant opened the gate and ushered the fox inside. Despite the best efforts to save it, the fox died soon afterward.

The hunter requested that the fox pelt be returned to them, but the house's occupant refused. In the aftermath of the dispute, it was discovered that the occupant was not in fact the owner of the land where the fox died. By some mistake the land had been sold by the West Egg co-operative as part of the initial settlement, but the parcel was never included in the co-operative's original. Rather the land was part of the larger tract of neighbouring Crown Land.

By-laws of West Egg say no keeping of wild or domestical animals.
