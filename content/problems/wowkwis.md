    explanation: Today, unlike in 1928, the Mi'kmaw hunter's treaty rights to hunt are well-recognized by the constitution and the courts. But what does the Syliboy case tell us about how the question of who 'owns' the fox might be resolved?
  - url: content/statutes/wildlife.md
    explanation: Does this statute determine ownership of the fox? If not, what work is it doing in these circumstances?
  - url: content/secondary/locke.md
    explanation: Starting from the premise that a wild animal is "unowned", what would Locke say is the basis for the hunter's claim that the fox is their property?
  - url: content/concepts/netukulimk.md
    explanation: How might this principle of Mi'kmaw law be applied to address the legal dispute here? Would it simply allocate "ownership" in a different way? 
  - url: content/cases/clift.md
    explanation: What does the common law require the hunter to do to establish possession in the fox? How do the judges in this case disagree on the answer?

A Mi'kmaw hunter pursued a fox (*wowkwis*, in Mi'kmaq) during a long morning hunt across a large tract forest land on the Eastern Shore of Mi'kmaki (Nova Scotia) called *Sebelogwokun* ("where skins are stretched"). After several hours, the hunter eventually shot and mortally wounded the *wowkiws* within the boundaries of Fox Island Main Beach, which is provincial Crown Land (i.e. land "vested in the Crown" and "under the administration and control of the Minister" of Lands and Forests pursuant to the *Crown Lands Act*, RSNS 1989, c 114, s 9) and designed under the provincial *Beaches Act*, RSNS 1989, c 32. 

Before the hunter could kill and capture the *wowkwis*, the animal was intercepted by an RCMP officer patrolling the beach, who placed it in a cage, where it soon succumbed to its injuries. Approaching the hunter, the officer demanded to see their hunting licence obtained under the *Wildlife Act*, RSNS 1989, c 504. The hunter replied that they carried no such license and was hunting pursuant to their constitutionally-protected treaty rights. 

**What is the legal relationship between the hunter and the *wowkwis*?**
