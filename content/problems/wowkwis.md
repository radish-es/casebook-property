    explanation: Today, unlike in 1928, the Mi'kmaw hunter's treaty rights to hunt are well-recognized by the constitution and the courts. But what does the Syliboy case tell us about how the question of who 'owns' the fox might be resolved?
  - url: content/statutes/wildlife.md
    explanation: Does this statute determine ownership of the fox? If not, what work is it doing in these circumstances?
  - url: content/secondary/locke.md
    explanation: Starting from the premise that a wild animal is "unowned", what would Locke say is the basis for the hunter's claim that the fox is their property?
  - url: content/concepts/netukulimk.md
    explanation: How might this principle of Mi'kmaw law be applied to address the legal dispute here? Would it simply allocate "ownership" in a different way? 
  - url: content/cases/clift.md
    explanation: What does the common law require the hunter to do to establish possession in the fox? How do the judges in this case disagree on the answer?

A Mi'kmaw hunter pursued a fox (*wowkwis*, in Mi'kmaq) during a long morning hunt across a large tract of forest on the Eastern Shore of Mi'kmaki (Nova Scotia) called *Sebelogwokun* ("where skins are stretched"). After several hours, the hunter eventually shot and seriously wounded the *wowkiws* within the boundaries of Fox Island Main Beach, land designated as  provincial Crown Land <!--(i.e. land "vested in the Crown" and "under the administration and control of the Minister" of Lands and Forests pursuant to the-->under the *Crown Lands Act*, RSNS 1989, c 114, s 9 and as a "beach" under the *Beaches Act*, RSNS 1989, c 32. 

Before the hunter could kill and capture the *wowkwis* as it ran along the foreshore, the fox was suddenly chased back into the woods by a surprised golden retriever that had been walking--off leash--with its owner along the sand. As the hunter prepared to give chase they were intercepted by an RCMP officer patrolling the beach. The officer demanded that the hunter produce a valid hunting license as required by the *Wildlife Act*, RSNS 1989, c 504. The hunter replied that they held no such license and were hunting pursuant to their constitutionally-protected treaty rights. 

**What are the relevant legal relationships in this story? On what sources of law are those relationships based?**

- Common law possession and ownership, including relative claims, as between hunter and officer (Locke, Pierson, Armourie)
- Statutory ownership under the Wildlife Act
- Treaty relationship between the hunter and the officer
- Mi'kmaw law according the Netukulimk
- Discrimination in application of the law (dog walker under the beaches act vs hunting license under the Wildlife Act)
