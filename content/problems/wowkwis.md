#### Writing and speaking about Indigenous Peoples in legal contexts

Kelti McGloin, a JD student at the Schulich School of Law, and Professor Naiomi Metallic have created an excellent guide called *[Best Practices for Writing About Indigenous Peoples in the Canadian Legal Context](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5cc99defc10ef100015cd06d/t/666ae57fc4cffd197160d82f/1718281600059/StyleGuide_June2024.pdf)*. You can use this guide as a reference throughout the year if you have questions about terminology to use in class or in your written work.

### Hypothetical Facts

Suppose that the [Maw-lukutijik Saqmaq](https://mikmaqrights.com/#ansmc) (Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaw Chiefs) has recently issued a statement underlining the significant role that Mi'kmaq harvesters play in establishing and sustaining healthy forest ecosystems.

A Mi'kmaw hunter pursues a fox (*wowkwis*, in Mi'kmaq) across a large tract of forest on the Eastern Shore of Mi'kmaki designated by Nova Scotia as provincial Crown Land (i.e. land "vested in the Crown" and "under the administration and control of the Minister" of Lands and Forests pursuant to the *Crown Lands Act*, RSNS 1989, c 114, s 9). After several hours, the hunter shoots and seriously wounds the *wowkiws*. Before the hunter can capture it, the fox is attacked and killed by a dog that is walking off leash with its owner, a white settler who lives nearby. Seeing the commotion, a patrolling conservation officer approaches the hunter and asks them to produce a hunting license as required by the *Wildlife Act*, RSNS 1989, c 504. 

### The Problem

**The hunter has a a Nova Scotia Mi'kmaq Harvester Identification Card issued by the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi'kmaw Chiefs but no hunting licence. The dog owner happens to be carrying a licence and claims exclusive property in the fox. Is the dog owner correct? Why or why not?**

### Analyzing the Problem

On its face, this problem raises a classic question in Anglo-Canadian property law: who owns a wild animal? In order to answer this question, we need to know *how* ownership is established. Where does this basic ownership relation in property come from and what does it entail?

Once we dig a bit deeper, an even more fundamental question starts to emerge. Is property the *only* relevant legal relationship in this scenario? How does our analysis change once we consider principles and perspectives about land, animals, governance and sovereignty from the treaties and from Mi'kmaw law? As you work through this problem, consider whether some legal arguments in this context are likely to be more "persuasive" than others, and to whom. 

<!--Consider the following prompts 

- How are the rules of property different between domestic and wild animals?
- What are at least two different ways that someone can establish ownership in a wild animal under Anglo-Canadian law?
- Do the readings agree on how the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1752 should be interpreted and understood? -->

<!--
- possession as the basis of property and the relative nature of possession
- the state as the basis of property (Wildlife Act)
- treaty as the basis of land relations in an inter-social context
- Mi'kmaw law
