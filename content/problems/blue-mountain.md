Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Lakes is a stunning wilderness area located minutes from downtown Halifax. Attempts by the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) to prevent development on private lands next to the wilderness area have made landowners unhappy. 

Blue Mountain-Birch Cove was designated as a provincially-protected wilderness area in 2009. It started as 1,316 hectares of Crown land and was later expanded, in 2015, to 1,767 hectares. Several private landowners own undeveloped lands adjacent to the protected area. One of those landowners is the Annapolis Group Inc. (Annapolis), whose undeveloped lands have remained essentially wilderness since Annapolis began to acquire them sometime in the middle of the last century.

In 2006, the HRM Council passed a Regional Municipal Planning Strategy (MPS) to guide future land development in the regional municipality for the next 25 years. In effect, the MPS lays out a vision for future land development across the region based on broad public consultation but does not commit the municipality to undertake any specific actions pursuant to the plan. 

The 2006 Regional MPS designated a portion of Annapolis' lands for possible future serviced development (such as a low-density residential subdivision) and a portion for a possible future regional park. 

At the same time as the HRM Council passed the Regional MPS, it also passed the Halifax Mainland Land Use By-Law, which establishes and assigns the necessary land-use zones needed to implement the MPS designations. Under the zoning by-law, no development can occur on the Annapolis lands unless the HRM Council passes a resolution authorizing a secondary planning process and subsequent zoning amendment. 

In 2007, Annapolis requested that HRM Council initiate such a secondary planning process. But after widespread public backlash against Annapolis' development plans (which included a proposal to shrink the proposed park to accommodate a larger subdivision development), Council instead passed a resolution in 2016 refusing to proceed with further planning and zoning changes to the Annapolis lands. As a result, the current zoning by-law continues to prohibit any development on those lands.

In 2017, Annapolis filed a Notice of Action and Statement of Claim alleging that HRM had *de facto* expropriated its lands for public use as a park. As part of this claim, Annapolis alleges that HRM encouraged members of the public to hike, cycle, canoe, camp and swim on its lands (along with the protected lands within the Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Wilderness Area) and financially supported organizations making similar encouragements.

Annapolis claims compensation for the *de facto* expropriation under Nova Scotia's *Expropriation Act*, which provides that every person whose land is expropriated by a public authority shall be paid reasonable compensation. The *Expropriation Act* defines "expropriation" as a "taking of land" but does not further define what amounts to such a taking. 

Based on the facts above, is the Court likely to find that HRM has *de facto* expropriated Annapolis' land, thereby ordering the municipality to pay compensation? We will try to come up with an initial answer to this question based on the materials studied this week.
