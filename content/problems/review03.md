title: Mid-Term Rapid Review
short: Rapid Review
class: problem
description:  A series of rapid review questions to assess your knowledge and understanding at the end term.
summary: We will use our time in class to do a help identify key gaps in your knowledge and understanding in the course this term, with an emphasis on the weeks since our last review. To that end, I have provided a list of "rapid review" questions for you to read and consider. I donâ€™t suggest that you address them all in full detail. Instead, read each and consider your answer for no more than a minute or two. You can come back to these questions in more detail as part of your exam preparation--their purpose at this point is only to provide a check on what you've learned so far and to help you to discover where you can most effectively focus your studying.

## Week 10: Constructive Takings and Acquired Rights

- What is the legal test for *de facto* expropriation in Canadian law? 

- Why is the concept of "reasonable use of the land" important for determining if a *de facto* expropriation has taken place? How do we know what the "reasonable use of land" is? 

- How do we know when a "beneficial interest in land" is acquired by government? Can you give an example? (How) is this different from the acquisition of an "advantage" by the state?

- Is the loss or gain of land value irrelevant to the analysis of *de facto* expropriation? Why or why not?

- What is the relationship between the growing use of planning and zoning regimes by municipal authorities and the acquired rights established by common law courts? 

- If the operation of a bicycle repair shop was permitted on land last year, but the zoning was changed to exclude bicycle repair shops last month, does the landowner retain the right to operate a garage on their land? What about a busy gas station? 

- What is the source of an acquired right? Why does this matter?

- What is the legal test for determining the scope of an acquired right? 

## Week 11: Right to Shelter

- There are 175 available shelter beds in a city; according to the local government's best estimate, there are no more than 150 homeless persons living in the city. Do those experiencing homelessness have a right to shelter in public parks? On city sports fields or on the city's busy waterfront boardwalk? 

- What would it mean to have a right to *adequate* shelter? How, if at all, is "adequacy" related to the choices or preferences of those in need of shelter?

- In what way is a time-limited right to shelter in public parks between 7PM and 9AM similar to or different from a municipal bylaw prohibiting "panhandling" in some downtown areas but permitting it in others? 

- Is it appropriate to frame/understand the right the shelter under section 7 of the *Charter* as a conflict between the needs of unhoused persons and the interests of the general public in accessing safe and orderly public spaces? Between the needs of unhoused persons and the responsibility of local governments to maintain these spaces?

## Week 12: Restrictive Covenants and Qualified Interests

- Are restrictive covenants contracts or incidents of property? 

- What legal requirements does a restrictive covenant need to meet in order to "run with the servient land"? 

- Is a restrictive covenant requiring that agricultural crops grown on the land be cultivated organically one that is negative in nature? What about a covenant requiring upkeep of a hedgerow? 

- Would a restrictive covenant prohibiting sale of agricultural land to certain named corporations "touch and concern" the land? Would it be otherwise enforceable? 

- What are the legal requirements that must be met in order for a court to apply the public policy doctrine to invalidate a restrictive covenant?

- In what sense are possessory and future interests (i.e. property "vested in interest") both "present interests"? 

- Classify the property interests created in the following devise in trust: "to A for life, then to B for life, then to C if they graduate high school." What is the potential problem with this devise? How might that problem be avoided? 

- How did the courts in *Re Drummond Wren* and *Noble v Alley* differ in their approach to striking down the racially restrictive covenants in each case? Does this difference matter, and if so why? 

- Can the public policy doctrine ever apply to a private bequest? 

- What is the legal relevance of the recitals contained in the trust document in *Canada Trust Co v Ontario*? 

- Why is it significant that the bequest in *McCorkill* is vested rather than contingent? 

## Course themes

- Give one or more examples of each of the following judicial moves from the materials studied so far this term:

    1. The individual freedoms of property owners and free competition between those interests recedes to the background; public power and demands for social control are drawn into the foreground.

    2. The relevance of legal distinctions between private and public interests is explicitly or implicitly contested (or rejected entirely).
    
    3. Social consequences of the decision become a primary consideration; formalist reliance on settled principles is diminished.

- Please read the excerpt from *[Oliver Wendell Holmes, "The Path of Law"]({{< ref "secondary/holmes" >}})*. What is Justice Holmes saying in this article? How might his approach be understood as laying the basis for the "modern" style of Anglo-Canadian legal thought?
