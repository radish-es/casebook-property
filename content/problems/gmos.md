### Hypothetical Facts

A farmer grows heritage sweet corn on a small acreage. They market the corn as GMO-free and sell it at a local farmers market at a premium price (around $1/ear more than other varieties). Each year, the farmer carefully cultivates, collects and stores seed from a portion of their crop to plant the following season. 

One of the neighboring farm properties has recently been purchased from a retiring farmer named Hatfield by the nearby agricultural college to use as an experimental site for developing new corn varieties. Some of those new varieties are Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) designed for features such as disease resistance. Over the years, research into GMO corn and other crops has become a lucrative source of income for the college--especially in those instances where it has acquired patent rights to the exclusive reproduction and use of the varieties it has developed. The college plans to employ over fifty people from the surrounding community in various roles at its new experimental site. 

Several years ago, Hatfield entered into an agreement with McCoy (from whom the heritage corn farmer had purchased their land), promising that they, Hatfield, would only engage in "sustainable" farming methods on the land defined as, among other things, excluding the planting or production of GMO crops. When the agricultural college was negotiating to purchase the land, Hatfield had mentioned in passing that there were some "sustainability constraints" around using the land but did not elaborate. 

### The Problem

**The heritage farmer is worried about "genetic drift" from GMO varieties grown on the college lands contaminating their corn crop through cross-pollination. What legal claims, if any, might the farmer make against the agricultural college to prevent it from growing GMO corn on its land and what are the chances that those claims will succeed? For the purposes of this question, you can assume proof of a nuisance having been caused by the college.**

### Developing Your Answer

This week we return to practicing the skills of issue spotting and legal analysis of a hypothetical fact pattern. From the list below, you are encouraged to start your readings with either *Shelfer v City of London*, which deals with the tort of nuisance, or *Keppell v Bailey*, which deals with the topic of  covenants on title to land.
