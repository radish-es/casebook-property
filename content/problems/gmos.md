One of West Eggleston's more locally-famous residents grows exceptional, bright yellow heirloom tomatoes on a half-acre plot in the community, which they sell at a large mark-up at the old Brewery Market in Halifax every weekend. The success of the tomato plants is sustained through careful collection, storage, and planting of the seeds from the previous year's crop to ensure that each tomato is a true (and delicious) reflection of its long heritage. 

Recently, the new owner of one of the several farms neighbouring West Egg decided to invest in large-scale greenhouse tomato production. To develop and market a product novel to Nova Scotians, the new farmer decided to license the only available genetically-modified (GMO) tomato currently available, from US-based company called Norfolk Plant Sciences--a tomato with rich purple fruit that is especially high in antioxidants. Under the terms of the license, they pay a significant annual fee to Norkfolk--who retains patent rights--to use their tomato seed and are specifically prohibited from saving and replanting seeds the following season or otherwise reproducing the tomato plants in any way. 

This growing season, the West Egg resident began to notice that when their prized tomatoes started to ripen, it was not to their normal shade of bright yellow but to a weird--but quite unique--striated pattern of yellow and purple. They immediately suspected that their plants were being pollinated from those growing in the neighbouring greenhouse. 

After complaining to the neighbouring farmer that "genetic drift" from their GMO tomatoes was contaminating their heritage plot, the West Egg resident carried out their own research and discovered that it would be possible--though expensive--for the farmer to install screens that would prevent cross-pollination with other plants in the vicinity. The farmer refused to do this. 

The West Egg brings a claim in nuisance against the farmer asking for an injunction restraining them from continue to operate a tomato greenhouse facility using GMO tomatoes on the land.
