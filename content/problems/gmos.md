    explanation: To what extent is a claim in nuisance based on interference by genetic drift a novel claim, analogous to the one in the Victoria Park case? How might the novel claim in this week's problem be addressed by a court?

    explanation: How does the metaphor of the "bundle of sticks" help us to understand the focus this week on a property holder's "right to exclude"? 
  - url: content/cases/shelfer.md
    explanation: Distinct from the issue of whether or not a nuisance has been perpetrated by the defendant is the issue of remedy. What choices of remedy for a claim in nuisance are available and how does the Shelfer court purport to address this choice?

    explanation: The court in this case faces the task of justifying a remedy in damages for a nuisance claim related to environmental harms. What are those justifications and how do they different from other cases you read this week?

    explanation: Here, the court's majority agrees that an injunction is the appropriate remedy for a claim in nuisance for environmental harms. Why? What distinguishes this case from others on the same issue you read this week?

One of West Eggleston's more locally-famous residents grows exceptional, bright yellow heirloom tomatoes on a half-acre plot in the community, which they sell at their farm stand in the old Brewery Market in Halifax every weekend. Year after year, the success of these remarkable tomato plants is sustained through careful collection, storage, and planting of the seeds from the prior year's crop--ensuring that each tomato is a true (and delicious) reflection of its particular lineage. 

Recently one of the several farm properties neighbouring West Egg was purchased by a new farmer, who decided to introduce large-scale greenhouse tomato production. Based on their business plan to develop a new and unique product which they plan to sell directly to consumers at the Brewery Market and other outlets around the province, the new farmer decided to license the only available genetically-modified (GMO) tomato currently available on the market from US-based company called [Norfolk Plant Sciences](https://www.seedworld.com/europe/2023/01/13/the-future-of-the-purple-gm-tomato-lies-with-consumers/)--a tomato with rich purple fruit that is especially high in antioxidants. Under the terms of the license, the farmer pays a substantial annual fee to Norkfolk--who retains patent rights in the tomato's genetics--to use Norfolk's seed. The license specifically prohibits the licensee from saving and replanting seeds the following season or otherwise reproducing the tomato plants in any way.

Throughout the following growing season, the West Egg resident growing heritage tomatoes began to notice that their fruits were not ripening to the normal shade of bright yellow but instead were developing a novel striated pattern of yellow and purple. The grower immediately suspected that their plants had been pollinated--probably by local bees--from those growing in the greenhouse containing GMO tomatoes.

After complaining to the neighbouring farmer that "genetic drift" from their GMO tomatoes was contaminating the heritage plot, the West Egg resident carried out their own research and discovered that it would be possible--though expensive--for the farmer to install a new, prototype filtration system in the greenhouse's air exchange system that would prevent cross-pollination with other plants in the vicinity. Despite repeated pleas for the farmer of the GMO tomatoes to adopt this new technology, they have so far refused to do so.

The heritage tomato grower from West Egg ultimately decided to bring a claim in nuisance against the GMO farmer, asking for an injunction to restrain the defendant from operating a tomato greenhouse facility using GMO tomatoes on their land. 

**The main cases you will read this week (*Victoria Park*, *Canadian Copper*, and *Canadian Paper*) are each good examples of the classical style. Write a judgment resolving this dispute written in the classical style and applying the legal principles you learned from the readings, then explain briefly how you have relied on the assumptions implicit in the classical style to arrive at a decision.**
