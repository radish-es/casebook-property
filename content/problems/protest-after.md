## Hypothetical Facts

Suppose that, after recent events surrounding "Divest Dalhousie" protests at the University (see our [Week 1 problem](../protest)), Nova Scotia decides to enact special legislation that preserves and expands access to spaces for members of the public to engage in peaceful protest and other forms of collective association. The *Making Space for Nova Scotians Act* provides:

> 4 Where members of the public are exercising their freedom of collective association in outdoor spaces suitable for that activity, the *Protection of Property Act*, RSNS 1989, c 363 is of no force or effect.

[...]

> 7 Outdoor spaces where members of the public normally gather are hereby re-zoned to prohibit building development or the construction of permanent structures of any kind. 

## The Problem

**Assuming that Dalhousie was entitled to exclude protestors prior to the *Making Space for Nova Scotians Act*, did the Province of Nova Scotia expropriate Dalhousie's land by enacting this legislation? If so, what can the University do about it?**

## Answer Framework

Consider the following framework as you develop your answer to this week's problem.

**Issue 1: Does the *Making Space for Nova Scotians Act* apply to the Dalhousie quad?**

- The materials you read this week identify a key principle used to interpret legislation that affects  property rights. What is this principle and how could it be applied in Dalhousie's case?

**Issue 2: If the *Act* does apply, would Dalhousie be entitled to compensation for expropriation?**

- Based on what you have learned from the *McLaren* saga, from the debate between the judges in *Pennsylvania Coal Co. v Mahon*, and from the decision in *Manitoba Fisheries Ltd.*, do you think a claim by Dalhousie for compensation would be successful? Why or why not?

**The best place to start your readings this week is with the *McLaren v Caldwell* cases or with the short introduction to riparian rights.**
