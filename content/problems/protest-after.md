After the events of the [protest at West Eggleston]({{< ref "problems/protest" >}}), some MLAs and their allies began to pressure the provincial government to expand the access to places where members of the public can engage in peaceful protest and other forms of collective association. As a result of these efforts, the legislature passed an amendment to the *Public Highways Act*, RSNS 1989 c 371 which reads:

> 5A Where members of the public are exercising their freedom of collective association on roads, lanes, paths or highways, the provisions of the *Protection of Property Act*, RSNS 1989, c 363 are of no force or effect. 

The *Public Highways Act*, s. 2 currently defines a "highway" to be "a public highway or public road". 

After the above amendment was enacted, West Egg co-operative's board began to worry about the Act's implications for its residents' quiet enjoyment of their land. Not having any more resources in its annual budget to hire a lawyer, some of the board's members did their own research and discovered what seemed to be important provisions in the *Expropriation Act*, RSNS 1989, c 156.

**Did the Province of Nova Scotia expropriate the co-operative's land by amending the *Public Highway Act*, and if so what can the board do about it?**

## Answer Framework

Consider the following framework as you develop your answer to this week's problem.

**Issue 1 - Defining Expropriation: What does it mean for the state to "expropriate" land?**

- Start with the basic definition in Nova Scotia's *Expropriation Act*. This statute tells us something (but not everything) about how expropriation is defined.

- How do the parties, courts and legislatures in the *McLaren v Caldwell* saga frame and understand that case as one about expropriation? How could this frame be applied to understand our weekly problem? 

**Issue 2 - Statutory Interpretation: Making sense of section 5A of the *Public Highway Act***

- The question here is whether or not the amendment to the *Act* actually applies to the roads in West Egg. 

- That question is similar to the one asked in *McLaren v Caldwell*. What principle of statutory interpretation does the Supreme Court of Canada provide in that case that might help to answer this question in our problem?

**Issue 3: - Compensation for Expropriation: Applying the *Expropriation Act***

- If there is an argument that section 5A of the *Public Highway Act* should be interpreted as applying to the roads in West Egg, what claim might the co-op board make under the provincial *Expropriation Act*?

- Based on what you know from the wording of the *Expropriation Act*, do you think such a claim would be successful and why? What more would you need to know in order to answer this confidently question?
