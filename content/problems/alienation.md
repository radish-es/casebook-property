### Hypothetical Facts

Suppose that a testator (the legal term for a person making a will) owns a farm in New Brunswick that has been in their family for generations. The testator has a daughter who has always wanted to farm and the testator has always been supportive of this dream. But having heard about the Land Back movement--an Indigenous-led movement advocating for the return of Indigenous lands to Indigenous peoples--and having followed closely the progress of the Wolastoqey and Mi’gmawe’l Tplu’taqnn Inc. claims for recognition and affirmation of Aboriginal Title, the testator has developed a strong interest in--if somewhat limited understanding of--land justice in this context. The testator asks their lawyer to draft the following provision in their will:

> When I die, the farm goes to my daughter. When she can no longer make use of the land, it should go to Mi’gmawe’l Tplu’taqnn Inc (MTI), which organization should be prohibited from transferring the land to any other party for a period of 99 years, after which said organization may only transfer it to another Mik'maw-led entity. It is my hope that by this Last Will & Testament the Mi'kmaq will regain control and Aboriginal Title over some small parcel of their traditional territory. 

### The Problem

**Once the testator passes away, what interests in the farmland would be created through this will? Identify any specific problems with interpreting the will and discuss how the testator's intention for the bequest related to Aboriginal Title as you currently understand that concept.**
