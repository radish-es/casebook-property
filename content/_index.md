***Land+Property in Canada's Political Economy*** is an open digital casebook developed for learners and teachers in Canadian law schools. It uses a problem-based model to link modular content in ways that enable authors to tailor the book to their own perspectives and pedagogies and encourage learners to find pathways through the course material that best suit their own learning styles and experiences.
