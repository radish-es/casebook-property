# About the Coursebook

<div class="center"><a href="/"><img src="imgs/cover.jpg" style="max-width: 300px"></a></div>

***Landscapes*** is an open digital coursebook developed for learners and teachers in Canadian law schools as an alternative to the traditional first-year property law course. 

The coursebook in organized around a problem-based model to link modular content in ways that encourage learners to find multiple pathways through the course material that are defined by historical context as well as legal doctrine. This model also empowers authors to tailor the coursebook to their own perspectives, experiences and pedagogies.
