This page addresses "Frequently Asked Questions" about using the *Land+Property* casebook. 

## Do I need to read the material online using my computer?

In order to successfully review and prepare the weekly assigned readings, you will need to access the casebook via a browser on your computer. Because of the unique problem-based, hypertext model used in the casebook, this way of accessing the material allows you to draw connections between the readings by following different pathways (links). 

Having said that, either because of accessibility or preference, you may wish to download a PDF copy of the reading material--for example, to markup on your computer or to print in hard copy. To do this, simply navigate to the appropriate page and select ```File > Print``` and choose print to PDF. This should produce a well-formatted PDF free from menu items, etc. 

## How does the Creative Commons licence apply to AI-generated images used in the casebook?

The Canadian law related to copyright in materials produced using generative AI remains mostly speculative at this point (though specific AI-generators may impose specific conditions or limitations around copyright). To the extent that the basic rules of Canadian copyright law apply to AI-generated images used in the casebook, this material is covered directly by the Creative Commons licence. Alternatively, if copyright does not apply to AI-generated images (for example, because their creation through prompts is "purely mechanical" and lacks the requisite "skill and judgment") then those images are presumably already in the public domain and thus open sharing does not require a Creative Commons licence.
