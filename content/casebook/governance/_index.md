This second chapter is about *governance* -- the legal rules and frameworks that determine how decisions are made about land.

As in the other chapters, a motivating theme is to demonstrate how property law is not just a private law subject in the conventional sense. Governance occurs through nuisance (tort) and covenant (contract), but also through exercise of the police power.
