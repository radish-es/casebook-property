The origin of the trust lies in medieval tax estate planning and tax evasion. (Arguably, nothing has changed in the last six hundred years.) Imagine Osbert, a minor lord in the 15th century, who holds Greenacre as a tenant of Leonard, a slightly less minor lord. Osbert is getting on in years and has started to worry about the future of his family. His elder son, Aylwin, is not showing promising signs of maturity, and Osbert has come to think that Aylwin may be better suited to religious orders than the duties of managing a great estate. But Osbert’s younger son Bartholomew appears to be a fine young gentleman: athletic, patient, and wise in the ways of men. Osbert would like to provide for Aylwin, but would prefer to have Greenacre go to Bartholomew. Osbert’s problem is that the available conveyancing devices don’t work for him. If he does nothing, then Greenacre goes to Alywin at Osbert’s death under the rule of primogeniture in effect in England at the time, according to which the eldest son receives any land his father owned at his death (was “seised of,” in contemporary terminology). A will leaving Greenacre to Bartholomew doesn’t work because land could not be devised by will until the Statute of Wills in 1540. And Osbert doesn’t want to convey Greenacre (or a future interest in Greenacre) to Bartholomew now, because Bartholomew might die before him, or Aylwin might get his act together, or something else could come along to force a change in plan.

The solution hit on by contemporary lawyers was the “use.” Osbert conveys Greenacre to his friend Theobald “to the use of Osbert and his heirs.” Then he writes a letter to Theobald, instructing Theobald to convey Greenacre to Bartholomew at Osbert’s death. This works. When Osbert dies, Theobald owns Greenacre, so primogeniture never kicks in. Then Theobald conveys to Bartholomew while they are both alive, so again the conveyance is perfectly good. What’s more, Osbert can change his instructions to Theobald at any time by writing a new letter. And as an added bonus, because the land never passes by intestacy, the “feudal incidents”– effectively taxes payable to Leonard when a new tenant inherits – never become due. Uses became highly popular for solving numerous similar problems created by the inflexibility of the medieval system of interests in land.

But there was a fly in the ointment. As far as the law courts could see – or rather, as far as they were willing to look – the “to the use of” language was a superfluous, meaningless, and ineffective addition to an otherwise valid conveyance. On their view of the situation, Theobald owns Greenacre in fee simple once Osbert conveys to him. Osbert’s subsequent letter is a worthless piece of paper; much as if you wrote to Bill Gates telling him to convey to you some lakefront property in Washington. So if Theobald turned out to be untrustworthy and held on to Greenacre for himself or conveyed it to Aylwin contrary to Osbert’s instructions, Osbert’s plan would come to ruin. In such cases, Osbert and Bartholomew could obtain relief from the Chancellor, who would hold that Theobald was under a duty in equity and good conscience to follow Osbert’s instructions.

The use thus created what we would today call an “equitable interest” in land. Theobald remained the *legal* owner of Greenacre while he held it to the use of Osbert and his heirs, but Osbert was the *equitable* owner, since he could enforce his claims and instructions in a court of equity. Over time a variety of similar situations, in which Chancery would enforce interests in land legally owned by another, gave rise to a reasonably coherent body of equitable jurisdiction, equitable doctrine, and equitable interests in property.

The use is long gone, along with the medieval doctrines that necessitated it, but the modern trust shares its essential characteristics. A trust requires three people and one thing. The people are the *settlor*, who creates the trust; the *trustee*, who holds legal title to the trust property and is responsible for following the settlor’s instructions, and the *beneficiary*, who is entitled to receive distributions from the trust in accordance with the settlor’s instructions but does not directly control it. The thing is the trust *property* (or sometimes *res*, Latin for “thing,” or *corpus*, Latin for “body”), whose ownership is split between the trustee (with legal title) and the beneficiary (with equitable title).
