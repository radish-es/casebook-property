# The "Ordinary Casebook"

This part of the site organizes the course materials you will study through problems into a system that you would ordinarily expect to find in a conventional law school casebook. The central organizing ideas in this system are ***legal doctrines*** like "first possession" or "Aboriginal title". The doctrines progress more or less chronologically, as issues within each doctrinal area are adjudicated over time.

#### Watch out!

The "Ordinary Casebook" is here to provide you with an alternative perspective on the course materials and concepts we will study mainly via a problem-based approach. But do not fall into the trap of simply using the doctrines to prepare for exams. This might give you a good understanding of the formal law-on-the-books, but you will miss out entirely on the historical patterns that we find only by looking *across* doctrinal areas.
