At the risk of sounding dated, the importance of law "with respect to things" is about land. Too much of current introduction to the subject of property law is 

This does not mean that intellectual property or other topics are irrelevant or unimportant--far from it. But it does mean that an introductory understanding of "property"-especially a skeptical one--is better rooted in land. 

- The emphasis on IP has another consequence. IP topics are often framed, implicitly or explicitly, as rights that are "created" because they are entirely artificial (i.e. flowing from the nature of information and the need to incentivize creators through exclusionary IP rights). But there exist a start contrast in this treatment of IP with the treatment of property in land taken as "given" or naturalized in particular ways that ignores the reality that property in land is also created and that those processes of creation are situated directly in the context of landed colonialism.
