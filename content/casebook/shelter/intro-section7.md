In our discussion of acquired rights and the problem of regulating short-term rentals last week, we touched on the idea that a central issue for the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) and other municipal governments in Canada is access to affordable housing. There is growing awareness that Halifax is facing a crisis in housing affordability and a [dramatic rise in the number of people who experience chronic homelessness](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/homeless-report-2020-covid-19-affordable-housing-association-of-nova-scotia-1.5805458).

Addressing homelessness and access to housing engages a complex set of legal and policy issues, actors and decision-making networks. One aspect of this context in which Canadian courts have been especially active is the constitutional right of homeless persons to access and shelter in public spaces—namely, municipal parks—in order to meet their immediate needs. As the problem below describes, the role of these rights and challenges to their realization gained national attention in Halifax in summer 2021, after a series of forced evictions of people living in temporary and emergency shelters on municipal lands.

Our goal this week is to explore how rights to access public property in the shelter context have emerged and evolved in the common law courts, primarily through a series of cases in British Columbia since the mid-2000s. We will aim to understand the changing scope of these rights over time, and grapple with the implications of courts' heavy reliance on a functionalist approach to the right to shelter in this context.

#### Right to Shelter under the *Charter* ####

Canada's *Charter of Rights and Freedoms* contains no freestanding constitutional right to housing or other forms of shelter. But in considering what protections the *Charter* affords to unhoused persons seeking access to public spaces to meet their immediate shelter and other basic needs, Canadian courts have developed certain limited protections under section 7 of the *Charter*, which reads:

> 7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.

In our course, we will not undertake a comprehensive analysis of section 7 rights, but instead focus on a few specific features of an emerging right to shelter in the context of access to public property. This topic has a great deal to teach us about the development and implications of the modern legal style.

#### Introduction to *Bamberger* and the Evolving Right to Shelter ####

The British Columbia Supreme Court's recent decision in *Bamberger*, below, helps to track the evolution of the right to shelter through subsequent decisions. Is the right to shelter extended or modified here, and what are the implications for potential claims in the context of our Halifax case study, above?
