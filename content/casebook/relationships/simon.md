## Dickson C.J.C. -- 

This case raises the important question of the interplay between
the treaty rights of native peoples and provincial legislation. The
right to hunt, which remains important to the livelihood and way of life
of the Micmac people, has come into conflict with game preservation
legislation in effect in the Province of Nova Scotia. The main question
before this Court is whether, pursuant to a Treaty of 1752 between the
British Crown and the Micmac, and to s. 88 of the *Indian Act*, R.S.C.
1970, c. 1-6, the appellant, James Matthew Simon, enjoys hunting rights
which preclude his prosecution for offences under the *Lands and Forests
Act*, R.S.N.S. 1967, c. 163.

The appellant is a member of the Shubenacadie Indian Brook Band
(No. 2) of the Micmac people and a registered Indian under the *Indian
Act*. He was charged under s. 150(1) of the *Lands and Forests Act* with
possession of a rifle and shotgun cartridges.

The Treaty of 1752, the relevant part of which states at article
4 that the Micmacs have "free liberty of Hunting & Fishing as usual",
provides:

> Treaty or Articles of Peace and Friendship Renewed between His Excellency Peregrine Thomas Hopson Esquire Captain General and Governor in Chief in and over His Majesty's Province of Nova Scotia or Acadie. Vice Admiral of the same & Colonel of one of His Majesty's Regiments of Foot, and His Majesty's Council on behalf of His Majesty and Major Jean Baptiste Cope, chief Sachem of the Tribe of Mick Mack Indians Inhabiting the Eastern Coast of the said Province, and Andrew Hadley Martin, Gabriel Martin & Francis Jeremiah, Members and Delegates of the said Tribe, for themselves and their said Tribe their Heirs, and the Heirs of their Heirs forever, Begun made and concluded in the manner, form and Tenor following, vizt:

#### Was the Treaty of 1752 Validly Created by Competent Parties?

The respondent raised the issue of the capacity of the parties
for two reasons which are stated at p. 8 of the factum:

> The issue of capacity is raised for the purpose of illustrating that the
Treaty of 1752 was of a lesser status than an International Treaty and
therefore is more easily terminated. The issue is also raised to give
the document an historical legal context as this issue has been raised
in previous cases.

The question of whether the Treaty of 1752 constitutes an
international-type treaty is only relevant to the respondent's argument
regarding the appropriate legal tests for the termination of the Treaty.
I will address this issue, therefore, in relation to the question of
whether the Treaty of 1752 was terminated by hostilities between the
British and the Micmac in 1753.

The historical legal context provided by the respondent consists
primarily of the 1929 decision of Acting Judge Patterson in *R. v.
Syliboy*, \[1929\] 1 D.L.R. 307 (Co. Ct.) and the academic commentary it
generated immediately following its rendering. In the *Syliboy* case
Patterson J. addressed the question of the capacity of the parties to
enter into a treaty at pp. 313-14:

> Two considerations are involved. First, did the Indians of Nova Scotia
have status to enter into a treaty? And second, did Governor Hopson have
authority to enter into one with them? Both questions must I think be
answered in the negative.
>
> \(1\) "Treaties are unconstrained Acts of independent powers." But the
Indians were never regarded as an independent power. A civilized nation
first discovering a country of uncivilized people or savages held such
country as its own until such time as by treaty it was transferred to
some other civilized nation. The savages' rights of sovereignty even of
ownership were never recognized. Nova Scotia had passed to Great Britain
not by gift or purchase from or even by conquest of the Indians but by
treaty with France, which had acquired it by priority of discovery and
ancient possession; and the Indians passed with it.
>
>Indeed the very fact that certain Indians sought from the Governor the
privilege or right to hunt in Nova Scotia as usual shows that they did
not claim to be an independent nation owning or possessing their lands.
If they were, why go to another nation asking this privilege or right
and giving promise of good behaviour that they might obtain it? In my
judgment the Treaty of 1752 is not a treaty at all and is not to be
treated as such; it is at best a mere agreement made by the Governor and
council with a handful of Indians giving them in return for good
behaviour food, presents, and the right to hunt and fish as usual --- an
agreement that, as we have seen, was very shortly after broken.
>
> \(2\) Did Governor Hopson have authority to make a treaty? I think not.
"Treaties can be made only by the constituted authorities of nations or
by persons specially deputed by them for that purpose." Clearly our
treaty was not made with the constituted authorities of Great Britain.
But was Governor Hopson specially deputed by them? Cornwallis'
commission is the manual not only for himself but for his successors and
you will search it in vain for any power to sign treaties.

It should be noted that the language used by Patterson J.,
illustrated in this passage, reflects the biases and prejudices of
another era in our history. Such language is no longer acceptable in
Canadian law and indeed is inconsistent with a growing sensitivity to
native rights in Canada. With regard to the substance of Patterson J.'s
words, leaving aside for the moment the question of whether treaties are
international-type documents, his conclusions on capacity are not
convincing.

No court, with the exception of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court,
Appeal Division in the present case, has agreed explicitly with the
conclusion of Patterson J. that the Indians and Governor Hopson lacked
capacity to enter into an enforceable treaty. The Treaty of 1752 was
implicitly assumed to have been validly created in *R. v. Simon* (1958),
124 C.C.C. 100 (N.B.C.A.); *R. v. Francis* (1969), 10 D.L.R. (3d) 189
(N.B.C.A.); *R. v. Paul* (1980), 30 N.B.R. (2d) 545 (C.A.); *R. v. Cope,
supra; R. v. Atwin and Sacobie*, \[1981\] 2 C.N.L.R. 99 (N.B. Prov.
Ct.); *R. v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex
parte Indian Association of Alberta*, \[1982\] 2 All E.R. 118 (C.A.);
*R. v. Paul and Polchies* (1984), 58 N.B.R. (2d) 297 (Prov. Ct.) In *R.
v. Isaac, supra*, Cooper J.A., after noting Patterson J.'s conclusions
on the validity of the Treaty of 1752, expressed doubt as to their
correctness, at p. 496:

> The *Treaty of 1752* was considered in *Rex v. Syliboy*\.... It was
there held by Patterson, Acting C.C.J., that it did not extend to Cape
Breton Indians and further that it was not in reality a treaty. I have
doubt as to the second finding and express no opinion on it, but I have
no doubt as to the correctness of the first finding.

N.A.M. MacKenzie, in "Indians and Treaties in Law" (1929), 7
*Can. Bar Rev.* 561, disagreed with Patterson J.'s ruling that the
Indians did not have the capacity, nor the Governor the authority, to
conclude a valid treaty. MacKenzie stated at p. 565:

> As to the capacity of the Indians to contract and the authority of
Governor Hopson to enter into such an agreement, with all deference to
His Honour, both seem to have been present. Innumerable treaties and
agreements of a similar character were made by Great Britain, France,
the United States of America and Canada with the Indian tribes
inhabiting this continent, and these treaties and agreements have been
and still are held to be binding.Nor would Governor Hopson require
special "powers" to enter into such an agreement. Ordinarily "full
powers" specially conferred are essential to the proper negotiating of a
treaty, but the Indians were not on a par with a sovereign state and
fewer formalities were required in their case. Governor Hopson was the
representative of His Majesty and as such had sufficient authority to
make an agreement with the Indian tribes.

The Treaty was entered into for the benefit of both the British
Crown and the Micmac people, to maintain peace and order as well as to
recognize and confirm the existing hunting and fishing rights of the
Micmac. In my opinion, both the Governor and the Micmac entered into the
Treaty with the intention of creating mutually binding obligations which
would be solemnly respected. It also provided a mechanism for dispute
resolution. The Micmac Chief and the three other Micmac signatories, as
delegates of the Micmac people, would have possessed full capacity to
enter into a binding treaty on behalf of the Micmac. Governor Hopson was
the delegate and legal representative of His Majesty The King. It is
fair to assume that the Micmac would have believed that Governor Hopson,
acting on behalf of His Majesty The King, had the necessary authority to
enter into a valid treaty with them. I would hold that the Treaty of
1752 was validly created by competent parties.

#### Does the Treaty Contain a Right to Hunt and What is the Nature and Scope of this Right?

Article 4 of the Treaty of 1752 states, "It is agreed that the
said Tribe of Indians shall not be hindered from, but have free liberty
of Hunting & Fishing as usual\...." What is the nature and scope of the
"liberty of Hunting & Fishing" contained in the Treaty?

The majority of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal seemed to imply
that the Treaty contained merely a general acknowledgement of
pre-existing non-treaty aboriginal rights and not an independent source
of protection of hunting rights upon which the appellant could rely. In
my opinion, the Treaty, by providing that the Micmac should not be
hindered from but should have free liberty of hunting and fishing as
usual, constitutes a positive source of protection against infringements
on hunting rights. The fact that the right to hunt already existed at
the time the Treaty was entered into by virtue of the Micmac's general
aboriginal right to hunt does not negate or minimize the significance of
the protection of hunting rights expressly included in the Treaty.

Such an interpretation accords with the generally accepted view
that Indian treaties should be given a fair, large and liberal
construction in favour of the Indians. This principle of interpretation
was most recently affirmed by this Court in *Nowegijick v. The Queen*,
\[1983\] 1 S.C.R. 29. I had occasion to say the following at p. 36:

> It is legal lore that, to be valid, exemptions to tax laws should be
clearly expressed. It seems to me, however, that treaties and statutes
relating to Indians should be liberally construed and doubtful
expressions resolved in favour of the Indians. \...In *Jones v. Meehan*,
175 U.S. 1 (1899), it was held that Indian treaties "must \... be
construed, not according to the technical meaning of \[their\] words
\... but in the sense in which they would naturally be understood by the
Indians".

Having determined that the Treaty embodies a right to hunt, it
is necessary to consider the respondent's contention that the right to
hunt is limited to hunting for purposes and by methods usual in 1752
because of the inclusion of the modifier "as usual" after the right to
hunt.

First of all, I do not read the phrase "as usual" as refering to
the types of weapons to be used by the Micmac and limiting them to those
used in 1752. Any such construction would place upon the ability of the
Micmac to hunt an unnecessary and artificial constraint out of keeping
with the principle that Indian treaties should be liberally construed.
Indeed, the inclusion of the phrase "as usual" appears to reflect a
concern that the right to hunt be interpreted in a flexible way that is
sensitive to the evolution of changes in normal hunting practices. The
phrase thereby ensures that the Treaty will be an effective source of
protection of hunting rights.

Secondly, the respondent maintained that "as usual" should be
interpreted to limit the treaty protection to hunting for non-commercial
purposes. It is difficult to see the basis for this argument in the
absence of evidence regarding the purpose for which the appellant was
hunting. In any event, article 4 of the Treaty appears to contemplate
hunting for commercial purposes when it refers to the construction of a
truck house as a place of exchange and mentions the liberty of the
Micmac to bring game to sale: see *R. v. Paul, supra*, at p. 563 *per*
Ryan J.A., dissenting in part.

It should be clarified at this point that the right to hunt to
be effective must embody those activities reasonably incidental to the
act of hunting itself, an example of which is travelling with the
requisite hunting equipment to the hunting grounds. In this case, the
appellant was not charged with hunting in a manner contrary to public
safety in violation of the *Lands and Forests Act* but with illegal
possession of a rifle and ammunition upon a road passing through or by a
forest, wood or resort of moose or deer contrary to s.150(1) of the same
Act. The appellant was simply travelling in his truck along a road with
a gun and some ammunition. He maintained that he was going to hunt in
the vicinity. In my opinion, it is implicit in the right granted under
article 4 of the Treaty of 1752 that the appellant has the right to
possess a gun and ammunition in a safe manner in order to be able to
exercise the right to hunt. Accordingly, I conclude that the appellant
was exercising his right to hunt under the Treaty.
