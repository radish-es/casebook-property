### Míkmaq Tenure in Prerogative Treaties

Mikmaq attitudes toward sharing of the sacred space are evident in
almost every treaty with the British Crown. The prerogative Treaties
reserve their land tenure and beneficial interest under the protection of the
Crown and separate from the provinces. These Treaties were forged
from the ancient ecological covenants with the Keepers of the *Mntu* and
from their *Nikmanen* law. The context for the prerogative Treaties was the
ancient Nikmanen [Míkmaw transnational legal] Order.

[...]

The Nikmanen Order illustrates the development of a voluntary
transnational law that was not based on the family structure. Instead the
order was based on consensual agreements among the Indigenous federations and European monarchies. The Europeans were careful to record
the Míkmaq's Nikmanen or transnational confederations. Confronted
with a well-populated land, an organized government and an elegant
economic order, the Europeans were forced to develop new concepts of
law and rights to deal with the allied people and their vast system of
"friends". From a Nikmanen perspective, relations with the Europeans or
guests were part of a continuous process of trying to make peace or
staying neutral in European conflicts.

Sometimes the allies cooperated in raids (called "wars" by Europeans)
against common enemies, particularly against the Mohawk and the "Armochiquois". The purposes of these raids were not for territorial
acquisition or wealth, but rather they were seen as means to end a conflict
or enforce customary international trading laws. The *Nikmanen* order
was not based on a negotiated peace, but rather maintaining and strengthening the peace. They saw peace as a state of mind calling for self-discipline and forgiveness. They understood that a crisis-based council could not implement a policy of disengagement. Presents and satisfactions for the military raids and the loss suffered encouraged good feelings,
amity, and international harmony.

A united Confederacy emerged from these conflicts, and created the
Nikmanen Order. At the time of the arrival of the Europeans, the
Wabanaki Confederacy comprised the Penobscot, Passamaquoddy,
Malecite, and the Míkmaq. It was united with the Ottawa Confederacy,
comprising the Mohawk of Caughnawaga and Oka, the Têtes de Boule,
and the Ottawa. The extended confederacy of more than fourteen
nations had several descriptions. This continental Confederacy,
usually called Great Council Fire by the Wabanaki, was renewed in 1701 and 1749, and extended the alliance to the Lakes Confederacy of the
Obijwa and the Cree (*Nehiywaw*) Confederacy, who were related to
the Blackfoot and Lakota Confederacies. This interconnectedness was
continued in the treaty process with the Crown.

The extension of indigenous transnational law to include the British
Sovereign is reflected in the Treaties. The early Treaties can be viewed
as an extended Aboriginal system of tensions or bridges linking different
worldviews to a consensual order. The Georgian treaties typically were
made according to Aboriginal, rather than European, protocols. The
Aboriginal Nations conceived of Treaties as living agreements rather
than mere documents. Often the cordiality of the annual meeting and
discussion was seen as more important than the substance of the terms.
Propositions were made orally at conferences and agreed to one by one
with the exchange of symbolic gifts or wampum. Beyond the particular
framework of obligations or rights agreed upon, the agreements created
a permanent, living relationship. Typically this relationship was expressed in terms of an extended kinship-the King as "father" and the
colonist as "brothers". This is consistent with an indigenous worldview.

To preserve the kinship, as within a natural family, the Aboriginal
nations and the representatives of the King were obliged to meet from
time to time to renew the friendship, to reconcile misunderstandings, and
to share with each other understandings, experiences and wealth. Thus
most of the treaties were in reality renewal ceremonies of subsisting
relationships. In documentary form these ceremonies mostly consisted of
a transcript of the proceedings and the substance of the agreement
summarizing the nature of the international kinship. This was often
characterized by the metaphor of the chain. By European standards the
agreements were often unnervingly succinct, even vague, but this was not
the result of failure to agree, nor of naiveté. It was the result of abiding by
tribal protocol and worldviews, the acceptance by the British Sovereign
of the aboriginal flexible, kin like nature of the confederation. These
treaties were never intended to locate the Aboriginal nations under the
Crown's direct authority or under the immigrant governments, since they
had no concept of rules from above and did not tolerate such a conception
of rule. The treaties were a partnership. They merely created a consensual
order and a protective relationship reflecting both an Aboriginal view
of order and procedure, and a Eurocentric view of order.

The prerogative Treaties enabled the two worldviews and different societies to make a new normative world using the irony of jurisdictions, obligations and rights. To live in the new legal world required each culture to know not only the meaning of the alliance and its terms, but also the connections or transformations that resulted when one normative system passed through another. The prerogative Treaties constructed, through mutual consent, a new normative system out of the various constructions of reality and visions of what the world might be.

For example, the Wabanaki and Míkmaq applied the customary concept of harmony and forgiveness to the English. Specifically, article 2 of the *Mikmaw Compact*, 1752, stated that "all Transactions during the Late War on both sides be buried in Oblivion with the Hatchet." This fragile quest for an explicit order between the diverse federations through consensual Treaties provided the foundation upon which developed the first British Empire and their colonies, and eventually the United Kingdom.

[...]

The relationship between the Míkmaq and the land embodies the
essence of the intimate sacred order. As humans, they have and retain an
obligation to protect the order and a right to share its uses, but only the
future unborn children in the invisible sacred realm of the next seven
generations had any ultimate ownership of the land. In the custom of the
 Míkmaq, the Santé Mawíomi was and is the trustee of the sacred order and
territory for the future generations. Part of its duty is to regulate the natural
resources of Míkmáki among the allied people and through the Nikmanen
trading customs increase the bio-diversity. This is more of a management
right to ensure discipline in consumption of the resources, rather than the
concept of ownership.

Inherent in this sacred order is the conviction that the resources had to
be renewed as well as shared. Rather than managed, which implied
human domination, the Míkmaq developed rituals for sharing or harmonizing
the human and spiritual realms. These renewal rituals and
ceremonies brought the people and the land into balance thereby 
achieving basic subsistence and material well-being. These rituals and 
ceremonies created a harmony which emphasized stability and the minimization
of risk for the harvesting of the resources rather than growth and the
accumulation of wealth. The quest for harmony also created the need for
diversification by trade and modification of habitats, thereby 
developing surplus capacities and sharing.
