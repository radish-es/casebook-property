Last week we studied the historical roots of the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title and saw, in *St. Catherine's Milling*, how classical legal thought framed the courts' conclusion that Indigenous land rights were "personal" rather than "proprietary". We left off with the observation that beneath the issue of Aboriginal title foregrounded in *St. Catherine's Milling* was the doctrine of *terra nullius* ("land belonging to no one"). Aspects of *terra nullius*—paired with the doctrine of discovery—undergird courts' continued assumption of Crown sovereignty and the exclusion of Indigenous sovereignties up to the present day. One consequence of this doctrine has been to largely exclude Indigenous legal orders from the consciousness of the common law.

The path charted by the courts at the end of the nineteenth century, however, was not the only possibility. An alternative to *terra nullius*, we might say, is *treaty*—a legal relationship between nations defining their scope of authority and mutual obligations. Such relationships are based on the shared recognition that each party to the treaty holds authority to govern according to their own systems of law.

Treaty relationships between Indigenous nations and the Crown are widespread in Canada, but they are also diverse and difficult to generalize. This week we will focus on the treaty context in Mi'kma'ki / Atlantic Canada to understand how the Peace and Friendship Treaties were established in the mid-eighteenth century and then interpreted in the classical period. We will see that, with the Nova Scotia County Court's decision in *R v Syliboy*, common law treaty interpretation in the region became highly restrictive and was based on a rejection of the idea of nation-to-nation relationships and of Mi'kmaw systems of law and governance. 

Nevertheless, Mi'kmaq people have continued to use and develop these systems of law and governance. We will look at one description of Mi'kmaw land tenure and ask how we might understand this system in comparison to the structures of common law reasoning we have studied so far in the course.
