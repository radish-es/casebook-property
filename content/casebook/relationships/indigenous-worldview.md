The common law approach to possession and communicating possession is not a universal one. Notice how James (sákéj) Youngblood Henderson inverts the common law's concept of "possession" as he describes an Indigenous conception of belonging *to* land. In addition, consider the way Henderson engages with some of the common law rationales for property rights regimes we looked at previously... <!--this idea probably needs to be expanded or made more specific but I wasn't sure how to do it without knowing how we'll describe the rationales.-->
> [A]n Aboriginal worldview is a spatial consciousness rather than material consciousness. Sharing and mobility discourages the accumulation of inessential resources. The sharing of space, then, is the meaning for all of Aboriginal life. The relations contained in those spaces shape both choice and placement and ultimately group life. Aboriginal people do not speak of living "there"; rather, each family or person "belongs" to the space. Belonging, then, is directly tied both linguistically and experientially to a space as well as to shared knowledge of a series of common places. Belonging to a space is more than just living in a place or using its resources; it is attendant with benefits and obligations. Belonging is viewed as a special responsibility.[^henderson1] 
 
Henderson also offers a specific example of how this kind of belonging is communicated as part of the Mi'kmaw system of land tenure: 
> Renewal ceremonies also emphasize the relationship between space and claims in the indigenous Mikmaw worldview. The places of certain ceremonies are bounded to a specific location and can be transported. They symbolically reiterated and renewed the ancient relationships between a particular family and people and a particular ecosystem. The grounding in a particular ecosystem has been categorized as "geopiety". 
> In the renewal ceremonies, various family claims are continually being asserted and adjusted. While each renegotiation affects family allegiance and identity, this is seen as relatively unimportant; the crucial factor is the periodic equalization of shared rights among the collective families.[^henderson2] 
Keep in mind how Henderson's description of renewal ceremonies relates to (or conflicts with) ways of communicating possession within the common law tradition.
