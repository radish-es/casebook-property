### Overview

Can private landowners gain title over municipal parkland through
adverse possession? This is the central question raised on this appeal.
The application judge answered this question by finding that municipal
parkland is immune to adverse possession. While I would not accept such
an immunity arises at common law, I conclude the application judge was
correct in finding that the municipal parkland at issue in this case was
not available for adverse possession. For the reasons that follow, I
would dismiss the appeal.

The appellants own a property near the Humber River on the
southeast corner of Lundy Avenue and Warren Crescent. There are 26 other
residential properties east of the appellants' property. The City of
Toronto is the registered owner of a strip of land on the south side of
these properties (the "City Lands"). For simplicity, the City Lands can
be described as comprising three sections (as represented on the diagram
below): i) a laneway that runs along the southern boundary of the
properties and which has been used for over 40 years to access the
rear-facing garages of the residential properties on Warren Crescent
(Part 1 in the diagram below); ii) a trapezoid-like parcel of land
behind the appellants' single-family house, which has been fenced and
used exclusively by the owners of the appellants' property since at
least 1971 (the "Disputed Land" identified as Parts 2 and 3 in the
diagram below); and iii) a rectangular parcel of land, which the City
consented to transfer to the appellants' easterly neighbour (Part 4 in
the diagram below).

The City Lands are adjacent to Étienne Brûlé Park, a park that
runs along a section of the Humber River. The City's Official Plan
designates this park and the Disputed Land as part of the City's "Green
Space System". According to the City, the Green Space System is
comprised of those lands that are large and have significant natural
heritage or recreational value. In particular, within this system, the
Disputed Land is designated as "Parks and Open Space Areas", intended to
provide public parks and recreational opportunities. It is official City
policy to discourage the sale and disposal of lands in the Green Space
System, such as the Disputed Land.

Sometime between 1958 and 1971, a fence was erected by the
then-owners of the appellants' property around the Disputed Land,
enclosing it within the backyard of the appellants' house. The public
has not been able to access the Disputed Land since at least this time.

The appellants use the Disputed Land as a play area for their
children and maintain it as part of their backyard. The appellants have
paid realty taxes on the Disputed Land, and the City accepted those
payments until 2020. The appellants approached the City about purchasing
the disputed lands in 2021. The City, based on its policy, refused to
sell, so the appellants brought a claim for adverse possession.

### Decision Below

The application judge found the appellants' claim would have met
the threshold for adverse possession, as the Disputed Land was fenced in
by the previous owners of the property since at least 1971, with no
objection from the City. The previous owners of the appellants'
property, as well as the appellants, have maintained undisrupted and
exclusive possession of the Disputed Land.

While the facts at hand would have led to ownership arising from
adverse possession if the dispute is between private parties, the
application judge found that publicly owned land of this kind is immune
to claims for adverse possession.

The application judge reviewed the history of public ownership of
the Disputed Land. In 1958, the City Lands, which include the Disputed
Land, were expropriated by the Metropolitan Toronto and Region
Conservation Authority (the "Conservation Authority") as part of a
larger stretch of land bordering the Humber River. The application judge
found that the City Lands were "taken for public use" and that
"'expropriation' by its very nature is an action for public purposes."

The application judge found that, in 1971, these City Lands were
conveyed by the Conservation Authority to the City for a nominal sum of
\$2.00. One of the components of the City Lands, the public laneway,
allowed access for the residents' rear-facing garages. The application
judge reviewed the record with respect to the Disputed Land after the
conveyance and concluded, at para. 54:

> \[54\] Until this application seeking an adverse possession claim, there
was no evidence that the City was aware of the lands being public; nor
that any city funds have been expended to maintain the disputed lands.
It stands to reason that this was, in part, because the applicants'
predecessors had fenced off and excluded the land from the public.

The application judge characterized the property owners'
extended fencing of the parkland as a deprivation of a reasonable use of
the Disputed Land by the public. The application judge found that the
Disputed Land could be put to use for the public benefit. The Disputed
Land is part of a public park, and the City has plans to turn it into an
access point to Étienne Brûlé park and the 29-kilometre Humber River
Recreational Trail. She found that for over 50 years, "the property
owners encroached on public lands with fencing to exclude public use. By
their actions, they significantly narrowed the very access area to the
public park."

The application judge concluded that public parkland is immune
to claims for adverse possession. She found that "a private individual
must not be able to acquire title by encroaching on public lands and
fencing off portions for their private use in the manner of two private
property owners". The lands were originally required for a "very high
public interest" --- they were expropriated for a public purpose and
conveyed to the City as parkland. If allowed, the application judge
reasoned, this would set a "dangerous precedent".

### Analysis

The sole issue on this appeal is whether the application judge
erred in finding that the appellants could not succeed in their claim
for adverse possession over the Disputed Land. To resolve this issue, I
must consider two questions: first, whether the application judge
applied the proper adverse possession analysis to the facts of this
case; second, whether the *Real Property Limitations Act*, R.S.O. 1990,
c. L.15 ("*RPLA*") affects this analysis, and specifically whether, as
the appellants argue, the operation of the *RPLA* supersedes the common
law and governs this dispute.

#### **(1) The Common Law Scheme for Adverse Possession Claims**

In *Nelson (City) v. Mowatt* 2017 SCC 8, \[2017\] 1 S.C.R. 138,
at para. 17, Brown J. describes the common law basis for adverse
possession as follows:

> Adverse possession is a long-standing common law device by which the
right of the prior possessor of land, typically the holder of registered
title and therefore sometimes referred to as the "true owner", may be
displaced by a trespasser whose possession of the land goes unchallenged
for a prescribed period of time. From as early as *The Limitation Act,
1623* (Eng.), 21 Jas. 1, c. 16, the prior possessor's right to recover
possession was curtailed by limitation periods.

Adverse possession at common law is established where the
claimant had (i) actual, open, notorious, constant, continuous and
peaceful possession of the subject land for the statutory period of 10
years; (ii) an intention to exclude the true owner from possession; and
(iii) effective exclusion of the true owner for the entire 10-year
statutory period: *Billimoria v. Mistry* 2022 ONCA 276, 470 D.L.R. (4th)
406, at para. 27, citing *Vivekanandan v. Terzian* 2020 ONCA 110, 443
D.L.R. (4th) 678, at para. 21.

Canadian courts have treated adverse possession in the context
of public lands at common law as distinct. In part, this is because the
common law rationales for adverse possession between two private parties
do not apply to publicly owned property.

Scholars have posited three rationales at common law for adverse
possession between private parties. First, the doctrine of adverse
possession penalizes landowners who "sleep on their rights" and rewards
the "working possessor" --- the "reward-penalty" explanation. Second,
based on similar reasoning, the doctrine encourages land to be put to
its best, or most productive, use. Third, the doctrine encourages
property owners to monitor their property and resolve any boundary,
title, or other disputes, expeditiously, and in doing so, "protects the
settled expectations of an adverse possessor who has acted on the
assumption that her occupation will not be disturbed": see Bruce Ziff,
*Principles of Property Law*, 6th ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 2014), at pp.
141-45. See also Jeffrey E. Stake, "The Uneasy Case for Adverse
Possession" (2001) 89 Geo L.J. 2419. None of these rationales have
application against a municipal parkland.

First, a municipal authority which allocates land-use according
to statute cannot be said to "sleep on its rights" in relation to land
designated as parkland, or for conservation or as an open space.

Second, adverse possession cannot be said to result in better
uses of land than those pursued by public authorities. As reflected in
municipal zoning laws, there is an important public interest in the
allocation of land for different uses, including land for transportation
and industry, land for residential development and land for parkland,
conservation or open spaces.

Third, it is not realistic to expect a municipality to monitor
the entirety of its land for signs of encroachment. As the application
judge in this case observed, at para. 74, "The City is simply unable to
patrol all its lands against such adverse possessors. The courts cannot
demand the same vigilance of a private landowner to watch its borders of
a public entity." Further, where private parties object to the municipal
zoning of particular land for particular uses, there are statutory
dispute resolution processes which must be followed. Therefore, the
rationale of encouraging monitoring and settling disputes also has
little if any application in the context of adverse possession of
municipal parkland.

Indeed, it is difficult to identify *any* rationale for adverse
possession against municipal parkland. However, save where adverse
possession of public lands has been barred by statute, the common law
has developed analytical approaches that leave open, at least in some
circumstances, that adverse possession against such property remains
possible.

In his chapter on "Capacity to Hold and Deal with Interests in
Land" in Anne Warner La Forest, *Anger & Honsberger Law of Real
Property*, 3rd ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 2006), at §24:10, G. Thomas
Johnson summarizes this principle as follows:

> Municipalities, cities and towns have the power to acquire property by
dedication, by devise, and by prescription. A town council which is
authorized to expropriate land for specified purposes cannot exercise
that power for different purposes. Where legislation has prescribed the
mode of acquiring property, any other mode of acquisition is excluded.
For example, the power to acquire land for a housing project does not
permit a council to acquire shares in the corporation which owns the
necessary land.

> *The right of ownership in real property held by a city or town for the
common benefit or use of its inhabitants or of the Queen's subjects in
general (i.e., a highway) is of such a public character that it cannot,
as a general rule, be lost by adverse possession over the prescriptive
period.* \[Footnotes omitted; emphasis added.\]

In *Hughes v. Fredericton (City)* 216 N.B.R. (2d) 387, at para.
10, aff'd 225 N.B.R. (2d) 264 (C.A.), the court cited the emphasized
passage above with approval. The court accepted, at para. 12, that at
common law, municipal land zoned as parkland is held in trust for the
public, and *generally* not available for adverse possession:

> I find that the entire portion of the land acquired by the City of
Fredericton was zoned for parkland and there was a clear intention that
it was acquired for public use. It would be difficult, if not
impossible, for a claimant to acquire such land by adverse possession.
*As soon as the land was zoned for parkland for public use, it was held
in trust by the City for the public.* \[Emphasis added.\]

#### **The Development of the Public Benefit Test in the Common Law of Adverse Possession in Relation to Public Lands**

Faced with the fact-specific analysis of adverse possession in
the context of municipal land, where it is generally not available for
adverse possession but where no complete bar or immunity is applicable,
courts have developed a "public benefit" test to determine whether the
municipal land at issue is immune from adverse possession.

In *Hackett v. Colchester South (Twp.)*, \[1928\] S.C.R. 255,
Duff J. stated in *obiter* remarks he was "much impressed" by the
proposition that lands dedicated to public use and duly accepted by a
municipality give rise to rights of enjoyment by the general public. He
characterized these rights as "closely analogous to the rights of the
public in respect of a public highway", and the title of the
municipality in such lands should not be capable of being nullified by
claims of adverse possession: at p. 256.

In light of *Colchester*, subsequent decisions rejected adverse
possession claims against municipal lands, reasoning that it is
inconsistent with the "high public interest purpose" to which those
lands were or could be put: *Woychyshyn v. Ottawa (City)* 2009 88 R.P.R.
(4th) 155 (Ont. S.C.), at para. 13, and *Prescott & Russell (United
Counties) v. Waugh* 2004 15 M.P.L.R. (4th) 314 (Ont. S.C.).

In *Prescott & Russell*, Charbonneau J. found that municipal
land that had been acquired for public forestry purposes could not be
lost by adverse possession any more than the rest of the forest into
which that land had been incorporated. Charbonneau J. held, at para. 21:

> When a municipality acquires lands for forestry purposes a very high
public interest purpose arises as can be seen by the meaning the
legislature has ascribed to that expression. It makes eminent sense
that, in order to protect this vital public interest and as a matter of
public policy, lands held by a municipality in such circumstances cannot
be the subject of a claim for adverse possession.

In *Woychyshyn*, at para. 13, Ray J. dismissed a claim for
possessory title to municipal parkland registered to the City of Ottawa,
reasoning that there is a high public interest in maintaining such
lands:

> I have serious doubts that municipally owned land can be subject to a
claim for possessory title. The Respondent's evidence included a
description of the complex procedures and processes required before
municipal property can be disposed of. It suggests there is a high
public interest in the preservation of municipal property. It should not
be disposed of easily. A loss of property through adverse possession
would be contrary to this high public interest.

In *Oro-Medonte (Township) v. Warkentin*, 2013 ONSC 1416, Howden
J. found that a lakeshore promenade owned by the Township, but used and
maintained in part by owners of lake-front lots, was immune from adverse
possession. In reaching this conclusion, Howden J. summarized these
earlier precedents and proposed the following test, at para. 119:

> \[L\]ands held by a municipality other than as public road allowances
which meet the following factors are immune from claims of neighbouring
landowners based on prescriptive rights or adverse possession:

> (i) the land was purchased by or dedicated to the municipality for
the use or benefit of the public, or as here, for the use or benefit of
an entire subdivision as well as the public at large; and

> (ii) since its acquisition by the municipality, the land has been
used by and of benefit to the public.

Howden J. set out the rationale underlying the "public benefit"
test. He stated that land acquired by a municipality and used for public
purposes should be understood as being held in trust for the benefit of
the public, and therefore title over such land cannot be lost or
extinguished by reason of ordinary acts or omissions associated with
adverse possession. Howden J. found legislative support for this
approach in the elaborate processes designated by statute governing when
and how municipalities can sell or convey municipal property. He
concluded that, given such property is owned by municipality by way of
quality title for the public benefit, fairness and justice require that
no two people should be able to deprive the public of that benefit.

The approach developed in *Warkentin* to the "public benefit"
test subsequently was adopted in *Richard v. Niagara Falls* 2018 ONSC
7389 (Ont. S.C.J.), 4 R.P.R. (6th) 238, aff'd on other grounds, 2019 ONCA
531. In that case, a claim for adverse possession of municipal land was
not made out because the applicants failed to prove that their use of
the land was inconsistent with the city's intended use. Henderson J.,
after citing *Warkentin*, stated in *obiter*, at para. 27:

> \[I\]n order to be immune from such a claim for adverse possession, the
municipality must show that the land was purchased or dedicated for the
use of the public, *and that the land has been used by and of benefit to
the public.* \[Emphasis added.\]

In *Richard*, Henderson J. incorporated the "public benefit"
test into the third factor of the test for adverse possession (i.e.,
whether the city was effectively excluded from possession). I note that
this was an incorrect placement of the "public benefit" test, which is
instead a limitation to some claims for adverse possession for public
lands. However, I summarize here the approach taken in *Richard* to
clarify the proper characterization of the common law test. In
*Richard*, the court focused on the *de facto* situation, which in that
case was that the city intended to allow the public to make use of the
trail in question. While the court referred to the *de facto* use by the
city, as opposed to whether the city had formally designated the
disputed land as a park, Henderson J.'s formulation of the test
introduces the possibility that if a claimant can otherwise meet the
threshold for adverse possession --- and there is no evidence the
disputed municipal land is *actually* in use for the public --- an
adverse possession claim could succeed. For the reasons elaborated
below, I would not accept this characterization of the common law test.

As the appellants point out, some adverse possession claims
against municipalities involving parkland have succeeded. For example,
in *Teis v. Ancaster (Town)*, (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 216 (C.A.), this
court dismissed an appeal from a decision granting adverse possession to
private landowners over a strip of land and laneway in a public park.
The appeal was decided on the common law test of mutual mistake since
neither the private landowners nor the municipality had argued different
rules applied to the common law of adverse possession in this factual
setting. Nonetheless, Laskin J.A., in *obiter* comments, expressed "some
discomfort" over applying the ordinary rules of adverse possession to
municipal parkland, at pp. 228-229:

> Most adverse possession claims involve disputes between private property
owners. In this case, the Teises claim adverse possession of municipally
owned land. I *have some discomfort in upholding a possessory title to
land that the Town would otherwise use to extend its public park for the
benefit of its residents. Still, the Town did not suggest that
municipally owned park land cannot be extinguished by adverse possession
or even that different, more stringent requirements must be met when the
land in dispute is owned by a municipality and would be used for a
public park. This case was argued before the trial judge and in this
court on the footing that the ordinary principles of adverse possession
law applied.* The application of those principles to the
evidence and the trial judge's findings of fact justify extinguishing
the Town's title to the ploughed strip and the laneway.

> [...]

> Whether, short of statutory reform, the protection against adverse
possession afforded to municipal streets and highways should be extended
to municipal land used for public parks, I leave to a case where the
parties squarely raise the issue. \[Emphasis added.\]

In my view, *Teis* stands for the proposition that it is open to
a municipality to waive its presumptive title over parkland. While in
*Teis* this was done through agreement that the "ordinary" rules of
adverse possession applied, this waiver may also be accomplished by
acknowledging a private landowner's adverse possession and consenting to
a transfer of title (as was done with the neighbour's property in this
case), or simply by a municipality acquiescing to adverse possession,
where it has clear knowledge of its parkland property being adversely
possessed by private landowners, and agreeing to take no steps to
interfere with that adverse possession.

Aside from those exceptional circumstances, the general rule
that municipal parkland is not available for adverse possession has been
given expression through the development of the "public benefit" test as
set out above.

The appellants argued before the application judge that the
Disputed Land does not meet the public benefit standard because it
clearly was not in public use over the relevant time period (as it had
been fenced off by the previous owners of the property). The application
judge accepted this position.

On appeal, however, the appellants now argue that the "public
benefit" test has not been endorsed by an appellate court and should be
rejected entirely as inconsistent with the *RPLA*. For the reasons set
out below, I do not accept this position.

For its part, the City argues that the "public benefit" test is
good law, but that the application judge was incorrect in finding its
threshold was not met in this case. The City contends that the Disputed
Land was expropriated for public use and private landowners should not
be able to defeat that use by fencing off public land for private
benefit. According to the City, as held by the application judge,
municipal parkland of this kind should be treated as immune from adverse
possession.

I see the proper approach to adverse possession of municipal
parkland lying between the two positions of the parties in this appeal.
Under this approach, while municipal parkland is generally unavailable
for adverse possession, it may become available exceptionally where the
municipality has waived its presumptive rights over the property either
expressly or by acknowledging or acquiescing to a private landowner's
adverse possession of parkland.

#### **The Application of the Common Law of Adverse Possession to the Facts of this Case**

Applying the "public benefit" test to the record before her, the
application judge concluded that, "The City was unable to provide
evidence that the land was used by the public sometime in the 13 years
after acquisition, before it was fenced out. I find it thereby fails the
Public Benefit Test."

As elaborated above, the application judge nonetheless held that
it would be inappropriate to permit a claim in adverse possession to
succeed in circumstances where public lands are fenced off by private
individuals, as this would set "a dangerous precedent."

In my view, the application judge treated as two separate
considerations what should be seen as a single question to be addressed
by the court in applying the public benefit analysis. Where land is
acquired by a municipality and zoned as parkland or a space to be
accessible to the public, such land should be treated as presumptively
*in use* for the public benefit unless there is evidence the
municipality has acknowledged and acquiesced to its private use. It is
not enough to show that the land was rendered in fact unavailable to the
public by the actions of private landowners.

Therefore, in this case, it was not necessary that the City
demonstrate the disputed land *actually* was used specifically for a
public benefit during the period prior to it being fenced off (i.e.,
between 1958 and 1971). Rather, the sole question to be addressed was
whether the appellants, in seeking title through adverse possession,
could displace this presumption of public benefit to this municipally
owned land zoned to be used as parkland --- for example, by showing
that, while the Disputed Land was acquired for a public benefit, the
municipality, with full knowledge, acknowledged or acquiesced to its use
for the benefit of the then-owners of the appellants' property.

On this point, it is helpful to consider the City's
aforementioned consent, in 2013, to an order in favour of the easterly
neighbours of the appellants, declaring those neighbours the successful
adverse possessor of a rectangular portion of the City Lands abutting
the informal laneway. The application judge referred to this consent as
undertaken in a "cavalier" manner. The City indicated in oral
submissions that this consent may simply have been an error, based on
the mistaken belief that this parcel had been zoned residential when the
land fell under the Borough of York. No such consent or acknowledgment
by the City, however, has been made in relation to the Disputed Lands at
issue in this appeal. Nor can it be said, in light of the application
judge's factual findings, that the City acquiesced to the use of the
Disputed Land by the appellants or previous owners of this property
during the period prior to it being fenced in or afterwards. The
evidence was to the contrary, as there is nothing in the record to
indicate that the City was aware the fenced off Disputed Land was
municipal parkland. By contrast, the appellants were aware that the
fenced off land was municipal property and not part of their title,
which is why they sought to purchase the property from the City.

Generally, if a claimant acknowledges the right of the true
owner, then possession will not be adverse. "Acknowledgment of title
will thus stop the clock from running": *McClatchie v. Rideau Lakes
(Township)* 2015 ONCA 233, 53 R.P.R. (5th) 169, at para. 12, citing
*Teis*, at p. 221, and see also *1043 Bloor Inc. v. 1714104 Ontario
Inc.* 2013 ONCA 91, 114 O.R. (3d) 241, at para. 73. In this case,
however, the relevant time period was not when the appellants sought to
purchase the Disputed Land, but rather when the previous owners first
fenced it off.

Another way of looking at the question is whether the municipal
parkland was intended to be, and would have been used for the public
benefit, but for interference of the private landowners. Where, as here,
this is the case, the party bringing a claim for adverse possession
against a municipality will not have met the test to show the land has
not been used for a public benefit.

I take this formulation to be consistent with the view expressed
by the application judge in finding that, "the private landowner may not
proceed to fence off public lands and exclude the public and succeed in
a claim for adverse possession." To the extent such a scenario would not
meet the "public benefit" test as set out in *Warkentin* and *Richard*,
the test was framed too narrowly in those cases.

Therefore, I would reframe the test for adverse possession of
public land developed in cases such as *Warkentin* and *Richard* adopted
by the application judge, as follows: adverse possession claims which
are otherwise made out against municipal land will not succeed where the
land was purchased by or dedicated to the municipality for the use or
benefit of the public, and the municipality has not waived its
presumptive rights over the property, or acknowledged or acquiesced to
its use by a private landowner or landowners.

Based on this reframed test, I conclude the application judge
came to the correct result by finding adverse possession at common law
was unavailable against the municipal parkland in this case.

#### **(2) The Statutory Scheme for Adverse Possession Claims**

The appellants argue that the application judge's decision
deprives them of the protection afforded by ss. 4 and 15 of the *RPLA*
and therefore should be rejected.

Section 4 of the *RPLA* reads:

> 4\. No person shall make an entry or distress, or bring an action to
recover any land or rent, but within ten years next after the time at
which the right to make such entry or distress, or to bring such action,
first accrued to some person through whom the person making or bringing
it claims, or if the right did not accrue to any person through whom
that person claims, then within ten years next after the time at which
the right to make such entry or distress, or to bring such action, first
accrued to the person making or bringing it.

Courts have interpreted s. 4 of the *RPLA* as clarifying that
adverse possession, where established at common law, will give rise to a
limitation period of 10 years, after which the party engaging in adverse
possession will gain rights over the land.

Section 15 of the *RPLA* reads:

> 15\. At the determination of the period limited by this Act to any
person for making an entry or distress or bringing any action, the right
and title of such person to the land or rent, for the recovery whereof
such entry, distress or action, respectively, might have been made or
brought within such period, is extinguished.

Therefore, where an adverse possessor of land maintains
possession of the requisite character for a period of 10 years, s. 4 of
the *RPLA* bars the remedies of the paper title holder with respect to
that land and s. 15 of the *RPLA* extinguishes the "true owner's" title
to that land: see *Teis*, at para. 8.

Section 16 of the *RPLA* contains an exception to the
application of these provisions in favour of certain categories of
public land, including public highways, and waste or vacant land of the
Crown:

> 16\. Nothing in sections 1 to 15 applies to any waste or vacant land of
the Crown, whether surveyed or not, nor to lands included in any road
allowance heretofore or hereafter surveyed and laid out or to any lands
reserved or set apart or laid out as a public highway where the freehold
in any such road allowance or highway is vested in the Crown or in a
municipal corporation, commission or other public body, but nothing in
this section shall be deemed to affect or prejudice any right, title or
interest acquired by any person before the 13th day of June, 1922.

It is common ground among the parties that the exception in s.
16 establishing immunity from adverse possession for certain kinds of
public land does not extend to municipal parkland such as the Disputed
Land. The application judge did not refer to this provision, or to the
*RPLA* at all in her reasons. Although the *RPLA* was referred to in the
materials in the proceeding below, the legislative scheme was not the
focus of either party's submissions.

[...]

While s. 16 of the *RPLA*, first enacted in 1922, codified one
aspect of this common law rule with respect to certain exemptions from
the operation of ss. 4 and 15, in my view, nothing in the *RPLA*
suggests it was intended to preclude the further development of the
common law in public lands not of the kind categorized in that
provision.

[*Justice Sossin concluded that the RPLA did not act as a "complete code" to bar application of the common law of adverse possession.*]

For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.

## Brown J.A. (dissenting) --

Parks are good things. Every morning I look out my window and
enjoy the sight of the sun rising over the tree canopy of one of
Toronto's oldest and largest parks. When at work, I can look out my
window and see the residents of a green-space-starved, concretized,
downtown Toronto core enjoying the small, construction-free patch of
grass that remains of Osgoode Hall's West lawn. Adequate parks are vital
to maintaining one's sanity and socializing with one's neighbours in an
urban sea of steel and glass. Parks give rise to pleasant thoughts and
strong sentiments.

That said, a case such as this which involves a claim by
homeowners to adverse possession of a small patch of a municipally-owned
greenspace that has formed their backyard for decades cannot be decided
on the basis of sentiments about parkland. The appellants are entitled
to have their case decided in accordance with the governing principles
of law. Those principles are set out in statute, the *Real Property
Limitations Act*, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15 (the "*RPLA*").

The application judge did not apply those legal principles.

Instead, she stepped outside the governing statutory regime to
consider whether the City of Toronto (the "City") enjoyed the benefit of
a recent, judge-made exception to the statutory scheme, the so-called
"Public Benefit Test" asserted and articulated by the court in
*Oro-Medonte (Township) v. Warkentin*, 2013 ONSC 1416, 30 R.P.R. (5th)
44. She concluded the City did not. So, the application judge went
further. She created an even broader judge-made test that would immunize
the Disputed Land from the appellants' matured adverse possession claim.
The application judge articulated her test as follows: a "private
landowner may not proceed to fence off public lands and exclude the
public and succeed in a claim for adverse possession." Hereafter I shall
refer to the rule created by the application judge as the "Judicial
Public Lands Immunity" rule. In my view, by ignoring the *RPLA* and
creating a new judge-made rule, the application judge erred in law. She
should have granted the appellants the relief they sought; they were
entitled to it under the existing law.

My colleagues support the approach taken by the application
judge, albeit they tweak her judge-made test a bit. I respectfully but
very strongly disagree with my colleagues' decision and their analysis.
I therefore dissent.

The Disputed Land is approximately 340m2 in size: a postage
stamp when viewed in the context of the overall size of the adjacent
Étienne Brûlé Park, which winds along the Humber River from the Old Mill
to just south of Dundas Street West. But the land makes up most of the
backyard used by the appellants.

Reasonable people can disagree as to whether, as a matter of
public policy, municipal lands, including parkland, should be exposed to
adverse possession claims regardless of the strength of the claim ---
here, there is no dispute the appellants have satisfied the statutory
requirements to extinguish the City's title to the Disputed Land --- or
the size of the lands affected. However, the appellants are entitled to
have their claim decided not on the basis of what some judges might wish
the law to be, but on the basis of what the law is.

Statute--the *RPLA*--sets out the requirements for
establishing adverse possession in Ontario. Applying the law as it now
is, the appellants succeed on their claim. There is no dispute about
this fact. Yet, the application judge and my colleagues have denied the
appellants' claim on the basis that courts are entitled to look beyond
the law as it is and, instead, determine the claim based on the law as
the courts think it ought to be. They have pushed the *RPLA* aside in
order to create a legal rule, not found in the statute, about what type
of land should be immune from claims for adverse possession. In my
respectful view, their arrogation of such rule-making power constitutes
legal error.

As I understand my colleagues' reasons, the key difference that
separates our views is this: my colleagues take the view that common law
principles continue to govern the law of adverse possession; by
contrast, I read the history of that law as disclosing that a statutory
codification and reformation of the law in the area took place almost
two hundred years ago, a view that I think is supported by the decision
of the Supreme Court of Canada in *Nelson (City) v. Mowatt* 2017 SCC 8,
\[2017\] 1 S.C.R. 138, at para. 17.

As a result of those different views, my colleagues think it
open to a judge to create new legal rules regarding adverse possession,
including exempting lands from the operation of adverse possession,
notwithstanding the narrow list of exempt lands set out in *RPLA* s. 16:
waste or vacant Crown land, and road allowances and highways on Crown
and municipal land. On my part, I think the *RPLA* acts as a
comprehensive code of the principles of adverse possession subject, of
course, to proper statutory interpretation. The courts certainly
continue to possess the power to interpret and apply the provisions of
the *RPLA*. Indeed, a large body of case law has developed around the
interpretation of the statutory terms "possession" and "dispossession"
that lie at the heart of the *RPLA*. However, I do not regard proper
statutory interpretation as including a judicial power to amend the
provisions of the *RPLA*, which I think is the "on-the-ground" result of
the decisions of the application judge and my colleagues. Therein lies
our fundamental difference. And, as I shall explain in what follows,
therein lies the reason for my dissent.

I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment, and grant the
appellants the relief sought in their notice of application.

But first I must apologize to the reader for the length of this
dissent. It turned out to be much longer than I had anticipated. In my
defence, I think this appeal raises an issue of fundamental importance.
Not whether the appellants are entitled to a declaration of possessory
title over the Disputed Land--of course they are. Everyone
acknowledges the appellants have met the statutory requirements for such
a declaration. But while it is important that the appellants should
receive their legal due, of greater importance is the way in which the
courts in this case have denied the appellants their legal due. That
judicial denial raises an issue that transcends the interests of the
parties to this appeal.

Courts have become very powerful in this country. Yet, there is
little that holds judges accountable for the exercise of their powers.
The other branches of government--the legislatures and the executives--are accountable to the people for their decisions through various
mechanisms, including the review of their conduct by the courts. By
contrast, no one supervises the courts and the judges who populate them.
(Whether that is a good thing or bad thing, I leave for others to debate
in other forums.)

For the purposes of this case, the point I wish to make is this:
for courts to play a lawful and legitimate role in a democracy, their
lack of accountability mandates that judges exercise their powers with
restraint and within proper bounds. In my view, and with all due respect
to the application judge and my colleagues, that has not happened in
this case.
