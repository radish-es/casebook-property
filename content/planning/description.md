The purpose of this casebook is to teach 1L law students in Canada about (1) the historical formations of Canadian lawscapes and (2) the contemporary relevance of those formations to addressing disputes about land relations. 

Lawscapes are a particular form of landscape--socio-ecological structures of land relations, or spaces of natural and cultural interaction (Ellen N Chappell, John R Parkins and Kate Sherren, “Climax Thinking, Place Attachment, and Utilitarian Landscapes: Implications for Wind Energy Development” (2020) 199 Landscape and Urban Planning 103802 at 1)

"Nicole Graham’s concept of the lawscape nicely channels this critique into the context of law by challenging the disconnect between property law’s apparently insubstantial and abstract nature and “the physical materiality of place.” (Nicole Graham, Lawscape: Property, Environment, Law (Abingdon: Routledge, 2011). C.f., Kirstin Anker, “We the Nomads: Review of Nicole Graham, Lawscape: Property, Environment, Law” 7:2 McGill International Journal of Sustainable Development Law and Policy 233.)

For socio-ecological approaches see: Elinor Ostrom, “A General Framework for Analyzing Sustainability of Social-ecological Systems” (2009) 325:5939 Science 419; Michael D McGinnis and Elinor Ostrom, “Social-ecological System Framework: Initial Changes and Continuing Challenges” (2014) 19:2 Ecology and Society.

The design of this casebook resists the temptation of thinking about law (or certain systems of law) as "evolutionary" toward some social optimum -- see Kate Sherren's concept of "landscapes on the edge".
