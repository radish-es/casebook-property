This text develops a new approach to the conventional first-year Property Law course that is still taught in most Canadian law schools. It builds  on Nicole Graham's concept of "lawscapes" as the central means to connect the material context of particular physical landscapes, as places, with their social and institutional dimensions:[@graham2010lawscape, 5]

> In effect, what we see in a landscape is not a detached and separated physical realm, 'the land', but ourselves, our practices and our law -- a lawscape.

<!--NB: Land-based education-->

From this somewhat unconventional starting point, the text has the following goals:

- to develop learners' understandings of how Canadian lawscapes have been produced historically as a series of place-based, intercultural encounters that challenge longstanding narratives about both the universalism of Anglo-Canadian law, about the "private" nature of property, and about the dynamics of legal "evolution";

- to make the case that understanding the historical and place-based formation of lawscapes as a contemporary and ongoing relevance for addressing disputes and disagreements around land relations; 

- to advance a methodological, pedagogical and technological framework through which teachers can adapt the study of lawscapes in  their particular places in practice;


Ultimately, the premise of this course is that understanding lawscapes is really a process of understanding how "Canada" was and is being formed or created. This question about nation-creation and nation-building is too often hidden in conventional property law courses.  

## Two Hybrids: Land-Law, Law-Technology

- "Lawscapes" as a way of combining the abstract qualities of law with the physical realities of land;
- "Techlawlogy" as a way of using digital technologies to more effectively study law 




Lawscapes are a particular form of landscape--socio-ecological structures of land relations, or spaces of natural and cultural interaction (Ellen N Chappell, John R Parkins and Kate Sherren, “Climax Thinking, Place Attachment, and Utilitarian Landscapes: Implications for Wind Energy Development” (2020) 199 Landscape and Urban Planning 103802 at 1)

"Nicole Graham’s concept of the lawscape nicely channels this critique into the context of law by challenging the disconnect between property law’s apparently insubstantial and abstract nature and “the physical materiality of place.” (Nicole Graham, Lawscape: Property, Environment, Law (Abingdon: Routledge, 2011). C.f., Kirstin Anker, “We the Nomads: Review of Nicole Graham, Lawscape: Property, Environment, Law” 7:2 McGill International Journal of Sustainable Development Law and Policy 233.)

For socio-ecological approaches see: Elinor Ostrom, “A General Framework for Analyzing Sustainability of Social-ecological Systems” (2009) 325:5939 Science 419; Michael D McGinnis and Elinor Ostrom, “Social-ecological System Framework: Initial Changes and Continuing Challenges” (2014) 19:2 Ecology and Society.

The design of this casebook resists the temptation of thinking about law (or certain systems of law) as "evolutionary" toward some social optimum -- see Kate Sherren's concept of "landscapes on the edge". 



### Place

Because this casebook is situated on the idea of landscapes, it is also situated on a particular place: Mi'kma'ki / Atlantic Canada.
