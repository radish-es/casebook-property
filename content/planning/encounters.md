Idea is to redesign the content around a series of "encounters" and to move further away from doctrinal focus each week. This emphasis on encounters tracks the historiographical approach charted by Ned Blackhawk in "rediscovering" American history [@blackhawk2023rediscovery]. "Rediscovery" also puts a subversive reinterpretation on the doctrine of discovery and terra nullius and locates this project at the heart of the coruse.


For example, the settlement of Halifax at K'jipuktuk was a watershed in inter-national relations between the Mi'kmaq, British and French. For the British, this was a settlement of a different kind: focused not on resource extraction or trade, but exclusively on establishing a military outpost to put Britain "on the map" as it were [@lennox2017homelands, 125-26]

- Halifax settlement was preceded by disease, which dramatically reduced the capacity of Mi'kmaq to resist British settlement (McDonald)[x-devonthink-item://F640E45B-42CC-4825-8B45-4B333A4B18BE]

- Halifax's founding the Cornwallis' infamous bounty on the Mi'kmaq also marked a significant shift toward violence 


Examples of encounters:

- Mi'kmaw law (netuklimk) and possession (e.g. hunting)
- Settlement of Halifax in between Peace and Friendship Treaties, RP 1763
- Norman Conquest and William the Conqueror? (doctrine of tenure)
- African Nova-Scotian (Slavery? Africville?)
     - *Imperial Act* (1790), allowing for the duty-free import of Black persons, household furniture, utensils of husbandry, or clothing. 
     - *DeLancey v Woodin*, SCNS (1803)
- Japanese-Canadian internment
- Expropriation / McLaren v Caldwell?? (What is the encounter here?)
- St. Catherines Milling, treaty and land cession? Confederation and division of powers over property? 
- Right to shelter and encounters in public parks 
- Racially restrictive covenants; affordable housing
