SMART course objectives: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART)

## Week 1: Intro

- Tell students that they are specifically not being evaluated on this material
- Have a class discussion about who read the material, why and why not, and then a substantive discussion that is intended to be "pressure free"

## Week 2: 

Week2 centres on the question, "who owns the fox?" In order to answer that question, we need to answer the question, "what are the relevant legal principles or rules?" One answer to that question is that dominium and possession-as-property was a well-grounded British legal concept that was forced onto British North American and has become the dominant set of rules for determining ownership of wild animals. An alternative answer is more complicated: rules for wild and domestic animals were produced and negotiated as part of early colonial encounters, drawing out the contingency and ambiguity of common law concepts like "possession". This was particularly important in the early colonial period before settler colonialism specifically became more widespread. 

### Big objectives

- Where does Canadian land law come from? Describe and contrast the "displacement" idea of Canadian land law with the "encounters" idea of Canadian land law 

### Little objectives

- Explain Locke's theory of possession as the basis of property
- Introduce the contingency of property in wild animals and contrast with domestic animals to distinguish possession from property
- Apply Locke's theory to the rule of capture (Pierson) and introduce complications to the concept of dominium/control
- Principles of treaty interpretation and treaty rights 
- Apply concept of relative possession (Armourie)?
