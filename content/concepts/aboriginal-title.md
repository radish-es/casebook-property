### Four Dimensions of the Aboriginal Title Doctrine

In our study of the materials this week, we will aim to address four core dimensions of the Aboriginal title doctrine:

1. Proof of Aboriginal title

2. Nature/content and source of Aboriginal title

3. Infringement of Aboriginal title 

4. Duty to consult

### Contemporary Doctrine

This week, we complete our study of Indigenous land rights, with a focus on the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title. We have traced the evolution of that doctrine from the Royal Proclamation in 1763, through *St. Catherine's Milling* in the late nineteenth century and *Calder* and *Guerin* in the late twentieth century. The contemporary path of the Aboriginal title doctrine since those cases has been charted through a combination of constitutional reform, litigation in the courts, and negotiation between Indigenous nations and the Crown. 

The Supreme Court of Canada's landmark ruling in *Delgamuukw* in 1997—building on the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and treaty rights in section 35 of the *Constitution Act, 1982*—laid much of the jurisprudential groundwork for the contemporary doctrine. But it was not until several years later, with the Court's decision in *Tsilhqot'in*, that a claim for recognition of Aboriginal title was successfully made out. In the intervening years, the Supreme Court also established the basis for the Crown's constitutional duty to consult with Indigenous communities where state action was contemplated that might infringe on Aboriginal title before it was proven in court.

The contemporary doctrine of common law Aboriginal title is complex—made even more so by the web of legal and political relationships that form the important context in which critical issues around the doctrine must be addressed. Our goal this week is the understand the key elements of this doctrine that build on material we have developed through our course and to identify unanswered questions for this area of law going forward.

The contemporary doctrine of Aboriginal title is complex and contains several elements that we have not yet encountered in our historical study of this area of law. Below is a map of the caselaw materials this week to help you develop your understanding of the doctrine with an eye toward addressing this week's case study.

### Doctrinal Map to Aboriginal Title

### Step 1: Background

First, start by establishing in your own mind the context of the two leading cases on Aboriginal title. Read [Delgamuukw, paras 1-8](#Delgamuukw) and [Tsilhqot'in, paras 1-24](#Tsilhqot'in) for background on the parties and a brief review of the relevant caselaw. 

### Step 2: Test for Proof of Title

At this step, you are addressing the question of what a plaintiff First Nation needs to demonstrate in order to successfully make out a claim for recognition of Aboriginal title to a particular territory. Read [Delgamuukw, paras 47-61](#delg-proof) and [Tsilhqot'in, paras 25-67](#tsil-proof), watch the mini-lecture following these paragraphs, then review Question 1 of the case study. 

### Step 3: Content and Source of Title

At this step, you are addressing the question of what rights are recognized on the part of a plaintiff First Nation if they are successful in making out their claim at Step 2. The step answers the question (which we have encountered several times before in the course): "What *is* Aboriginal title, from the common law's perspective?" Read [Delgamuukw, paras 10-45](#delg-content) and [Tsilhqot'in, paras 68-77](#tsil-content), watch the mini-lecture following these paragraphs, then review Question 2 of the case study.

### Step 4: Infringement of Title

Finally, once Aboriginal title has been proven and its content and source defined, the courts have left open the possibility that the Crown can justifiably infringe upon the rights associated with that title. What is the test and rationale for infringement? Read [Tsilhqot'in, paras 78-89](#tsil-infringe), watch the mini-lecture following these paragraphs, then review Question 3 of the case study.
