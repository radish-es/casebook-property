#### Introduction ####

Last week, we looked at the privileged place of *possession* in common law thinking about property. Stretching back to the writings of John Locke on liberal political theory, we saw that labour and possession have long provided an answer to the question of where property rights come from. *Possession*, in other words, can serve as the basis for *title*, the legal recognition of ownership. We also explored how possession, for all its seeming simplicity, can be a very difficult legal concept to interpret and apply in practice.

We now turn to the issue of *Aboriginal title* to further explore these topics of possession and title in the style of classical common law thought. Here, "Aboriginal title" refers to the common law doctrine that affords recognition to the property rights of Indigenous nations in land, based on their possession or occupancy of those lands prior to colonial settlement. For example, Mi'kmaw people have lived on and held established relationships with the lands in Mi'kmak'i for thousands of years. They did so long before colonial settlement and have never entered into a treaties "ceding" those lands to a colonial government. A Mi'kmaw community might, therefore, bring a case in the Canadian courts claiming recognition of their rights to their territorial lands. The legal framework for such cases has, to date, been developed from the concept of common law Aboriginal title and it is this doctrine we will start to analyze this week.

However, before pursuing a better understanding of Aboriginal title and its historical development, it is important to be cautious about *subsuming* all relevant legal principles and legal systems within the common law doctrine. Mi'kmaw people not only occupied Mi'kma'ki long before colonization, they also governed their relationships with the land according to Mi'kmaw law. They continue to do so. Nevertheless, the Mi'kmaw Nation and other Indigenous nations are required, under Canadian law, to seek inter-legal recognition of their rights exclusively within the Canadian courts. Why--especially in context of the Peace and Friendship Treaties--should this be the case? 

We might interpret our focus in the course this week as addressing the "internal" perspective of the common law. What *is* the nature and source of Aboriginal title according to the common law's own logic? Going further to address the broader dynamic of subsummation requires an "external" perspective: from the standpoint of a relationship between nations that co-exist with one another, whose system(s) of law can legitimately provide an answer to questions about the content and source of Indigenous land rights? This external perspective is related to issues of sovereignty (how and when law-making authority is asserted as between nations) and to issues about how to understand the role of relationships, obligations and world views in a multi-juridical context. 

{{< figure src="/media/rp1763.jpg" caption="Royal Proclamation, 1763." >}}

We begin with the *Royal Proclamation of 1763*—a document in which King George III of England set out the terms of colonial settlement in British North America after the Seven Years War. In doing so, the British Crown articulated its contemporary interpretation of Aboriginal title and laid the groundwork for subsequent development of that doctrine in the common law courts. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 includes several key ideas that come to play a pivotal role in future cases. Among these are the assertion or assumption of sovereignty in the British Crown, the acknowledgement of Indigenous land rights in land "not having been ceded to or purchased", and a direct prohibition on the private sale and purchase of Indigenous land rights (otherwise referred to as a "restraint on alienation" via the doctrine of preemption). 

This week's materials are entitled "Possession II", but in fact the central lesson this week is about how the doctrine of Aboriginal title came to undermine Indigenous nations' own relationships to land while at the same time denying their "possession" of their territories as a basis for holding recognized property rights. When we read Locke's *Second Treatise* last week, we observed how his labour theory of property acknowledged the possibility of Indigenous peoples' property rights through possession (at least, with respect to wild animals or other "natural resources"), while simultaneously denying the relevance of Indigenous legal orders or ways of life for establishing such entitlements. Pay close attention to the role of that same reasoning in the materials you will read this week. 

These issues relate directly to the Royal Proclamation, 1763, which we turn to next. A crucial question for the courts in the *St. Catherine's Milling* case, below, and in subsequent decisions is about the nature and source of Aboriginal title. Was the Royal Proclamation to be understood as the *source* of Aboriginal title, or as a recognition of pre-existing rights? If the latter, where else might these rights find their source?

### Aboriginal Title at the End of the 19th Century ###

At this point, you have read three different judgements in the *St. Catherine's Milling* case: the judgement at trial by Chancellor Boyd, Justice Strong's dissent at the Supreme Court of Canada, and Lord Watson's final decision for the Privy Council. As you try to make sense of the different interpretations and rationales offered by the judges with respect to common law Aboriginal title, consider their different answers to the following questions:

- What is the *source* of the rights that are encompassed by Aboriginal title? Where do these rights come from?

- What is the *nature* or *content* of Aboriginal title? Are the rights encompassed by Aboriginal title the same as or different from the property rights we have examined so far in the course?

### Four Dimensions of the Aboriginal Title Doctrine

In our study of the materials this week, we will aim to address four core dimensions of the Aboriginal title doctrine:

1. Proof of Aboriginal title

2. Nature/content and source of Aboriginal title

3. Infringement of Aboriginal title 

4. Duty to consult

Please start by watching the mini-lecture review below, which will revisit and recap the major points on Aboriginal title that we have covered in our historical study so far.

### Modern Doctrine (Calder and Guerin) ###

Later this term we will turn to the contemporary doctrine of Aboriginal title as developed in a series of recent cases by the Supreme Court of Canada. 

Together, the two cases you encountered this week—*Calder* in 1973 and *Guerin* in 1984—represented something of a turning point in common law Aboriginal title, in which the Supreme Court began to depart in some significant ways from the course charted by the Privy Council in *St. Catherine's Milling*. The mini-lecture below identifies some of these departure points, as well as those aspects of common law Aboriginal title that remained unchanged and continued to be grounded in the doctrine of discovery. These key points will serve as an introduction to the material Aboriginal title we will continue to study this term.

### Contemporary Doctrine ###

This week, we complete our study of Indigenous land rights, with a focus on the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title. We have traced the evolution of that doctrine from the Royal Proclamation in 1763, through *St. Catherine's Milling* in the late nineteenth century and *Calder* and *Guerin* in the late twentieth century. The contemporary path of the Aboriginal title doctrine since those cases has been charted through a combination of constitutional reform, litigation in the courts, and negotiation between Indigenous nations and the Crown. 

The Supreme Court of Canada's landmark ruling in *Delgamuukw* in 1997—building on the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and treaty rights in section 35 of the *Constitution Act, 1982*—laid much of the jurisprudential groundwork for the contemporary doctrine. But it was not until several years later, with the Court's decision in *Tsilhqot'in*, that a claim for recognition of Aboriginal title was successfully made out. In the intervening years, the Supreme Court also established the basis for the Crown's constitutional duty to consult with Indigenous communities where state action was contemplated that might infringe on Aboriginal title before it was proven in court.

The contemporary doctrine of common law Aboriginal title is complex—made even more so by the web of legal and political relationships that form the important context in which critical issues around the doctrine must be addressed. Our goal this week is the understand the key elements of this doctrine that build on material we have developed through our course and to identify unanswered questions for this area of law going forward.

The contemporary doctrine of Aboriginal title is complex and contains several elements that we have not yet encountered in our historical study of this area of law. Below is a map of the caselaw materials this week to help you develop your understanding of the doctrine with an eye toward addressing this week's case study.

### Doctrinal Map to Aboriginal Title

### Step 1: Background

First, start by establishing in your own mind the context of the two leading cases on Aboriginal title. Read [Delgamuukw, paras 1-8](#Delgamuukw) and [Tsilhqot'in, paras 1-24](#Tsilhqot'in) for background on the parties and a brief review of the relevant caselaw. 

### Step 2: Test for Proof of Title

At this step, you are addressing the question of what a plaintiff First Nation needs to demonstrate in order to successfully make out a claim for recognition of Aboriginal title to a particular territory. Read [Delgamuukw, paras 47-61](#delg-proof) and [Tsilhqot'in, paras 25-67](#tsil-proof), watch the mini-lecture following these paragraphs, then review Question 1 of the case study. 

### Step 3: Content and Source of Title

At this step, you are addressing the question of what rights are recognized on the part of a plaintiff First Nation if they are successful in making out their claim at Step 2. The step answers the question (which we have encountered several times before in the course): "What *is* Aboriginal title, from the common law's perspective?" Read [Delgamuukw, paras 10-45](#delg-content) and [Tsilhqot'in, paras 68-77](#tsil-content), watch the mini-lecture following these paragraphs, then review Question 2 of the case study.

### Step 4: Infringement of Title

Finally, once Aboriginal title has been proven and its content and source defined, the courts have left open the possibility that the Crown can justifiably infringe upon the rights associated with that title. What is the test and rationale for infringement? Read [Tsilhqot'in, paras 78-89](#tsil-infringe), watch the mini-lecture following these paragraphs, then review Question 3 of the case study.
