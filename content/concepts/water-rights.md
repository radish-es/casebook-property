#### Introduction

Last week, we saw that remedies in nuisance are one legal tool used by property owners—with mixed success—to stop their neighbours from adversely affecting use and enjoyment of the owner's land. Nuisance, in other words, is one legal means to *exclude* others from doing something that limits owners' freedom related to property. This means of exclusion, however, unavoidably limits the freedom of others to use their land as they choose. In these situations, the courts must choose whose rights should win out. In doing so, they struggle to address the fundamental dilemma of conflicting freedoms inherent in legal liberalism.  

Other cases—like the one we will study this week—raise a different aspect of the right to exclude. These cases concern the legal protections afforded to landowners in excluding the state itself from various types of "infringements" on an owner's property. They engage the state's power of *expropriation* (governmental power to take away property rights), which in some contexts is called the power of *eminent domain*.  

In the most dramatic cases, the state exercises its expropriation power to take private title to land (for example, to build a highway or an airport). But there are many other scenarios in which the state leaves title in the hands of the landowner but "takes" one or more sticks in the ownership bundle by way of regulation or other legislative act. In their broadest sense, such "regulatory takings" or "constructive expropriations" are potentially ubiquitous, ranging from environmental regulations to building codes and zoning bylaws. Similar to claims in nuisance, these state activities have sometimes been cast as violations of claimant landowners' traditional rights of property.

A key legal issue is to what extent landowners in Canada can exclude governments from expropriating or otherwise regulating their property rights in the absence of compensation. Unlike the United States and several modern constitutional democracies, Canada lacks any constitutional protections for private property against state attempts to limit or take away those rights. Lacking such explicit protections, it has generally necessary for claimants to find other legal routes to compel compensation for expropriation of property. 

What protections do exist mainly take the form of provincial expropriation statutes. These statutes do not prevent government from expropriating property *per se*, but they do impose certain restrictions on this activity, such as that it must be undertaken for a public purpose and that adequate compensation to landowners must be paid. Such compensation is clearly required when title is taken away by the state. Much less clear is to what extent governments in Canada are responsible for compensating landowners for regulatory activity that "takes" one or more sticks in the bundle. As the United States Supreme Court observed in *Pennsylvania Coal Co. v Mahon*, "[g]overnment hardly could go on if, to some extent, values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law."

A crucial moment in the history of Anglo-Canadian legal thinking on issues of expropriation surfaced around a dispute over water rights in Ontario toward the end of the nineteenth century. The dispute was between the lumbering operations of one Peter McLaren and one Boyd Caldwell. Before delving into that controversy further, we will begin with a brief primer on common law water rights, which differ in several important ways from property in land.

Common law water rights are a complex topic in their own right and tend to vary by province — we will only skim the surface here. In order to understand the setting for *McLaren v Caldwell*, below, a few basic concepts applicable to rivers in Ontario are relevant.

A ***riparian owner*** is the owner of land bounding upon a river or other watercourse. The traditional presumption of English common law is that a riparian owner owns the bed of a ***non-navigable*** river or stream to the centre of the watercourse: *ad medium filum aquae*. Consequently, a riparian owner who holds land on both sides of a river considered "non-navigable" owns the entire riverbed and has exclusive rights to the river's use . 

The situation is different with respect to ***navigable*** waters. If a river is navigable "in fact", then there exists a public right of navigation in that river (i.e. a right to travel over it). It is, in other words, in the nature of a public highway. Title to the beds of these rivers is vested in the Crown. 

The legal definition of what makes a river navigable or not can involve a fair degree of complexity and is based heavily on the facts. For our purposes, suffice to say that, in making this determination, courts will consider whether the river is navigable along its entire length—meaning that it may be deemed navigable even if points along its length (like rapids or falls) are impossible to navigate.[^nikal1996]

Over the course of the nineteenth century, access to waterways in Upper Canada and elsewhere in the country became an integral part of the lumber industry and a primary means to bring timber from logging operations to sawmills and other points of market. From one perspective, these waterways were akin to other types of public infrastructure (like roads and railways) necessary for rapidly expanding natural resource extraction and, eventually,  industrialization. In 1847, legislation was passed to help ensure access to waterways in Upper Canada by lumber workers. The legislation stated that:[^vict1849]

> All persons may float saw logs and other timber, rafts and craft down all streams in Upper Canada during the spring, summer, and autumn freshets, and no person shall, by felling trees or placing any other obstruction in or across any such stream prevent the passage thereof.

(Here, the term "freshets" refers to the flood of a river or stream due to heavy rain or melted snow). 

A question of interpretation surrounding this provision made its way before the courts in Upper Canada in a case called *Boale v Dickson*, decided in 1863. In *Boale*, the court held that the provision above applied only to watercourses that allowed timber to be floated down them "in their natural state…without improvements". Crucially, this meant that the legislation was found not apply to non-navigable rivers where riparian owners had made them navigable exclusively by installing their own improvements.

A few decades later, after the provision above was reenacted by the Province of Ontario, the decision in *Boale v Dickson* was challenged when Boyd Caldwell & Son sought to float logs down waterways belonging to the lumber merchant Peter McLaren—waterways which McLaren had made navigable only by investing heavily in costly improvements. 

In 1880, McLaren persuaded the Ontario Court of Chancery to grant an injunction--based on the ruling in  *Boale*--restraining Caldwell from using the rivers where McLaren had made improvements. Following Caldwell's appeal of the decision, the Ontario Court of Appeal overruled *Boale* and overturned the injunction. Eventually, this decision by Ontario Court of Appeal interpreting the 1847 Act was overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada but ultimately upheld by the Privy Council.

Meanwhile, the provincial legislature in Ontario attempted to intervene in the dispute between McLaren and Caldwell by enacting legislation in 1881 entitled *An Act for Protecting the Public Interest in Rivers, Streams and Creeks* (the *Rivers and Streams Act*). This new legislation attempted to clarify--*contra Boale*--that parties in Caldwell's position did indeed have the right to use rivers like McLaren's and their associated improvements, even if they were non-navigable to begin with. 

Following the enactment of the *Rivers and Streams Act* in 1881, McLaren successfully petitioned the federal government to take the extraordinary step of unilaterally disallowing the new legislation on the basis that it unduly interfered with McLaren's property rights. In the two years following, the *Rivers and Streams Act* was twice reintroduced by the province, with the federal government disallowing the legislation each time. The Act finally passed, without disallowance, in 1884. 

At the heart of this dispute was the issue of how Ontario's attempts to facilitate transportation in the lumber industry through the modification of traditional rights to property in watercourses ought to be interpreted in law. Should provincial limitations on McLaren's rights to exclude others from using the river be viewed by the courts as an expropriation? If so, what are the legal consequences of such an interpretation?

Below are excerpts from the judgements of the Ontario Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada in *McLaren v Caldwell*, the *Rivers and Streams Act*, and Parliamentary debates surrounding federal disallowance of the legislation. As in previous weeks, we are interested in how the features of the classical style of common law thought are influencing the decisions in these cases--here, decisions taken in both the judicial and political spheres.
