In Weeks 4 and 5, we looked at the essential role that possession plays in common law thinking about property. We now turn to the doctrine of Aboriginal title and examine how the common law began to interpret Indigenous land rights in the classical style.

In relationship to the other material we have covered so far in Unit 2 of the course, consider the following two problems regarding Indigenous land rights—set in the context of Mi'kmaw land rights and laws. We will aim to address both of these problems this week and next:

### Two Critical Problems

- Mi'kmaw people have lived on and held established relationships with the lands that now comprise Eastern Canada for thousands of years. They did so long before colonial settlement. Because Mi'kma'ki is unceded territory, if we apply the common law principles of first possession we have learned about so far, the Mi'kmaq continue to hold title. Yet that title was effectively denied by the common law courts in the classical period. Why?

- Mi'kmaw people not only occupied Mi'kma'ki long before colonization, they also governed their relationships with the land according to Mi'kmaw law. They continue to do so. Why should Anglo-Canadian law be the system (or the only system) that determines questions of possession, title and other legal dimensions of lands governance, as the common law courts have long assumed?

We might think of the first problem above as addressing the "internal" perspective of the common law. What *is* Aboriginal title according to the common law's own logic? The second problem requires an "external" perspective. From the standpoint of a relationship between nations that co-exist with one another, whose system of law can legitimately provide an answer the first problem about the content of Indigenous land rights? This second problem rests on the issue of *sovereignty*, i.e. how and when law-making authority is asserted as between nations. 

We will take the first of these problems as our starting point. We begin with the *Royal Proclamation of 1763*—a document in which King George III of England set out the terms of colonial settlement in British North America after the Seven Years War. In doing so, the British Crown articulated its contemporary interpretation of Aboriginal title and laid the groundwork for subsequent development of that doctrine in the common law courts.

The Royal Proclamation of 1763 includes several key ideas that come to play a pivotal role in future cases. Among these are the assertion or assumption of sovereignty in the British Crown, the acknowledgement of Indigenous land rights in land "not having been ceded to or purchased", and a direct prohibition on the private sale and purchase of Indigenous land rights (otherwise referred to as a "restraint on alienation"). 

While the Proclamation uses words and phrases like "Possession", "for the use of" and "lands reserved", it is important to place these terms in context of actual practices and the way the were used at the time. This approach is a central feature of Justice Strong's judgement in *St. Catherine's Milling*, below.
