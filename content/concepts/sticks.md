When trying to explain the common law's particular (and sometimes idiosyncratic) understanding of "ownership", lawyers and judges frequently invoke the "bundle of sticks" metaphor—as in, "ownership is like a bundle of sticks"—the "sticks" being the various property rights that make up the ownership "bundle". 

The idea behind the metaphor is that ownership is not really a uniform collection of rights that one either has (ownership) or does not (no ownership). Instead, ownership is a malleable legal concept, difficult to pin down to any particular arrangement or bundle. One landowner might have an unrestricted right to use their land in any way they like, while another might have certain use rights taken out of their ownership bundle—say, by public land use regulations restricting what they can build. We would likely call both an "owner", even though they hold different sets of legal entitlements. 

This "bundle" view of property of course raises the question: if stick after stick is eliminated from the ownership bundle, at what point does one cease to become an "owner" at all (recall that this was one of the fundamental disagreements between the judges in *Moore*)?
