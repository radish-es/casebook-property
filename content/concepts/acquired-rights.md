#### Introduction ####

This week we continue our study of issues related to land use control from the perspective of the modern style. Our topic this week is the **acquired rights** of landowners under changing land use planning and zoning regimes.

- Acquired rights are property rights "acquired" by landowners through **actual use** of their land.

- Acquired rights are also called **non-conforming uses** in common law jurisdictions (or more colloquially, "grandfathered uses").

**Why it matters**: Acquired rights give landowners the right to continue pre-existing uses even when land use regulations change. They provide powerful protections for traditional property rights or big impediments to comprehensive planning and development (depending on your perspective).

**Modernizing nuisance**: like *de facto* expropriation, the doctrine of acquired rights gained attention as local and provincial land use laws supplanted nuisance as the main legal tools to address land use disputes.

- Back in Week 7 we looked at remedies in nuisance as a response to the basic liberal dilemma: neighbouring landowners each want full freedom of property, but the unrestricted freedom of one is impossible without limiting the other.

- At the time of *Canadian Copper Co.* and *Canadian Paper Co.*, nuisance claims were the main legal tool for regulating land use conflicts.

- But as these conflicts became more complex and widespread--with growing industrialization and urbanization--local planning regimes were enacted to separate clashing uses by confining them to different **zones** (residential uses over here, industrial uses over there). 

**Link to last week**: acquired rights help to soften the stringency of Canadian law on *de facto* expropriation.

- We saw in *Mariner* that the emerging test for *de facto* expropriation was hard for landowners to meet.

- Per Justice Binnie in  *Saint-Romuald (City) v Olivier*, below:  "[t]o counter the concern about confiscation without compensation, lawful existing uses came to be protected under the concept of acquired rights."

- More broadly, acquired rights help to shield landowners from some of dynamic uncertainties of modern planning.

Acquired rights were initially an invention of the courts, though today they are often enshrined in local legislation.

#### Source of Acquired Rights ####

The first question in acquired rights cases is always: **did the landowner acquire any durable use rights in the first place?**

- This is a question about where acquired rights come from, i.e. their source.

**Why we're reading it**: The *City of Toronto* case below establishes the basic common law principle about the source of acquired rights. 

- Key to understanding this case is getting clear on the respective roles of the **city bylaw** and the **landowner's actual use** of the land.

#### Extinguishment ####

Just as it is possible to gain acquired rights through actual use of the land, it is also possible to **lose those rights through non-use**. 

- In *Saint-Romuald*, the court notes that under Quebec legislation, a "municipality may not...order the cessation of [legal non-conforming uses] unless they have been abandoned or interrupted for 'a reasonable period' no shorter than six months." 

In Nova Scotia, the *Municipal Government Act*, SNS 1998, c 18, s 240 governs the extinguishment of acquired rights for most municipalities:

> **Nonconforming use of land**

> **240** A nonconforming use of land may not be

>> (a) extended beyond the limits that the use legally occupies;
>>
>> (b) changed to any other use except a use permitted in the zone; and
>>
>> (c) recommenced, if discontinued for a continuous period of six months.

Is there a good reason to trigger the extinguishment of non-conforming uses in this way?

#### Scope ####

A second question that often arises in acquired rights cases is: **what is the *scope* of the rights acquired?**

- This question assumes that some rights have been acquired based on pre-existing use of the land, while recognizing that this use might change and evolve over time.

- Too narrow an answer might render acquired rights ineffective to their purpose, but too broad an answer could effectively give landowners free reign to flout planning laws.

**Why we're reading it**: The Supreme Court's decision in *Saint-Romuald (City)v Olivier* sets out a legal framework for defining the scope of acquired rights. 

- Both Justice Binnie and Gonthier agree that the "categorical approach" to acquired rights should be rejected but disagree on how the scope of the respondent's rights should be defined in this case.

- To what extent is the disagreement between the judges over the relevance of "personal value judgments" and "the values of society" framed by the modern style of common law thought?
