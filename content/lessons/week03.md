## Review and a Brief Intro to Feudal Land Tenure

With the coming long weekend, we have only one scheduled class meeting this week. So instead of launching into new material, we will focus on two tasks:

1. Please review the [Week 2 problem]({{< ref "problems/wowkwis" >}}) again, along with your notes and the slides from class. Then, using the [Answer Framework]({{< ref "problems/wowkwis#answer-framework" >}}) I have added to the problem page, try to plan and write out your own answer to the problem in narrative form. Bring your answers with you to class and we will discuss them together.

2. In preparation for the following week's materials and problem, please read [this short excerpt on feudal land tenure]({{< ref "casebook/title/tenure" >}}). I will deliver a brief lecture in class to introduce the relevant concepts and tee up the issues we will study next week.
