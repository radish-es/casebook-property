We will use our time in class to do a help identify key gaps in your knowledge and understanding in the course this term, with an emphasis on the weeks since our last review. To that end, I have provided a list of "rapid review" questions for you to read and consider. I don’t suggest that you address them all in full detail. Instead, read each and consider your answer for no more than a few minutes. You can come back to these questions in more detail as part of your exam preparation--their purpose at this point is only to provide a check on what you've learned so far and to help you to discover where you can most effectively focus your studying.
