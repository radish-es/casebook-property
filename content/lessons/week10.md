This week we return, in part, to where we started our study of property law this year: the law of possession. Recall that John Locke's labour theory of possession and property has been a significant influence on common law principles in this area. We will start by reading a contemporary case apply the "rule of capture" in Major League Baseball, and then extend the insights we gain around possession to the developing Canadian law on adverse possession. 

Our problem this week is situated in the context of municipal parkland and will extend into next week's topic address the right to shelter in public spaces.
