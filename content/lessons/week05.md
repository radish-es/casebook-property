objectives:
  - objective: Discuss claims in nuisance one means of property holders exercising their right to exclude.    
  - objective: Identify and describe the test for determining the appropriate remedy in nuisance, while critically assessing whether or not this test helps us to consistently resolve a heavily contested legal issue. 

description: As one of several possible means by which owners exercise their right to exclude others from their land, this week we examine the role of claims in nuisance and the challenging question of appropriate remedies.

## A Turn to Governance

Over the past few weeks we have been focused on questions about recognizing relationships to land and about the central role of two concepts: possession and title. We now turn to a second group of topics that address how--once possession and title receive recognition in law--conflicting uses of land are governed as a matter of property. 

From a historical perspective, as settler colonialism advanced based on law's denial of Indigenous rights and sovereignty (our topic last week), post-Confederation nationalism sought to establish the economic foundation of this new country by continuing to pursue natural resource extraction and, increasingly, to advance industrialization. Central to this economic project were legal tools that developed to address the most significant "externalities" of these activities--namely, the inevitable land use conflicts arising from large-scale environmental pollution and from the growing concentration of people living in close proximity to one another, especially in burgeoning urban centres like Toronto, Montreal and Halifax. We will examine two of these important legal tools this week: (1) remedies available in the law of nuisance and (2) the rise of restrictive covenants annexed to land. While existing in different doctrinal areas, it is important to see both of these as key private-law technologies for regulating land uses in an era before the widespread application of public land use controls more familiar today. 

## Nuisance Law in an Industrializing Canada

Widespread industrialization came somewhat late in Canada compared to England and the United States, where nuisance law was earlier addressed in the common law courts as a potential impediment to economic "progress". As Jennifer Nedelsky explains:[^nedelsky1981]

> By the late nineteenth century, industrialization and urbanization were changing the shape of Canadian society: between 1880 and 1920 the population doubled from 3,689,257 to 8,788,483; 74.35 per cent of the population were classified as rural by the census of Canada in 1881; by 1921 the percentage had decreased to 50.48. Capital investment in manufactures increased from $165,302,632 in 1880 to $2,923,667,011 in 1920 and the gross value of all manufactured products from $469,847,886 in 1880 to $3,706,544,997 in 1920. Manufacturing, once diffused, was concentrating in industrial towns. Factories increasingly replaced small workshops, and steam-powered engines brought noise as well as productivity. As the nuisances of industrialization increased, so did the costs of eliminating them. Manufacturing establishments, for example, were becoming sufficiently large and important to local economies that ordering them to take their nuisances elsewhere would have had serious consequences.

Like their English and American counterparts before them, common law courts in Canada struggled to adjudicate nuisance claims in this evolving context, which often pitted the demands of business and the growing influence of industry against the traditional property rights of neighbouring landowners. However, because industrialization came relatively late to Canada, Canadian courts confronted nuisance cases against the background of legal principles already developed elsewhere. A key question became to what extent Canadian courts would follow these established precedents-—primarily from England-—or chart their own path.

Traditionally, the common law afforded heavy priority to the absolute protection of private owners rights to use and enjoy their property, enforced by way of an injunction against the offending activities of neighbouring landowners. In the *Shelfer* case you will read this week, the Court opened the door for greater flexibility on the part of courts to substitute an award of damages in place of a permanent injunction in appropriate circumstances. Legal historians have largely interpreted this move as an attempt by the Court to take a more accommodating position toward industrial interests.

## Restrictive Covenants as "Private" Land Use Planning

In one sense, an alternative to the law of nuisance as supplying after-the-fact remedies to emerging or pre-existing land use conflicts is to develop and apply a set of legal restrictions on what one can do with their land in the first place. This approach came to be represented in the law on restrictive covenants that--at least initially--was seen as nothing more than a set of contractual terms between neighboring landowners. With the precedent in *Tulk and Moxhay*, which you will read this week, such contracts were transformed into a set of durable restraints on the proprietary freedom of owners subject to their terms. Restrictive covenants thereafter would eventually become a crucial way for private owners to engage with one another in processes of land use planning and control--to, for example, establish and sustain the "character" of their neighborhoods against the advance of urban pollution from heavy industry.
