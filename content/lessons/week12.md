This week, will begin to revisit some of last term's topics from the perspective of the modern style of Anglo-Canadian thought. Our primary focus this week will pick up on our discussion of constructive expropriation from the *McLaren v Caldwell* and *Manitoba Fisheries Inc.*. Recall that these cases involve claimed "takings" of property rights (or "sticks" from the ownership bundle) by the state, for which the owner would like to receive some form of compensation.

The line of cases we will read this week develop the more robust contemporary common law framework and legal test for resolving these claims about constructive takings. However, this area of the law remains heavily contested and is continually evolving.

In addition to issues of constructive expropriation, we will also explore the related issue of "acquired rights" (sometimes called "legal non-conforming uses"). Such rights arise in the hands of landowners engaged in pre-existing land uses when a zoning or other land-use bylaw changes. Provincial statutes, combined with common law doctrine, generally permit owners to maintain pre-existing uses even when those uses are prohibited by the new bylaw. But because such uses can themselves change and evolve over time, this area of the law raises difficult questions about how far the protections afforded by acquired rights can and should extend.
