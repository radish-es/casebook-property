## Animals

Allen Greer suggests that early legal encounters between Indigenous peoples and European imperialists in North America were much more concerned with imperial and commercial concerns rather than land settlement per se. Central to this context was the hunting and trading of wild animals. Much of the property law of the time was shaped in this context of encounter.  

Tina Loo observes that Blackstone's view that wild animals were common property, open to anyone for the taking, was embraced by early colonists in North America, particularly in the Thirteen Colonies. Hunting was framed as an expression of fundamental freedom by colonists and contrasted with Old World restrictions. Colonists in British North America were more permissive of wildlife regulations that curbed hunting access [@loo2006StatesNature, 13-14].

## A Question of Recognition

This week we start to explore a fundamental issue: How do (and should) relationships to land get recognized in law? And what does the answer tell us about the issue of who benefits from different forms of relation? 

From an Anglo-Canadian legal perspective, significant attention is paid to acts of *possession*, as you saw from our discussion of *Harrison v Carswell* last week. It is by possessing something that a person gains recognition of certain legal entitlements that we tend to call "property"--a relationship that is at once physical (an act of control) and psychological (a matter of intention). But of course this is not the only possible kind of relationship to land that law might recognize and prioritize. Indigenous Nations approach these relationships in the context of their own legal orders, and treaties provide an inter-societal and transnational framework for encounters between different systems, principles and worldviews. In class this week, we will start by discussing the historical context for these land relations in Mi'kma'ki / Atlantic Canada in order to set the stage for our weekly problem.
