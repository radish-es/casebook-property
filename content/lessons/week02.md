## Animals

Allen Greer suggests that early legal encounters between Indigenous peoples and European imperialists in North America were much more concerned with imperial and commercial concerns rather than land settlement per se. Central to this context was the hunting and trading of wild animals. Much of the property law of the time was shaped in this context of encounter.  

Tina Loo observes that Blackstone's view that wild animals were common property, open to anyone for the taking, was embraced by early colonists in North America, particularly in the Thirteen Colonies. Hunting was framed as an expression of fundamental freedom by colonists and contrasted with Old World restrictions. Colonists in British North America were more permissive of wildlife regulations that curbed hunting access [@loo2006StatesNature, 13-14].

## A Question of Recognition

This week we start to explore a fundamental issue: How do (and should) relationships to land get recognized in law? Which kinds of relations "count" and which do not? And what does this tell us about the question of who benefits? 

From an Anglo-Canadian legal perspective, significant attention is paid to acts of *possession*, as you saw from our discussion of *Harrison v Carswell* last week. It is by possessing something that a person gains recognition of certain legal entitlements--a relationship that is at once physical (an act of control) and psychological (a matter of intention). But this is not the only possible kind of relationship to land that law might recognize and prioritize. Indigenous legal orders may approach these relationships in very different ways, and treaties provide a kind of inter-societal framework for encounters between these different relational forms.
