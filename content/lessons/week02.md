## Problem of Recognition

This week we start to explore a fundamental problem in the law of property: the problem of *recognition*. How do (and should) relationships to land get recognized? Which kinds of relations "count" and which do not? And what does this tell us about who benefits? 

From an Anglo-Canadian legal perspective, a significant emphasis is afforded to the act of *possession*. It is by possessing something that a person gains recognition of certain legal entitlements--a relationship that is at once physical (an act of control) and psychological (a matter of intention). But this is not the only possible kind of relationship that property law might recognize and prioritize. In fact, much of the history of common law property involves a colonial project of possession and control developed to mask Indigenous legal relationships to land that reveal very different logics of recognition. 

The materials this week will help us to explore the problem of recognition from perspectives both inside and outside Anglo-Canadian law. 

## Liberalism and Legal Style

Last week, we drew an analogy between law and language, noting that the "vocabulary" of Anglo-Canadian legal arguments resembles a set of typical, highly patterned arguments used by jurists to debate and reason through a problem or dispute. Our discussion of this vocabulary left us with a nagging question: *How can these back-and-forth legal arguments ever help us to actually resolve a problem, to decide which judgement or decision or outcome is more persuasive?* If every legal argument has predictable counter-arguments, how does one side of the argument ever "win out" over the other?

From a historical perspective, the answer to this question depends--in part--on *when* we are asking it. In other words, the question of *persuasiveness* is closely tied to the concept of legal styles that emerge from and evolve over particular periods of time. For much of our course, we will draw this link by exploring two contrasting styles of Anglo-Canadian legal thought that are both based on its basic grammatical structure, which we will introduce this week as the basic structure of Western liberalism.  

## Our Problem this Week

We return to our [hypothetical setting of West Eggleston]({{< ref "problems/wowkwis" >}}) to begin unpacking the problem of recognition and its connection to legal style. Remember, you can read the assigned material in any order you choose by following the links on each page, but note that all of the material assigned is mandatory and you should review all of it before our first class of the week.

## The Basic Dilemma of Liberalism

A fundamental tenant of liberal thought holds that all human beings should be free to pursue their own ends and, in doing so, to compete with one another to pursue those ends. The dilemma of liberalism arises when we recognize that society can only benefit from free competition among individuals when it limits individual freedoms to some degree. In other words, individual freedom for any one person--as measured by the degree to which that person is free *from* societal control--is simply impossible without putting societal limits on the freedoms of everyone else.

Anglo-Canadian jurists have, historically, tried to "resolve" the dilemma of liberalism in different ways. The two styles of common law we will explore in this course--classical and modern--are defined by their different approaches to this basic dilemma. In particular, we can use the following three questions to identify and explore which style(s) is/are operating in a given case or context:[^stein2018]

### Three Questions of Common Law Style

1. **Competition vs Control**: which "side" of the basic liberal dilemma does the judge or jurist emphasize, prioritize or privileged--free competition or societal limitations on that freedom?

2. **Public vs Private**: to what extent are the "public" and "private" spheres treated as separate and distinct? Does the the line between these spheres appear clear and sharp, or blurred (maybe even erased)? 

3. **Formalist vs Functionalist**: by what process does the common law develop, i.e. how is law made? Is law "discovered" from settled principles or "determined" according to its capacity to meet social/political/economic circumstances? 

We will use these three questions throughout the course to study the different ways that classical and modern styles of thought manifest in judicial decisions and other sources of property law.
