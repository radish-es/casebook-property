## The Problem of Recognition

This week we start to explore a fundamental problem in the law of property: the problem of *recognition*. How do (and should) relationships to land get recognized in law? Which kinds of relations "count" and which do not? And what does this tell us about the question of who benefits? 

From an Anglo-Canadian legal perspective, significant attention is paid to acts of *possession*, as you saw from our discussion of *Harrison v Carswell* last week. It is by possessing something that a person gains recognition of certain legal entitlements--a relationship that is at once physical (an act of control) and psychological (a matter of intention). But this is not the only possible kind of relationship that property law might recognize and prioritize. In fact, much of the history of common law property involves the colonial project of possession and control developed to mask or make invisible Indigenous legal relationships to land that reveal very different logics of recognition. Pay close attention to the language and assumptions about Indigenous peoples and Indigenous law in the materials this week and please note that some of this can be difficult to read. 

## Liberalism and Legal Style

Last week, we drew an analogy between law and language, noting that the "vocabulary" of Anglo-Canadian legal arguments resembles a set of typical, highly patterned arguments used by jurists to debate and reason through a problem or dispute. Our discussion of this vocabulary left us with a nagging question: *How can these back-and-forth legal arguments ever help us to actually resolve a problem, to decide which judgement or decision or outcome is more persuasive?* If every legal argument has predictable counter-arguments, how does one side of the argument ever "win out" over the other?

From a historical perspective, the answer to this question has often depended--in part--on *when* we are asking it. In other words, the question of *persuasiveness* is closely tied to the concept of legal styles that emerge from and evolve over particular historical periods of legal thought. For much of our course, we will draw this link by exploring two contrasting styles of Anglo-Canadian legal thought that are both rooted in its basic grammatical structure, which we will introduce this week as the basic structure of Western liberalism.  

## Our Problem this Week

We return to our hypothetical setting of West Eggleston for this week's problem, *[Wowkwis]({{< ref "problems/wowkwis" >}})*, to begin unpacking the problem of recognition and its connection to legal style. Remember, you can read the assigned material in any order you choose by following the links on each page, but note that all of the material assigned is mandatory and you should review all of it before our first class of the week.
