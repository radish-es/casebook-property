description: We now turn our minds to issues of "exit"--i.e., how owns transfer their property rights to another party. 
---

Having now studied some of the historical basis for problems of *recognition* and *exclusion*, this week we move on to examine the context of *exit*: how owners transfer their rights in land and thereby disentangle themselves (wholly or partially) from property relations. 

Central to this context are persistent tensions between an owner's right to *alienate* property and their power to place restrictions on future owners' rights to do the same. As we will see, courts often put a heavy emphasis on the free alienability of land. Any attempts to restrict free alienability are viewed with considerable skepticism in the classical styleâ€”consistent with the liberal ideal that property rights should support individuals to pursue their own ends. We will read cases in which the courts scrutinize clauses in a will that purport to limit how or when beneficiaries under that will can transfer the property interests they receive. 

In order to understand the controversies around alienability we study this week, we will first need some further background on the doctrine of estates in land. This is a big and reasonably complex topic that we will return to again next term, but we will start with the basic elements of common law estates and practice identifying key interests. These topics will provide the foundation for understanding issues surrounding alienability in the cases.
