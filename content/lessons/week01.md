For first-year law students, "property" can be a kaleidoscopic subject: fragmentary, blinkered, disorienting. As one (among many) possible ways of mediating our relationships with and in respect of the world--both corporeal and not--property offers up a disorderly patchwork of principles, rules and norms. It is full of contradictions, real and apparent. It presents a space of dispossession and disadvantage for some, prosperity and security for others.

There are likewise many ways to teach and learn about property, to try to make sense of and bring some order within the kaleidoscope. In this course, we will approach the subject from a historical perspective–one that puts the critical emphasis on the role of land relationships in Canada’s political economy as the legal ground that determines so much about who benefits from the economic system and who does not.

This first week of the course introduces you to the core method of problem-based learning in the course and starts to develop some key questions and themes we will explore throughout the year. 

## Read the Syllabus

Before you start to explore the course materials, please familiarize yourself with the procedures and expectations for our course this year. Start by reading the Course Syllabus and reviewing the Course Schedule. These are the main documents you'll need to use throughout the year to understand the course logistics, expectations, policies and schedule for assigned readings and class meetings.

Aim to begin this week with a good understanding of:

- Course Procedures for communicating with me and arranging appointments outside of class meetings;

- How to access the course website and assigned materials;

- Goals and expectations for class preparation and participation in class meetings;

- How you will be evaluated in the course; and

- Your rights and responsibilities related to accessibility and accommodations.

I will highlight some key points from these materials at the beginning of this week's class meeting and will make time for your questions about the syllabus. 

## Problem-Based, Hypertext Learning

You will quickly notice that this casebook looks quite different from most of the other legal casebooks you are using in first year. The casebook is fully digital and freely accessible online, but more importantly it is organized around two key learning approaches:

1. **Problem-based:** all of your reading and our classroom meetings will be based on problems --  hypothetical, or drawn from real-world events. These problems are designed to help you focus on using the course materials (cases, statues, articles, etc) to identify relevant questions and to explore different ways to answer those questions.  

2. **Hypertext:** rather than working through a linear progression of material, as in a printed book, this casebook requires you to follow different pathways of connection (links) between different components of the course. As a result, there is no single, correct order in which to engage the course materials that are assigned weekly. Part of what you will be asked to do in this course is to develop your own understanding of how each piece or component is connected to the whole. 

## Our First Problem

Rather than spend too much time on abstract concepts, our plan for this first week is to jump right into practice. Start by reading our first problem: *[Protest at East Eggleston]({{< ref "problems/protest" >}})*. From there, please review and take notes on the linked "Related Reading" that appears in the right-hand column on each page. 

You may choose to read the assigned material in any order by following the links on each page. But please note that all of the material assigned is mandatory and you should have completed all of it before our first class of the week. This week, that includes *Harrison v Carswell*, the *Protection of Property Act*
and a short except on "Trespass to Land".
