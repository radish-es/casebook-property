## Read the Syllabus

Before you start to explore the course materials, please familiarize yourself with the procedures and expectations for our course this year. Start by reading the Course Syllabus and reviewing the Course Schedule. These are the main documents you'll need to use throughout the year to understand the course logistics, expectations, policies and schedule for assigned readings and class meetings.

Aim to begin this week with a good understanding of:

- Course Procedures for communicating with me and arranging appointments outside of class meetings;

- How to access the course website and assigned materials;

- Goals and expectations for class preparation and participation in class meetings;

- How you will be evaluated in the course; and

- Your rights and responsibilities related to accessibility and accommodations.

I will highlight some key points from these materials at the beginning of this week's class meeting and will make time for your questions about the syllabus. If questions arise as you read the syllabus for the first time, you can submit them to me (anonymously) ahead of time using the form below.

## Problem-Based, Hypertext Learning

You will quickly notice that this casebook looks quite different from most of the other legal casebooks you will use in first year. The casebook is fully digital and freely accessible online, but more importantly it is organized around two key approaches to learning:

1. **Problem-based:** all of your reading and our classroom meetings will be based around problems -- either hypothetical, or drawn from real-world events. These problems are designed to help you focus on using the course materials (cases, statues, articles, etc) to identify relevant questions and to explore different ways to answer those questions.  

2. **Hypertext:** rather than working through a linear progression of material, as in a printed book, this casebook requires you to follow different pathways of connection (links) between different components of the course. As a result, there is no single, correct order in which to engage the course materials--part of what you will be asked to do in this course is develop your own understanding of how each piece or component is connected to the whole. 

## Our First Problem
