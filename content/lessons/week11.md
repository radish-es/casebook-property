While [accurate data](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/canada-homeless-population-health-data-halifax-1.6894448) on the circumstances of unhoused people can be difficult to get, Canada is clearly experiencing a [rise in chronic homelessness](https://housing-infrastructure.canada.ca/homelessness-sans-abri/reports-rapports/data-shelter-2022-donnees-refuge-eng.html#), even as shelter capacity in many cities has increased following the COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in widespread sheltering in public spaces--both temporary and longer-term--in many Canadian cities. 

Addressing homelessness and access to housing engages a complex set of legal and policy issues, actors and decision-making networks. One aspect of this context in which Canadian courts have been especially active is the constitutional right of unhoused persons to access and shelter in public spaces--namely, municipal --in order to meet their immediate needs. The role of these rights and challenges to their realization have gained national attention from the circumstances in cities around the country.

Our goal this week is to explore how rights to access public property in the shelter context have emerged and evolved in the common law courts, primarily through a series of cases in British Columbia and Ontario since the mid-2000s. We will aim to understand the changing scope of these rights over time, and grapple with the implications of courts' heavy reliance on a functionalist approach to the right to shelter in this context.
