## The Legal Imprimatur of Title

So far in our course we have discussed the central role of possession in Anglo-Canadian law and its complex connections to ownership and title going back to early liberal theory. But to date, we have not talked much about what these terms of "ownership and "title" really mean. Our goal this week is a more thorough understanding of title and its various forms--with a focus on the history and context surrounding the common law doctrine of "Aboriginal title".
