description: Building on the previous lesson's exploration of possession and title, this week we focus on the various meanings of "title" and their application in the context of Indigenous land rights recognized by Anglo-Canadian law.

## The Legal Imprimatur of Title

So far in our course we have discussed the central role of possession in Anglo-Canadian law and its complex connections to ownership and title going back to early liberal theory. But to date, we have not talked much about what these terms of "ownership and "title" really mean. Our goal this week is a more thorough understanding of title and its various forms--with a focus on the history and context surrounding the common law doctrine of "Aboriginal title". 

## Our Problem this Week

This week, our problem takes a different form than the "hypothetical" fact pattern we've studied in the past few lessons. Instead, we explore the context of a contemporary land claim by the Wolastoqey Nation to their traditional territory encompassing much of present-day New Brunswick.
