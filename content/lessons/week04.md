## Property and Exclusion

Over the past few weeks we have been focused on how classical legal thought addressed questions of possession and title. We now turn to a second prominent topic--one that mainly addresses the *content* of property rights held by owners or those in possession. 

One right in particular, some argue, is fundamental to private property: the *right to exclude* others from interfering with the owner's use and enjoyment of their land, other tangible things and even intangibles like knowledge goods. The common law has devised several remedies to enforce owners' right to exclude. We have already seen one example: in *Harrison v Carswell*, the mall owner brought an action in *trespass* against the picketer Sophie Carswell to exclude her from the mall sidewalk.

This week, we will look at a different type of tort action that engages one's right to exclude, but also—reciprocally—others' rights to use their property as they wish: an action in *nuisance*. Our focus here will be somewhat narrower that you might have encountered in your torts class. We will explore nuisance law as a "property tort" for what it can tell us about how judges in the mode of classical legal thought address the clash of private property rights between neighbours and to what extent courts have been willing to enforce an owner's right to exclude.

Much of our focus here is on one aspect of nuisance doctrine: the question of *remedy*. Once a nuisance has been established on the facts, should courts grant an injunction to prevent the nuisance-causing activity or should courts award damages to compensate the plaintiff for their losses? The former option most effectively enforces the owner's right to exclude, while the latter forces the owner to accept payment for an ongoing "violation" of that right.

## Nuisance Law in an Industrializing Canada

Widespread industrialization came somewhat late in Canada compared to England and the United States, where nuisance law was earlier addressed in the common law courts as a potential impediment to economic "progress". As Jennifer Nedelsky explains:[^nedelsky1981]

> By the late nineteenth century, industrialization and urbanization were changing the shape of Canadian society: between 1880 and 1920 the population doubled from 3,689,257 to 8,788,483; 74.35 per cent of the population were classified as rural by the census of Canada in 1881; by 1921 the percentage had decreased to 50.48. Capital investment in manufactures increased from $165,302,632 in 1880 to $2,923,667,011 in 1920 and the gross value of all manufactured products from $469,847,886 in 1880 to $3,706,544,997 in 1920. Manufacturing, once diffused, was concentrating in industrial towns. Factories increasingly replaced small workshops, and steam-powered engines brought noise as well as productivity. As the nuisances of industrialization increased, so did the costs of eliminating them. Manufacturing establishments, for example, were becoming sufficiently large and important to local economies that ordering them to take their nuisances elsewhere would have had serious consequences.

Like their English and American counterparts before them, common law courts in Canada struggled to adjudicate nuisance claims in this evolving context, which often pitted the demands of business and the growing influence of industry against the traditional property rights of neighbouring landowners. However, because industrialization came relatively late to Canada, Canadian courts confronted nuisance cases against the background of legal principles already developed elsewhere. A key question became to what extent Canadian courts would follow these established precedents-—primarily from England-—or chart their own path.

Traditionally, the common law afforded heavy priority to the absolute protection of private owners rights to use and enjoy their property, enforced by way of an injunction against the offending activities of neighbouring landowners. In the *Shelfer* case you will read this week, the Court opened the door for greater flexibility on the part of courts to substitute an award of damages in place of a permanent injunction in appropriate circumstances. Legal historians have largely interpreted this move as an attempt by the Court to take a more accommodating position toward industrial interests. 

## Our Problem this Week

While taking the form of a hypothetical fact pattern as we've seen in some past weeks, [our problem this week]({{< ref "problems/gmos" >}}) asks you to approach it as a jurist tasked with writing a legal decision that will persuasively resolve the dispute.
