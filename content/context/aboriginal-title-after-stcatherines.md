At this point, you have read three different judgements in the *St. Catherine's Milling* case: the judgement at trial by Chancellor Boyd, Justice Strong's dissent at the Supreme Court of Canada, and Lord Watson's final decision for the Privy Council. As you try to make sense of the different interpretations and rationales offered by the judges with respect to common law Aboriginal title, consider their different answers to the following questions:

- What is the *source* of the rights that are encompassed by Aboriginal title? Where do these rights come from?

- What is the *nature* or *content* of Aboriginal title? Are the rights encompassed by Aboriginal title the same as or different from the property rights we have examined so far in the course?
