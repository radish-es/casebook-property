description: An introduction to Holme's decision in *Mahon*

---

We now want to see how Holmes' ideas about the modern style play out in a case about *de facto* expropriation.

After he wrote *The Path of Law*, Holmes became a leading member of the United States Supreme Court. In 1922, he penned the majority decision in one of the first major U.S. cases about regulatory takings, *Pennsylvania Coal Co. v Mahon*. 

**Why we're reading it:** *Mahon* is an early example of two judges—Holmes for the majority, and Brandeis in dissent—embracing the modern style, despite their disagreement on the outcome of the case. 

- But in *Mahon* we also see vestiges of the classical approach. 

- Try to identify the work done by Holmes' functionalist method in *Mahon*.

- Why do the judges in the case disagree about whether or not there has been a *de facto* expropriation of the coal company's property?
