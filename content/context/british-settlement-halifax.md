Halifax was settled by the British in Mi'kma'ki without lawful authority or consent from the Mi'kmaq, on land the Mi'kmaq call Kâ€™jipuktuk. Like other places in Canada, Halifax's colonial origins are rooted in the violent displacement and dispossession of Indigenous peoples. This legacy forms a central piece of the legal context for the city today.[^taskforce2020]

Britain's settlement of Halifax in 1749 was interposed between and closely linked with the Peace and Friendship Treaties signed by the British and Mi'kmaq in 1725 and then in 1752 and 1760-61. As noted above, interpreting the terms of these treaties is a complicated exercise, but it is unambiguous that, as nation-to-nation agreements, they are based on the ideas of building ongoing relationships and of reciprocity. Just as Halifax was settled in apparent breach of the 1725 treaty, the 1752 treaty and subsequent treaties might be seen as a direct response and attempt to repair the relationship between the Mi'kmaq and the British in the aftermath.
