title: African Nova Scotian Settlement
short: ANS Settlement

---

Although African Nova Scotians have lived in Nova Scotia since 17th century (many of them enslaved by British settlers), the major waves of African Nova Scotian migration occured in the 18th and 19th centuries. First the Black Loyalists, who sided with Britain during the American Revolutionary War in the 1780s; then the Jamaican Maroons in 1796, formerly-enslaved Africans deported to Nova Scotia after they fought for their freedom in Jamaica; and finally the Black Refugees, who were incited by British offers of freedom and land during the War of 1812. 

Many of these new arrivals to Nova Scotia--both African Nova Scotians and white settlers--received "tickets of location" or "licenses of occupation" rather than receiving land grants. These tickets gave settlers possession of the land, but did not confer full ownership or title. Practically, this meant settlers with these tickets or licenses could not do things like sell or mortgage their property. 

While both white settlers and African Nova Scotians received these tickets, the land law system in Nova Scotia perpetuated anti-Black racism in other ways. Black Refugees, for example, were often given tickets of occupation for smaller and poorer-quality lot sizes than white settlers, excluded from subsequent legislation intended to benefit impoverished settlers, and adversely impacted by later land title clarification initiatives.[^marsman] We will look more closely at these effects in Term 2.
