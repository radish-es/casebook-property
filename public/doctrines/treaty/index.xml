      <title>&#34;Possession&#34; from an Indigenous Worldview</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The common law approach to possession and communicating possession is not a universal one. Notice how James (sákéj) Youngblood Henderson inverts the common law&amp;rsquo;s concept of &amp;ldquo;possession&amp;rdquo; as he describes an Indigenous conception of belonging &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; land. In addition, consider the way Henderson engages with some of the common law rationales for property rights regimes we looked at previously&amp;hellip; &lt;!--this idea probably needs to be expanded or made more specific but I wasn&#39;t sure how to do it without knowing how we&#39;ll describe the rationales.--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Early Interpretation of the 1752 Treaty</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1928, Grand Chief Gabriel Syliboy was charged and ultimately convicted of hunting muskrats out of season on Unamaki (Cape Breton). Justice Patterson&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of the 1752 treaty in &lt;em&gt;R v Syliboy&lt;/em&gt;—though ultimately rejected by Canadian courts—would stand as an authoritative common law precedent for many years to come. The decision would influence relationships between Mi&amp;rsquo;kmaq peoples and the Crown long after it was issued. As William Wicken notes:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In approaching treaties signed with Mi&amp;rsquo;kmaq peoples, federal and provincial governments have ignored community perspectives and reinforced Judge Patterson&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint of treaty-making. Though treaty issues have been before the courts on numerous occasions over the past sixty years, scant attention has been focused on how the Mi&amp;rsquo;kmaq understood treaties both at their signing and afterward. A 1974 memorandum, for instance, sent by Nova Scotia&amp;rsquo;s deputy Attorney-General, to the president of the Union of Nova Scotia Indians noted that:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introduction to Treaty Relationships</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week we studied the historical roots of the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title and saw, in &lt;em&gt;St. Catherine&amp;rsquo;s Milling&lt;/em&gt;, how classical legal thought framed the courts&amp;rsquo; conclusion that Indigenous land rights were &amp;ldquo;personal&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;proprietary&amp;rdquo;. We left off with the observation that beneath the issue of Aboriginal title foregrounded in &lt;em&gt;St. Catherine&amp;rsquo;s Milling&lt;/em&gt; was the doctrine of &lt;em&gt;terra nullius&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;ldquo;land belonging to no one&amp;rdquo;). Aspects of &lt;em&gt;terra nullius&lt;/em&gt;—paired with the doctrine of discovery—undergird courts&amp;rsquo; continued assumption of Crown sovereignty and the exclusion of Indigenous sovereignties up to the present day. One consequence of this doctrine has been to largely exclude Indigenous legal orders from the consciousness of the common law.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mi&#39;kmaw Land Tenure</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Court in &lt;em&gt;Syliboy&lt;/em&gt; deployed each of the core themes of colonialism in property law we introduced in Week 1 in order to interpret the 1752 Peace and Friendship Treaty. The &lt;em&gt;Syliboy&lt;/em&gt; decision provided a deeply problematic footing on which to set the common law&amp;rsquo;s understanding of treaty rights and in some significant ways tracked the developing common law doctrine of Aboriginal title. But despite the &lt;em&gt;Syliboy&lt;/em&gt; decision&amp;rsquo;s long influence on treaty interpretation in Mi&amp;rsquo;kma&amp;rsquo;ki, in its aftermath Mi&amp;rsquo;kmaw jurists continued to offer alternative interpretations grounded in the Mi&amp;rsquo;kmaw legal order and worldview.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Netukulimk</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mi&amp;rsquo;kmaw legal traditions and Netukulimk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the Mi&amp;rsquo;kmaq and the forest ecosystem is more intimate than suggested in court. It is foundational to their worldview, integral to their legal traditions, and constitutional rights. This evidence was not before the courts, but it would have been useful to the courts if properly presented as part of Mi&amp;rsquo;kmaq constitutional law, as well as the foundation of aboriginal and treaty rights as constitutional law of Canada. The relationship between the forest and Mi&amp;rsquo;kmaq people is deeply embodied in the Mi&amp;rsquo;kmaq knowledge system and legal traditions, a relationship beginning with the Creation story.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Peace and Friendship Treaties</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The early eighteenth-century in what is today Eastern Canada was characterized by political and military struggles and alliances between three powers in the region: the Wabanaki (a political alliance of Mi&amp;rsquo;kmaw, Wolastoqiyik, and Passamaquoddy peoples, and a separate alliance of communities known as the Abenaki), the British, and the French. 1726 saw the end of a three-year war between New England and the Wabanaki, which had been grounded in concerns about colonial expansion northward (including incursions on Indigenous fishing territories and colonial land settlement). In turn, the British were becoming increasingly motivated to forge friendly relationships with the Wabanaki as counter-weight to French power. This period culminated in the signing of the Treaty of 1725 by various parties between that year and 1726.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He made no attempt to deny having the pelts, indeed frankly admits having them, but claims that as an Indian he is not bound by the provisions of the Act, but has by Treaty the right to hunt and trap at all times. Every now and then for a number of years one has heard that our Indians were making these claims but, so far as I know, the matter has never been before a Court.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Terra Nullius</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/casebook/relationships/terra-nullius/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/casebook/relationships/terra-nullius/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terra nullius&lt;/em&gt; is a term that refers to a “territory without a master.” It is a term used in public international law to describe a space that can be inhabited but that does not belong to a state, meaning the land is not owned by anyone. In fact, when a State or an entity describes a land as a &lt;em&gt;terra nullius&lt;/em&gt;, the land is in reality occupied – by a nation or a minority – but the term has oftentimes been used in order to legitimize state occupation and colonization. In international public law, when the definition &lt;em&gt;terra nullius&lt;/em&gt; is given to a land, it can legally legitimize its occupation and acquisition of sovereignty by another nation, under the doctrine of discovery, which the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has approved as a legal method of acquisition of territory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
