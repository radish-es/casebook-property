      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-i-first-nations-land-management-foundations&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Part I: First Nations Land Management Foundations&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#part-i-first-nations-land-management-foundations&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the 2015 federal election campaign, the Liberal Party of Canada&#xA;campaigned on a platform of significant commitments to Indigenous&#xA;peoples, including the promise to &amp;ldquo;renew the relationship between Canada&#xA;and Indigenous Peoples.&amp;rdquo; But tellingly, they framed their platform as&#xA;&amp;ldquo;both a right thing to do and a surefire way to economic growth.&amp;rdquo; In&#xA;the emerging era of sectoral self-governance, the First Nations Land&#xA;Management Regime has become a key feature not only in the federal&#xA;government&amp;rsquo;s notion  of the &amp;ldquo;right thing,&amp;rdquo; but also their plans to chip away at the &lt;em&gt;Indian&#xA;Act&lt;/em&gt; and make First Nations more &amp;ldquo;economically independent.&amp;rdquo; Of course,&#xA;this economic growth or independence does not include a redistribution&#xA;of land or resources, rather it is an expectation that First Nations&#xA;should support their members through economic activities exclusively on&#xA;reserve lands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
