I am of opinion that it is not. The will of Donald Chisholm after devising his farm of 100 acres to his two sons William and Hugh in fee and equally dividing it between them, contained the following provision:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Introduction&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#introduction&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having now studied the roles of &lt;em&gt;possession&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;exclusion&lt;/em&gt; in common law property, this week we move on to examine the context of &lt;em&gt;exit&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash;that is, how it is that owners extract themselves from property relations. Central to this context is the right to &lt;em&gt;alienate&lt;/em&gt; property and the power of owners to place restrictions on alienability. Recall that we have already encountered alienation and restraints on alienation in the context of Aboriginal title going back to the Royal Proclamation in 1763. As we learn this week, the extent to which landowners can and should be able transfer their property rights to others and to place limits on alienation has long raised some pervasive controversies in common law property.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
