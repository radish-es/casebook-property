  Part I: First Nations Land Management Foundations
  #

During the 2015 federal election campaign, the Liberal Party of Canada
campaigned on a platform of significant commitments to Indigenous
peoples, including the promise to &ldquo;renew the relationship between Canada
and Indigenous Peoples.&rdquo; But tellingly, they framed their platform as
&ldquo;both a right thing to do and a surefire way to economic growth.&rdquo; In
the emerging era of sectoral self-governance, the First Nations Land
Management Regime has become a key feature not only in the federal
government&rsquo;s notion  of the &ldquo;right thing,&rdquo; but also their plans to chip away at the Indian
Act and make First Nations more &ldquo;economically independent.&rdquo; Of course,
this economic growth or independence does not include a redistribution
of land or resources, rather it is an expectation that First Nations
should support their members through economic activities exclusively on
reserve lands.">

  Part I: First Nations Land Management Foundations

</h2>
<p>During the 2015 federal election campaign, the Liberal Party of Canada
campaigned on a platform of significant commitments to Indigenous
peoples, including the promise to &ldquo;renew the relationship between Canada
and Indigenous Peoples.&rdquo; But tellingly, they framed their platform as
&ldquo;both a right thing to do and a surefire way to economic growth.&rdquo; In
the emerging era of sectoral self-governance, the First Nations Land
Management Regime has become a key feature not only in the federal
government&rsquo;s notion  of the &ldquo;right thing,&rdquo; but also their plans to chip away at the <em>Indian
Act</em> and make First Nations more &ldquo;economically independent.&rdquo; Of course,
this economic growth or independence does not include a redistribution
of land or resources, rather it is an expectation that First Nations
should support their members through economic activities exclusively on
reserve lands.</p>
<p>Despite this concern, the First Nations Land Management Regime has grown
considerably with many communities applying and being accepted into the
process each year. Indeed, we do not outright reject the positive
possibilities for communities taking over the management of reserve
lands from the federal government and developing their own land
management policies.</p>
<p>However, it is important to analyze the First Nations Land Management
Regime within the larger context of alienation from our traditional
territories through market forces and colonial policies.</p>
<p>In our view, as treaty people, the threat of the First Nations Land
Management Regime is that it overwrites our treaty history and
obligations. Beyond this, for people whose nations do not have
historical or contemporary treaties with the Crown, the threat of the
politics of distraction is also at play in that we believe we should be
having a larger, more robust conversation with the Crown regarding
jurisdiction and management of lands and resources in Canada.<br>
It is important to state at the outset that the <em>Indian Act</em>, the <em>First
Nations Land Management Act</em>, and the Framework Agreement on First
Nation Land Management make no substantive reference to treaties. This
regime is about a very limited type of self governance and does not
substantively implement the self-determination envisioned by our
ancestors through treaty or inherent rights. This aforementioned point
conforms to much government policy and was highlighted by <em>The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples</em>
in 1996. The report stated that &ldquo;it is almost as if Canada deliberately allowed itself to forget the principal constitutional mechanism by which the nation status of Indian communities is recognized in domestic law.&rdquo; This includes the Numbered Treaties, the eleven agreements that span Ontario, the Plains and into B.C. and the Northwest Territories, negotiated between 1871 - 1921.</p>
<p>One of the goals of the Numbered Treaties, from an Indigenous
perspective, is to protect Indigenous territories and livelihoods.</p>
<p>However, we know that the hegemonic Canadian perspective of the Numbered
Treaties (and all other treaties into the very recent present) is that
they are land surrenders to the Crown. For those without agreements with
the Crown, who refer to their land as &lsquo;unceded&rsquo;, the scope of this
regime is obviously very limited.</p>
<p>In this report, we first review the <em>political economy</em> of the regime,
since economic development is a major motivation for both First Nations
and Canada.</p>
<p>Though, we believe the current economic system we are working within
will never provide robust freedom for Indigenous peoples, we also
believe that we should not outright reject efforts to ensure fewer of
our people live in poverty.</p>
<p>Second, since this report is meant to be a resource for communities, we
critically examine the <em>process</em> of creating and ratifying a Land Code.
Much of the criticism of FNLMA stems from the ratification process and
whether it constitutes proper consent. Later we write about the
<em>implications</em> of this regime for Treaty and non-Treaty First Nations, as well as the larger landscape of Indigenous governance
in Canada.</p>

  Political Economy of the First Nations Land Management Regime

</h3>
<p>Current and proposed Canadian legislation, including the voluntary
<em>First Nations Land Management Act</em> and proposals for First Nations
private property ownership, seek to alter the relationship communities
have to their reserve land bases by
offering a mechanism for First Nations to take over the &rsquo;everyday&rsquo;
management of those lands. Under a community developed Land Code, First
Nations are able to act at the &ldquo;speed of business&rdquo;, set terms for land
related transactions, business licencing, zoning, and draft their own
land management bylaws. This opens up reserve lands to further
development (of course this is one of the main motivations for First
Nations to enter the process). Currently, under the <em>Indian Act</em>, First
Nations have to acquire permission from the Minister of Crown Indigenous
Relations to allow commercial development of reserve lands. In a
three-part review of the First Nations Land Management Regime, KPMG found that the
Framework Agreement generates positive benefits for Canada, meaning that
overall, the Regime has contributed to the Canadian economy.</p>
<p>However, there are currently no studies that prove whether the First
Nations Land Management Regime has reduced poverty on reserve or whether
increased overall wealth of those First Nations has contributed to
better socio-economic indicators, such as health, language renewal, or
cultural revitalization.</p>
<p>Through the First Nations Land Management Regime, the federal government
offloads fiscal, fiduciary, and environmental responsibilities and
serves to benefit from the increased business capacity of First Nations.
Though KPMG found that no First Nations that entered the process would
choose to go back to land  management under the <em>Indian Act</em> (which is not actually an option),
First Nations who have ratified a Land Code have critiqued the cost and
effort bore solely by the First Nation to develop land policies and
laws, as well as higher insurance borne solely by First Nations to cover
extended liabilities with regards to environmental management. Though
the federal government is responsible for<br>
environmental damage and contamination that occurred before the transfer
of land management, a First Nation assumes liability and responsibility
for any environmental issues that occur after a Land Code takes
effect.</p>
<p>Additionally, though First Nations receive funding to hire a land manager or other such staff to contribute to the development and enforcement of laws under the Land Code, including environmental assessment laws, these funding levels are set out in the Individual Agreement. Operational funding to support the implementation of a Land Code and corresponding laws is generally agreed to every five years for a fixed amount, so it is not guaranteed that a First Nation will always be able to access this funding or to what extent.</p>

</h3>
<p>Ultimately, the aim of the <em>First Nations Land Management Act</em> is to put
reserve land on the global market, subjecting communities to increased
market forces. Under the Framework Agreement First Nations report an
increase in businesses owned by external partners. The political
ideology of neoliberalism, counter to the tenets of many traditional
Indigenous economic philosophies, supports the deregulation of society
through a consolidation of power and profit for corporations, over
human, community needs (not to mention needs of the land). Some
Indigenous scholars identify neoliberalism as a new form of colonization
affecting
Indigenous peoples, which can lead to increasing social inequality.
Instead of the social, political, cultural, legal and economic spheres
interacting in balance within a society, neoliberalism embeds those
spheres in, and under, the economic sphere, and they are seen primarily through that lens.</p>
<p>Many non-Indigenous scholars, however, advocate for neoliberal
conceptions of capital accumulation and corresponding institutions of
governance for Indigenous peoples as an answer to &ldquo;undeveloped&rdquo;
economies. Tom Flanagan, for example, argues that Indigenous peoples'
&ldquo;problem&rdquo; lies in a lack of private property and that &ldquo;as quickly as
possible, Indian bands should receive full ownership of their reserves,
with the right to subdivide, mortgage, sell, and otherwise dispose of
their assets, including buildings, lands, and all natural resources&rdquo;.
Similarly, Hernando De Soto articulates the need for private property
systems in which private property rights are enforced. From this
perspective, land can be used as collateral for economic enterprise.
Manny Jules argues that Indigenous peoples historically had property
rights, and so, others suggest a &ldquo;reinstatement&rdquo; of private property
rights for  First Nations would enable effective integration into the Canadian
economy.</p>
<p>Since the publication of <em>Beyond the Indian Act: Restoring Aboriginal
Property Rights</em>, there have been few published Indigenous nation-specific rebuttals or suggested alternatives that account for a
continuous relationship to territory. Flanagan&rsquo;s main argument within
that text is that First Nations must convert their reserve lands to
fee-simple in order to reach economic independence. This led to the
First Nations Property Ownership Proposal. In 2010, Neskie, Manuel and
Emma Feltes wrote a rebuttal to the campaign for the First Nations
Property Ownership Proposal arguing that it undermines the collective title held by First Nations people and
would effectively result in extinguishment of title. In 2014, Shiri
Pasternak argued that First Nations Property Ownership legislation
was &ldquo;discursively framed to acknowledge Indigenous land rights while the
bill simultaneously introduces contentious measures to individualize and municipalize the quasi-communal  land holding of reserves.&rdquo; Though the First Nations Property Ownership legislation has not been introduced by the federal government, some of the same logics are at play in the First Nations Land Management
Regime.</p>
<p>We have seen a shift to targeting individual First Nations, rather
than blanket legislation when it comes to opening up reserve lands for
development.</p>
<p>It is also important to understand the potential reasons why the federal
government may be interested in the Regime. One reason could be related
to rendering void the fiduciary responsibility that the federal
government holds to First Nations related to the aspects included in the
regime. A second reason could be to open up lands to market interests
for more expedient resource development.  Finally, the Framework Agreement has been shown to generate profits for
Canada.</p>
<p>In a case study research project it was found that for five First
Nation&rsquo;s economic projects examined
(which they called the &ldquo;big winners&rdquo;), the Framework Agreement provides
profits to Canada of &ldquo;between roughly $270 million and 1.4 billion&rdquo;
over the anticipated lifetime of the economic development project.</p>
<p>This increased revenue generated for Canada is due to First Nation&rsquo;s ability to &ldquo;work at the speed of business,&rdquo; meaning it is easier for a First Nation to open businesses on-reserve, work with industry and
forge business relationships with industry which lead to the development
of reserve land.</p>
<p>The increased profits derived from reserve land eventually flow into the
Canadian economy, thereby showing <em>why</em> Canada remains invested in
removing barriers to business on-reserve. Study results show that First
Nations operating within the First Nations Land Management Act report an increase in businesses owned by external partners. But, importantly, First Nations need to be aware of how
the increase in market control may negatively impact their lands and
nations.</p>
<p>We find ourselves at a similar juncture faced by First Nations people
in the 1960&rsquo;s: we are being forced to defend the arcane nature of the
<em>Indian Act</em> in order to protect our current rights.</p>
<p>In 1969, the federal government authored the Statement of the Government
of Canada on Indian Policy, which sought to effectively to abolish the
<em>Indian Act</em>. In the <em>Unjust Society</em>, Harold Cardinal calls this a
&ldquo;thinly disguised programme of extermination through
assimilation&rdquo;.</p>

  Limitations of <em>Indian Act</em> Settler Colonial Governance
  <a class="anchor" href="#limitations-of-indian-act-settler-colonial-governance">#</a>
</h3>
<p>It should be noted that it is band councils elected under the <em>Indian
Act</em> that have the power to opt into the First Nations Land Management
Regime. Though it is generally agreed upon that First Nations need to
able to exert more jurisdiction and control over governance, we are
being offered this increased control through an imposed governance
system, since Canada generally accepts those bestowed power through the
<em>Indian Act</em> as our official representatives. As we know, the <em>Indian
Act</em>, <em>1876</em> had two main purposes, building on the Gradual Civilization
and Enfranchisement Acts that came before it: 1) to assimilate First
Nation individuals until they qualified for enfranchisement into the
Canadian body politic; and 2) to force an exclusively male, British-
style municipal type government onto First Nation communities.
Additionally, the majority of chiefs and councillors elected under the
<em>Indian Act</em> are men. Today, First Nations women are also more likely to
be urban&ndash;having been forced off reserve after successive
discriminatory federal laws&ndash;and therefore while they may be
able to vote as band members to either accept or deny a Land Code put
forward by their leadership, they serve to benefit less from economic
activities on reserve.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to acknowledge that First Nations in Canada
have a diversity of traditional and elected governance systems.
Following arrests of Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en and supporters blocking pre-
construction activities for the Coastal Gaslink pipeline, Trevor Jang
writes &ldquo;the band councils are responsible for managing reserve lands,
while the hereditary system is what governed the broader traditional
territory which is what the pipeline is proposed to cross.&rdquo;
Similarly, nêhiyaw scholar Sylvia McAdam writes that &ldquo;The <em>nêhiyawak</em>
believe the women have jurisdiction over land<br>
and water, which is contrary to the processes of land claims which are
primarily male-dominated chiefs &mdash; elected according to the imposed
<em>Indian Act</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Given this state of affairs, there is an important point to make here:
many First Nations who have implemented a Land Code tout the ability to
create their own laws as a major benefit, but we question to what extent
these reserve land management laws correspond to Indigenous legal
systems.</p>
<p>This alienation of Indigenous peoples from those legal systems is
wrapped up in the dynamics and logics of settler colonialism. We use the
term <em>settler-colonial</em> to refer to the ongoing subjugation that
Indigenous peoples face generally. Settler-colonial logic, related to
the economy, is what Jobin refers to as a double-edged sword. The
first edge is about control&ndash;governing control. One may see this
through the <em>Indian Act</em>, which legislates First Nations people and
communities &ldquo;from cradle to grave.&rdquo; We may see gaining economic
control as an important step towards independence in governance. What is
often missed is the corresponding edge of the blade: that colonialism
has also centred on disrupting and destroying Indigenous economies, and,
specifically, relationships to land. The irony of this logic is that
gaining more freedom from the Canadian government through the First
Nations Land Management Regime or by opening up lands to the market
through economic development, places Indigenous people under the
governance of exploitative global capitalist markets. Boldt argues
that the &ldquo;reserve system was created to clear Indians out of the way of
Canadian economic development&rdquo;. The removal or alienation of
Indigenous peoples from their full territories through the First Nations
Land Management Regime or other processes that enable capitalist
pursuits produces analogous results. It is clear that the First Nations
Land Management Regime exists because of this logic.</p>
<p>The wealth disparity between First Nations people and settlers will only truly be resolved when we gain access and control over greater lands and resources.</p>
