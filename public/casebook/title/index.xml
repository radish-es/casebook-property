      <title>Basic Estates and Future Interests</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We will begin by examining two possessory estates—the &lt;strong&gt;fee simple absolute&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;life estate&lt;/strong&gt;—and two future interests &amp;hellip; —the &lt;strong&gt;reversion&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;remainder&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-fee-simple-absolute&#34;&gt;&#xA;  The Fee Simple Absolute&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#the-fee-simple-absolute&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fee simple absolute is the most complete interest in land that the law will recognize. When we say that “O owns Greenacre without any further qualification, what we actually mean is that O owns a presently possessory fee simple absolute in Greenacre. The key distinguishing characteristic of the fee simple absolute is that it has no inherent end—it is an estate of indefinite duration. It is descendible, devisable, and alienable inter vivos; so it can be transferred to a new owner, but it cannot be destroyed. At most, it can be carved up into lesser estates and interests for a while, and we will spend most of the rest of this chapter understanding how that happens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

On second reading of the proposed legislation, the Honourable W. S. Kennedy Jones stated:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this legislation is to provide a simpler and less expensive machinery for the clarification of titles within areas or communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second section of the Act is the definition section, and therein the minister is defined as being the Minister of Lands and Forests, and I perhaps should point out that my particular interest in the preparation and presentation of the present legislation is as the chairman of the Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I am of opinion that it is not. The will of Donald Chisholm after devising his farm of 100 acres to his two sons William and Hugh in fee and equally dividing it between them, contained the following provision:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He directed that the income from the property transferred and assigned by him to the trust (the “trust property” or “trust fund”) be used for the purpose of educational scholarships, to be called “The Leonard Scholarships”. The Canada Trust Company has been appointed successor trustee of the Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For the purpose of the claim, this area was divided into 133 individual territories, claimed by the 71 Houses. This represents all of the Wet&amp;rsquo;suwet&amp;rsquo;en people, and all but 12 of the Gitksan Houses. Their claim was originally for &amp;ldquo;ownership&amp;rdquo; of the territory and &amp;ldquo;jurisdiction&amp;rdquo; over it. (At this Court, this was transformed into, primarily, a claim for aboriginal title over the land in question.) The province of British Columbia counterclaimed for a declaration that the appellants have no right or interest in and to the territory or alternatively, that the appellants&amp;rsquo; cause of action ought to be for compensation from the Government of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;fisher-j--&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Fisher, J. -&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#fisher-j--&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs, who are beneficiaries under the will of William Duthie, deceased, complain, &lt;em&gt;inter alia&lt;/em&gt;, of a breach of trust on the part of the defendants as executors and trustees under the will in omitting to sell the testamentary property when it might have been sold at a good price and retaining it and paying taxes thereon for a while until part of it (some eleven acres) was finally lost at a tax sale and the rest or the portion thereof unsold has become so depreciated in value that the estate, which was estimated to have had a net value of approximately, $21,000 at the time of the death of the testator in September, 1911, is now apparently at best little more than solvent. In reply the defendant Gallagher, who has been the active executor (the co-executor being now a man over 80 years of age), first calls attention to a fact which I think should be taken into consideration under the circumstances here where such a devastavit as aforesaid is alleged, &lt;em&gt;viz.&lt;/em&gt;, that since the death of the deceased, the plaintiffs, being the widow (who married again in 1912) and the children while infants, have lived rent free on the most salable part of the estate being one of the Burnaby properties consisting of about five acres and have also had certain rents from time to time therefrom. Attention has also been called to the fact admitted by the plaintiffs that the widow did not wish this part of the property sold and apparently the other plaintiffs since coming of age have all approved of the use being made of this portion of the estate though in the last paragraph of the will the testator directs that in the event of his wife marrying again his trustees should use the income for the benefit of the daughters (only).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Duty to Consult</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You will note that in the final paragraphs excerpted from &lt;em&gt;Tsilhqot&amp;rsquo;in Nation&lt;/em&gt;, the Supreme Court found that the Province of British Columbia breached its duty to consult with the Tsilhqot&amp;rsquo;in Nation prior to granting forestry licences to third parties on territorial lands. That duty was engaged when the Province began the planning process for removing timber on the land.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An important point here is that the Crown owed and breached its duty to consult with the Tsilhqot&amp;rsquo;in Nation well &lt;em&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; to the Tsilhqot&amp;rsquo;in Nation  successfully proving their claim in the courts. This is a central purpose of the consultation doctrine: it engages the Crown&amp;rsquo;s fiduciary duty and the honour of the Crown in advance of litigation or negotiations to address claims to title, and therefore offers some measure of protection for title lands in light of the several legal and other barriers to successfully resolving such claims.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;This case concerns the lease of reserve lands situated within the geographical boundaries of the City of Vancouver. In 1957, members of the Musqueam Indian Band voted to surrender 162 acres of their reserve lands to the federal Crown on the understanding that these lands would in turn be leased by the Crown to the Shaughnessy Heights Golf Club for use as a golf course. Rents and other benefits from this lease were to be paid to Band. The final terms on which the Crown ultimately leased the lands to Shaughnessy Heights, however, were very unfavourable to the Band. The Chief and Councillors of the Musqueam Indian Band sued the Crown for breach of trust and damages in the amount of $10,000,000.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Introduction to Trusts</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/casebook/title/trusts-intro/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/casebook/title/trusts-intro/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The origin of the trust lies in medieval tax estate planning and tax evasion. (Arguably, nothing has changed in the last six hundred years.) Imagine Osbert, a minor lord in the 15th century, who holds Greenacre as a tenant of Leonard, a slightly less minor lord. Osbert is getting on in years and has started to worry about the future of his family. His elder son, Aylwin, is not showing promising signs of maturity, and Osbert has come to think that Aylwin may be better suited to religious orders than the duties of managing a great estate. But Osbert’s younger son Bartholomew appears to be a fine young gentleman: athletic, patient, and wise in the ways of men. Osbert would like to provide for Aylwin, but would prefer to have Greenacre go to Bartholomew. Osbert’s problem is that the available conveyancing devices don’t work for him. If he does nothing, then Greenacre goes to Alywin at Osbert’s death under the rule of primogeniture in effect in England at the time, according to which the eldest son receives any land his father owned at his death (was “seised of,” in contemporary terminology). A will leaving Greenacre to Bartholomew doesn’t work because land could not be devised by will until the Statute of Wills in 1540. And Osbert doesn’t want to convey Greenacre (or a future interest in Greenacre) to Bartholomew now, because Bartholomew might die before him, or Aylwin might get his act together, or something else could come along to force a change in plan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The first suppliant is a British subject by naturalization, the second a British subject by birth, and the suppliants in the third petition are Japanese nationals. The questions of law were heard together, the circumstances being such that the answer in any one case will be equally applicable in the others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Overview - The St. Catherine&#39;s Milling Case</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For more than a hundred years after it was enacted, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 stood as the British Crown&amp;rsquo;s most authoritative statement on Aboriginal title. But during this period the Proclamation itself received little to no scrutiny in the common law courts. This changed dramatically when the Chancery Division of the High Court of Ontario issued its decision in &lt;em&gt;St. Catherine&amp;rsquo;s Milling and Lumber Co. v R&lt;/em&gt; in 1886, followed by subsequent appeals all the way to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council—at that time, Canada&amp;rsquo;s highest court of appeal. The case would chart the course for the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title in Canada for well into the next century.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At the time of his death his estate amounted to approximately $16,000. By his will he provided as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Central to this context is the right to &lt;em&gt;alienate&lt;/em&gt; property and the power of owners to place restrictions on alienability. Recall that we have already encountered alienation and restraints on alienation in the context of Aboriginal title going back to the Royal Proclamation in 1763. As we learn this week, the extent to which landowners can and should be able transfer their property rights to others and to place limits on alienation has long raised some pervasive controversies in common law property.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The governments of&#xA;Canada, Manitoba, and Ontario decided to create a water reservoir in&#xA;northern Ontario to power hydroelectricity generation. They settled on&#xA;Lac Seul, which flows into both Ontario and Manitoba, and determined&#xA;that if they raised the water level of Lac Seul by 10 feet, or&#xA;approximately 3 metres, they could generate substantial electricity.&#xA;Construction of the dam was completed in 1929 and the water steadily&#xA;rose through the 1930s. The project was a success for the three&#xA;governments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tenure and Estates</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/casebook/title/tenure/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/casebook/title/tenure/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to the common law doctrine of tenure all land under the dominion of the English crown is held “mediately or immediately, of the king”—that is, the crown has “radical title” to all land under its political dominion. William the Conqueror declared that all land in England was literally the king’s property; everyone else had to settle for the privilege of holding it for him—the privilege of &lt;em&gt;tenure&lt;/em&gt; (from the Norman French word “tenir”—to hold). Tenurial rights were intensely personal in early feudal society: the right to hold land was a privilege granted by the crown in exchange for an oath of allegiance and a promise of military service by the tenant—the oath of homage. The word homage derives from the French word &lt;em&gt;homme&lt;/em&gt;—literally “man”—precisely because the ceremony surrounding the oath created not only the right of tenure, but a political and military relationship between “lord and man.”  In exchange for the tenant’s loyal support, or &lt;em&gt;fealty&lt;/em&gt;, the lord warranted the tenant’s right to hold a plot of land, called a fief, or &lt;em&gt;fee&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Unlawful Dispossession of Japanese Canadians</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/casebook/title/adams-stangerross/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While interning Japanese Canadians, the federal government seized control of all of their real and personal property within the &amp;ldquo;protected area in British Columbia.&amp;rdquo; In the spring of 1943, federal officials began to sell virtually everything that the government had taken, often below market value. Families lost heirlooms, vibrant businesses, and everyday possessions. They lost cars, boats, books, toys, furniture, and cameras. They lost homes and farms. Beyond the tangible, Canadians of Japanese descent lost opportunities, neighbourhoods, and communities. They lost connections to place. They lost retirements, livelihoods, and educations. They lost agency over their property and life choices. They lost, as Rikizo Yoneyama poignantly expressed in a defiant letter to the Minister of Justice, &amp;ldquo;more than just a home.&amp;rdquo; Japanese Canadians, he lamented, lost &amp;ldquo;the foundation of security and freedom as Canadian citizens.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Introduction&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#i-introduction&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is the test for Aboriginal title to land? If title is established, what rights does it confer? Does the British Columbia &lt;em&gt;Forest Act&lt;/em&gt;, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 157, apply to land covered by Aboriginal title? What are the constitutional constraints on provincial regulation of land under Aboriginal title? Finally, how are broader public interests to be reconciled with the rights conferred by Aboriginal title? These are among the important questions raised by this appeal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Downey&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Beals&lt;/em&gt;, above, discuss some of the history behind African Nova Scotian settlement in the province and describe how the &lt;em&gt;LTCA&lt;/em&gt; and its predecessor legislation was enacted to transform possessory rights into formal land titles. One prominent idea in these cases is that the lack of clear land title is a central cause of economic underdevelopment in African Nova Scotian communities&amp;ndash;and is one that can be adequately remedied through legal processes designed to recognize and formalize longstanding possessory rights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
