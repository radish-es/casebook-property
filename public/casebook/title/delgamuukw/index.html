  A. The Claim at Trial
  #

This action was commenced by the appellants, who are all Gitksan or Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en hereditary chiefs, who, both individually and on behalf of their &ldquo;Houses&rdquo; claimed separate portions of 58,000 square kilometres in British Columbia. For the purpose of the claim, this area was divided into 133 individual territories, claimed by the 71 Houses. This represents all of the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en people, and all but 12 of the Gitksan Houses. Their claim was originally for &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; of the territory and &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; over it. (At this Court, this was transformed into, primarily, a claim for aboriginal title over the land in question.) The province of British Columbia counterclaimed for a declaration that the appellants have no right or interest in and to the territory or alternatively, that the appellants&rsquo; cause of action ought to be for compensation from the Government of Canada.">

  A. The Claim at Trial
  <a class="anchor" href="#a-the-claim-at-trial">#</a>
</h4>
<p>This action was commenced by the appellants, who are all Gitksan or Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en hereditary chiefs, who, both individually and on behalf of their &ldquo;Houses&rdquo; claimed separate portions of 58,000 square kilometres in British Columbia. For the purpose of the claim, this area was divided into 133 individual territories, claimed by the 71 Houses. This represents all of the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en people, and all but 12 of the Gitksan Houses. Their claim was originally for &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; of the territory and &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; over it. (At this Court, this was transformed into, primarily, a claim for aboriginal title over the land in question.) The province of British Columbia counterclaimed for a declaration that the appellants have no right or interest in and to the territory or alternatively, that the appellants&rsquo; cause of action ought to be for compensation from the Government of Canada.</p>

</h4>
<h5 id="1-demography">
  (1) Demography
  <a class="anchor" href="#1-demography">#</a>
</h5>
<p>The Gitksan consist of approximately 4,000 to 5,000 persons, most of whom now live in the territory claimed, which is generally the watersheds of the north and central Skeena, Nass and Babine Rivers and their tributaries. The Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en consist of approximately 1500 to 2000 persons, who also predominantly live in the territory claimed. This territory is mainly in the watersheds of the Bulkley and parts of the Fraser - Nechako River systems and their tributaries. It lies immediately east and south of the Gitksan.</p>
<p>Of course, the Gitksan and Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en are not the only people living in the claimed territory. As noted by both McEachern C.J. at trial (at p. 440) and Lambert J.A. on appeal (at p. 243), there are other aboriginals who live in the claimed territory, notably the Carrier-Sekani and Nishga peoples. Some of these people have unsettled land claims overlapping with the territory at issue here. Moreover, there are also numerous non-aboriginals living there. McEachern C.J. found that, at the time of the trial, the non-aboriginal population in the territory was over 30,000.</p>
<h5 id="2-history">
  (2) History
  <a class="anchor" href="#2-history">#</a>
</h5>
<p>There were numerous theories of the history of the Gitksan and Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en peoples before the trial judge. His conclusion from the evidence was that their ancestors migrated from Asia, probably through Alaska, and spread south and west into the areas which they found to be liveable. There was archeological evidence, which he accepted, that there was some form of human habitation in the territory and its surrounding areas from 3500 to 6000 years ago, and intense occupation of the Hagwilget Canyon site (near Hazelton), prior to about 4000 to 3500 years ago. This occupation was mainly in or near villages on the Skeena River, the Babine River or the Bulkley River, where salmon, the staple of their diet, was easily obtainable. The other parts of the territory surrounding and between their villages and rivers were used for hunting and gathering for both food and ceremonial purposes. The scope of this hunting and gathering area depended largely on the availability of the required materials in the areas around the villages. Prior to the commencement of the fur trade, there was no reason to travel far from the villages for anything other than their subsistence requirements.</p>

  (3) North American Exploration
  <a class="anchor" href="#3-north-american-exploration">#</a>
</h5>
<p>There was little European influence in western Canada until the arrival of Capt. Cook at Nootka on Vancouver Island in 1778, which led to the sea otter hunt in the north Pacific. This influence grew with the establishment of the first Hudson&rsquo;s Bay trading post west of the Rockies (although east of the territories claimed) by Simon Fraser in 1805-1806. Trapping for the commercial fur trade was not an aboriginal practice, but rather one influenced by European contact. The trial judge held that the time of direct contact between the Aboriginal Peoples in the claimed territory was approximately 1820, after the trader William Brown arrived and Hudson&rsquo;s Bay had merged with the North West Company.</p>
<h5 id="4-present-social-organization">
  (4) Present Social Organization
  <a class="anchor" href="#4-present-social-organization">#</a>
</h5>
<p>McEachern C.J. set out a description of the present social organization of the appellants. In his opinion, this was necessary because &ldquo;one of the ingredients of aboriginal land claims is that they arise from long-term communal rather than personal use or possession of land&rdquo; (at p. 147). The fundamental premise of both the Gitksan and the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en people is that they are divided into clans and Houses. Every person born of a Gitksan or Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en woman is automatically a member of his or her mother&rsquo;s House and clan. There are four Gitksan and four Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en clans, which are subdivided into houses. Each house has one or more Hereditary Chief as its titular head, selected by the elders of their house, as well as possibly the Head Chief of the other Houses of the clan. There is no head chief for the clans, but there is a ranking order of precedence within communities or villages, where one House or clan may be more prominent than others.</p>
<p>At trial, the appellants&rsquo; claim was based on their historical use and &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; of one or more of the territories. The trial judge held that these are marked, in some cases, by physical and tangible indicators of their association with the territories. He cited as examples totem poles with the Houses&rsquo; crests carved, or distinctive regalia. In addition, the Gitksan houses have an &ldquo;adaawk&rdquo; which is a collection of sacred oral tradition about their ancestors, histories and territories. The Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en each have a &ldquo;kungax&rdquo; which is a spiritual song or dance or performance which ties them to their land. Both of these were entered as evidence on behalf of the appellants (see my discussion of the trial judge&rsquo;s view of this evidence, infra).</p>
<p>The most significant evidence of spiritual connection between the Houses and their territory is a feast hall. This is where the Gitksan and Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en people tell and re-tell their stories and identify their territories to remind themselves of the sacred connection that they have with their lands. The feast has a ceremonial purpose, but is also used for making important decisions. The trial judge also noted the Criminal Code prohibition on aboriginal feast ceremonies, which existed until 1951.</p>
<p>[<em>After reviewing the history of the case at trial and at the British Columbia Court of Appeal, Chief Justice Lamer went on to address a procedural defect in the appellants&rsquo; pleadings. The appellants on behalf of the Gitksan and Wet’suwet’en nations had initially made a claim for recognition of &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; and &ldquo;jurisdiction&rdquo; over their territorial lands. On appeal, the claimants had changed these to claims ones for a declaration of &ldquo;Aboriginal title&rdquo; and &ldquo;self-government&rdquo; respectively. No formal amendments had ever been made to the pleadings, however—a situation which British Columbia argued introduced significant prejudice. Chief Justice Lamer agreed and therefore decline to resolve the case on its merits. Nevertheless, the Court took the opportunity in Delgamuukw to elaborate in much more detail that it had previously the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title.</em>]</p>

<p>The parties disagree over whether the appellants have established aboriginal title to the disputed area. However, since those factual issues require a new trial, we cannot resolve that dispute in this appeal. But factual issues aside, the parties also have a more fundamental disagreement over the content of aboriginal title itself, and its reception into the Constitution by s. 35(1). In order to give guidance to the judge at the new trial, it is to this issue that I will now turn.</p>
<p>I set out these opposing positions by way of illustration and introduction because I believe that all of the parties have characterized the content of aboriginal title incorrectly. The appellants argue that aboriginal title is tantamount to an inalienable fee simple, which confers on aboriginal peoples the rights to use those lands as they choose and which has been constitutionalized by s. 35(1). The respondents offer two alternative formulations: first, that aboriginal title is no more than a bundle of rights to engage in activities which are themselves aboriginal rights recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1), and that the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em>, merely constitutionalizes those individual rights, not the bundle itself, because the latter has no independent content; and second, that aboriginal title, at most, encompasses the right to exclusive use and occupation of land in order to engage in those activities which are aboriginal rights themselves, and that s. 35(1) constitutionalizes this notion of exclusivity.</p>
<p>The content of aboriginal title, in fact, lies somewhere in between these positions. Aboriginal title is a right in land and, as such, is more than the right to engage in specific activities which may be themselves aboriginal rights. Rather, it confers the right to use land for a variety of activities, not all of which need be aspects of practices, customs and traditions which are integral to the distinctive cultures of aboriginal societies. Those activities do not constitute the right <em>per se</em>; rather, they are parasitic on the underlying title. However, that range of uses is subject to the limitation that they must not be irreconcilable with the nature of the attachment to the land which forms the basis of the particular group’s aboriginal title. This inherent limit, to be explained more fully below, flows from the definition of aboriginal title as a <em>sui generis</em> interest in land, and is one way in which aboriginal title is distinct from a fee simple.</p>

</h5>
<p>The starting point of the Canadian jurisprudence on aboriginal title is the Privy Council’s decision in <em>St. Catharines Milling &amp; Lumber Co. v. R.</em> (1888), 14 App. Cas. 46 (Canada P.C.),<a href="http://nextcanada.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&amp;pubNum=6407&amp;serNum=1889326276&amp;originationContext=document&amp;transitionType=DocumentItem&amp;vr=3.0&amp;rs=cblt1.0&amp;contextData=%28sc.Default%29" target="_blank" > </a> which described aboriginal title as a “personal and usufructuary right” (at p.54). The subsequent jurisprudence has attempted to grapple with this definition, and has in the process demonstrated that the Privy Council’s choice of terminology is not particularly helpful to explain the various dimensions of aboriginal title. What the Privy Council sought to capture is that aboriginal title is a <em>sui generis</em> interest in land. Aboriginal title has been described as <em>sui generis</em> in order to distinguish it from “normal” proprietary interests, such as fee simple. However, as I will now develop, it is also <em>sui generis</em> in the sense that its characteristics cannot be completely explained by reference either to the common law rules of real property or to the rules of property found in aboriginal legal systems. As with other aboriginal rights, it must be understood by reference to both common law and aboriginal perspectives.</p>
<p>The idea that aboriginal title is <em>sui generis</em> is the unifying principle underlying the various dimensions of that title. One dimension is its <em>inalienability</em>. Lands held pursuant to aboriginal title cannot be transferred, sold or surrendered to anyone other than the Crown and, as a result, is inalienable to third parties. This Court has taken pains to clarify that aboriginal title is only “personal” in this sense, and does not mean that aboriginal title is a non-proprietary interest which amounts to no more than a licence to use and occupy the land and cannot compete on an equal footing with other proprietary interests: see <em>Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Paul</em>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 654 (S.C.C.) at p. 677.</p>
<p>Another dimension of aboriginal title is its source. It had originally been thought that the source of aboriginal title in Canada was the <em>Royal Proclamation, 1763</em>: see <em>St. Catharines Milling</em>. However, it is now clear that although aboriginal title was recognized by the <em>Proclamation</em>, it arises from the prior occupation of Canada by aboriginal peoples. That prior occupation, however, is relevant in two different ways, both of which illustrate the <em>sui generis</em> nature of aboriginal title. The first is the physical fact of occupation, which derives from the common law principle that occupation is proof of possession in law: see Kent McNeil, <em>Common Law Aboriginal Title</em>(1989), at p. 7. Thus, in <em>Guerin</em>, <em>supra</em>, Dickson J. described aboriginal title, at p. 376, as a “legal right derived from the Indians’ historic occupation and possession of their tribal lands”. What makes aboriginal title <em>sui generis</em> is that it arises from possession before the assertion of British sovereignty, whereas normal estates, like fee simple, arise afterward: see Kent McNeil, “The Meaning of Aboriginal Title”, in Michael Asch, ed., <em>Aboriginal and Treaty Rights in Canada</em> (1997), 135, at p. 144. This idea has been further developed in <em>Wewayakum Indian Band v. Canada</em>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 322 (S.C.C.),  where this Court unanimously held at p.340 that “aboriginal title pre-dated colonization by the British and survived British claims to sovereignty” (also see <em>Guerin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at p.378).  What this suggests is a second source for aboriginal title — the relationship between common law and pre-existing systems of aboriginal law.</p>
<p>A further dimension of aboriginal title is the fact that it is held <em>communally</em>. Aboriginal title cannot be held by individual aboriginal persons; it is a collective right to land held by all members of an aboriginal nation. Decisions with respect to that land are also made by that community. This is another feature of aboriginal title which is <em>sui generis</em> and distinguishes it from normal property interests.</p>
<h5 id="b-the-content-of-aboriginal-title">
  (b) The content of aboriginal title
  <a class="anchor" href="#b-the-content-of-aboriginal-title">#</a>
</h5>
<p>Although cases involving aboriginal title have come before this Court and Privy Council before, there has never been a definitive statement from either court on the content of aboriginal title. In <em>St. Catharines Milling</em>, the Privy Council, as I have mentioned, described the aboriginal title as a “personal and usufructuary interest”, but declined to explain what that meant because it was not “necessary to express any opinion on the point” (at p.55). Similarly, in <em>Calder</em>, <em>Guerin</em>, and <em>Paul</em>, the issues were the extinguishment of, the fiduciary duty arising from the surrender of, and statutory easements over land held pursuant to, aboriginal title, respectively; the content of title was not at issue and was not directly addressed.</p>
<p>Although the courts have been less than forthcoming, I have arrived at the conclusion that the content of aboriginal title can be summarized by two propositions: first, that aboriginal title encompasses the right to exclusive use and occupation of the land held pursuant to that title for a variety of purposes, which need not be aspects of those aboriginal practices, customs and traditions which are integral to distinctive aboriginal cultures; and second, that those protected uses must not be irreconcilable with the nature of the group’s attachment to that land. For the sake of clarity, I will discuss each of these propositions separately.</p>
<p><em>Aboriginal title encompasses the right to use the land held pursuant to that title for a variety of purposes, which need not be aspects of those aboriginal practices, cultures and traditions which are integral to distinctive aboriginal cultures.</em></p>
<p>The respondents argue that aboriginal title merely encompasses the right to engage in activities which are aspects of aboriginal practices, customs and traditions which are integral to distinctive aboriginal cultures of the aboriginal group claiming the right and, at most, adds the notion of exclusivity; i.e., the exclusive right to use the land for those purposes. However, the uses to which lands held pursuant to aboriginal title can be put are not restricted in this way. This conclusion emerges from three sources: (i) the Canadian jurisprudence on aboriginal title, (ii) the relationship between reserve lands and lands held pursuant to aboriginal title, and (iii) the <em>Indian Oil and Gas Act</em>, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-7. As well, although this is not legally determinative, it is supported by the critical literature. In particular, I have profited greatly from Professor McNeil’s article, “The Meaning of Aboriginal Title”, supra.</p>

  (i) Canadian jurisprudence on aboriginal title
  <a class="anchor" href="#i-canadian-jurisprudence-on-aboriginal-title">#</a>
</h6>
<p>Despite the fact that the jurisprudence on aboriginal title is somewhat underdeveloped, it is clear that the uses to which lands held pursuant to aboriginal title can be put is not restricted to the practices, customs and traditions of aboriginal peoples integral to distinctive aboriginal cultures. In <em>Guerin</em>, for example, Dickson J. described aboriginal title as “an interest in land” which encompassed “a legal right to occupy and possess certain lands” (at p. 382). The “right to occupy and possess” is framed in broad terms and, significantly, is not qualified by reference to traditional and customary uses of those lands. Any doubt that the right to occupancy and possession encompasses a broad variety of uses of land was put to rest in <em>Paul</em>, where the Court went even further and stated that aboriginal title was “more than the right to enjoyment and occupancy” (at p. 688). Once again, there is no reference to aboriginal practices, customs and traditions as a qualifier on that right. Moreover, I take the reference to “more” as emphasis of the broad notion of use and possession.</p>
<h6 id="ii-reserve-land">
  (ii) Reserve Land
  <a class="anchor" href="#ii-reserve-land">#</a>
</h6>
<p>Another source of support for the conclusion that the uses to which lands held under aboriginal title can be put are not restricted to those grounded in practices, customs and traditions integral to distinctive aboriginal cultures can be found in <em>Guerin</em>, where Dickson J. stated at p.379 that the same legal principles governed the aboriginal interest in reserve lands and lands held pursuant to aboriginal title:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It does not matter, in my opinion, that the present case is concerned with the interest of an Indian Band in a reserve rather than with unrecognized aboriginal title in traditional tribal lands. <em>The Indian interest in the lands is the same in both cases</em>….. [Emphasis added.]</p></blockquote>
<p>The nature of the Indian interest in reserve land is very broad, and can found in s. 18 of the <em>Indian Act</em>, which I reproduce in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>18.(1) Subject to this Act, reserves are held by Her Majesty for the <em>use and benefit</em> of the respective bands for which they were set apart, and subject to this Act and to the terms of any treaty or surrender, the Governor in Council may determine whether any purpose for which lands in a reserve are used or are to be used is for the use and benefit of the band.</p>
<p>(2) The Minister may authorize the use of lands in a reserve for the purpose of Indian schools, the administration of Indian affairs, Indian burial grounds, Indian health projects or, with the consent of the council of the band, <em>for any other purpose for the general welfare of the band</em>, and may take any lands in a reserve required for those purposes, but where an individual Indian, immediately prior to the taking, was entitled to the possession of those lands, compensation for that use shall be paid to the Indian, in such amount as may be agreed between the Indian and the Minister, or, failing agreement, as may be determined in such manner as the Minister may direct. [Emphasis added.]</p></blockquote>
<p>The principal provision is s. 18(1), which states that reserve lands are held “for the use and benefit” of the bands which occupy them; those uses and benefits, on the face of the <em>Indian Act</em>, do not appear to be restricted to practices, customs and traditions integral to distinctive aboriginal cultures. The breadth of those uses is reinforced by s. 18(2), which states that reserve lands may be used “for any other purpose for the general welfare of the band”. The general welfare of the band has not been defined in terms of aboriginal practices, customs and traditions, nor in terms of those activities which have their origin pre-contact; it is a concept, by definition, which incorporates a reference to the present-day needs of aboriginal communities. On the basis of <em>Guerin</em>, lands held pursuant to aboriginal title, like reserve lands, are also capable of being used for a broad variety of purposes.</p>
<h6 id="iii-indian-oil-and-gas-act">
  (iii) Indian Oil and Gas Act
  <a class="anchor" href="#iii-indian-oil-and-gas-act">#</a>
</h6>
<p>The third source for the proposition that the content of aboriginal title is not restricted to practices, customs, and traditions which are integral to distinctive aboriginal cultures is the <em>Indian Oil and Gas Act</em>. The overall purpose of the statute is to provide for the exploration of oil and gas on reserve lands through their surrender to the Crown. The statute presumes that the aboriginal interest in reserve land includes mineral rights, a point which this Court unanimously accepted with respect to the *Indian Act in Apsassin v. Canada *(<em>Department of Indian Affairs &amp; Northern Development</em>),[1995] 4 S.C.R. 344 (S.C.C.). On the basis of <em>Guerin</em>, aboriginal title also encompass mineral rights, and lands held pursuant to aboriginal title should be capable of exploitation in the same way, which is certainly not a traditional use for those lands. This conclusion is reinforced by s. 6(2) of the Act, which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>6 … (2) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to abrogate the rights of Indian people or preclude them from negotiating for oil and gas benefits in those areas in which land claims have not been settled.</p></blockquote>
<p>The areas referred to in s. 6(2), at the very least, must encompass lands held pursuant to aboriginal title, since those lands by definition have not been surrendered under land claims agreements. The presumption underlying s. 6(2) is that aboriginal title permits the development of oil and gas reserves.</p>
<p>Although this is not determinative, the conclusion that the content of aboriginal title is not restricted to those uses with their origins in the practices, customs and traditions integral to distinctive aboriginal societies has wide support in the critical literature: Jocelyn Gagne, “The Content of Aboriginal Title at Common Law: A Look at the Nishga Claim” (1982-83), 47 <em>Sask. Law Rev.</em> 309 at pp. 336-37; Kent McNeil, <em>Common Law Aboriginal Title</em>, <em>supra</em>, at p. 242; Kent McNeil, “The Meaning of Aboriginal Title”, <em>supra</em>, at pp. 143-150; William Pentney, “The Rights of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada in the <em>Constitution Act</em>, 1982 Part II — Section 35: The Substantive Guarantee” (1988), 22 <em>U.B.C. Law Rev.</em> 207, at pp. 221; <em>Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples</em>, vol. 2, <em>Restructuring the Relationship</em>, at pp. 561; Brian Slattery, “The Constitutional Guarantee of Aboriginal and Treaty Rights” (1982-83), 8 <em>Queen’s L.J.</em> 232, at pp. 268-9; Brian Slattery, <em>Ancestral Lands, Alien Laws: Judicial Perspectives on Aboriginal Title</em> (1983) at pp. 34; Brian Slattery, “Understanding Aboriginal Rights”, <em>supra</em>, at pp. 746-48.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the content of aboriginal title is not restricted to those uses which are elements of a practice, custom or tradition integral to the distinctive culture of the aboriginal group claiming the right. However, nor does aboriginal title amount to a form of inalienable fee simple, as I will now explain.</p>
<h5 id="c-inherent-limit">
  (c) Inherent Limit
  <a class="anchor" href="#c-inherent-limit">#</a>
</h5>
<p>The content of aboriginal title contains an inherent limit that lands held pursuant to title cannot be used in a manner that is irreconcilable with the nature of the claimants’ attachment to those lands. This limit on the content of aboriginal title is a manifestation of the principle that underlies the various dimensions of that special interest in land &ndash; it is a <em>sui generis</em> interest that is distinct from “normal” proprietary interests, most notably fee simple.</p>
<p>I arrive at this conclusion by reference to the other dimensions of aboriginal title which are <em>sui generis</em> as well. I first consider the source of aboriginal title. As I discussed earlier, aboriginal title arises from the prior occupation of Canada by aboriginal peoples. That prior occupation is relevant in two different ways: first, because of the physical fact of occupation, and second, because aboriginal title originates in part from pre-existing systems of aboriginal law. However, the law of aboriginal title does not only seek to determine the historic rights of aboriginal peoples to land; it also seeks to afford legal protection to prior occupation in the present-day. Implicit in the protection of historic patterns of occupation is a recognition of the importance of the continuity of the relationship of an aboriginal community to its land over time.</p>
<p>I develop this point below with respect to the test for aboriginal title. The relevance of the continuity of the relationship of an aboriginal community with its land here is that it applies not only to the past, but to the future as well. That relationship should not be prevented from continuing into the future. As a result, uses of the lands that would threaten that future relationship are, by their very nature, excluded from the content of aboriginal title.</p>
<p>Accordingly, in my view, lands subject to aboriginal title cannot be put to such uses as may be irreconcilable with the nature of the occupation of that land and the relationship that the particular group has had with the land which together have given rise to aboriginal title in the first place. As discussed below, one of the critical elements in the determination of whether a particular aboriginal group has aboriginal title to certain lands is the matter of the occupancy of those lands. Occupancy is determined by reference to the activities that have taken place on the land and the uses to which the land has been put by the particular group. If lands are so occupied, there will exist a special bond between the group and the land in question such that the land will be part of the definition of the group’s distinctive culture. It seems to me that these elements of aboriginal title create an inherent limitation on the uses to which the land, over which such title exists, may be put. For example, if occupation is established with reference to the use of the land as a hunting ground, then the group that successfully claims aboriginal title to that land may not use it in such a fashion as to destroy its value for such a use (e.g., by strip mining it). Similarly, if a group claims a special bond with the land because of its ceremonial or cultural significance, it may not use the land in such a way as to destroy that relationship (e.g., by developing it in such a way that the bond is destroyed, perhaps by turning it into a parking lot).</p>
<p>It is for this reason also that lands held by virtue of aboriginal title may not be alienated. Alienation would bring to an end the entitlement of the aboriginal people to occupy the land and would terminate their relationship with it. I have suggested above that the inalienability of aboriginal lands is, at least in part, a function of the common law principle that settlers in colonies must derive their title from Crown grant and, therefore, cannot acquire title through purchase from aboriginal inhabitants. It is also, again only in part, a function of a general policy “to ensure that Indians are not dispossessed of their entitlements”: see <em>Mitchell v. Sandy Bay Indian Band</em>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 85 (S.C.C.) at p. 133. What the inalienability of lands held pursuant to aboriginal title suggests is that those lands are more than just a fungible commodity. The relationship between an aboriginal community and the lands over which it has aboriginal title has an important non-economic component. The land has an inherent and unique value in itself, which is enjoyed by the community with aboriginal title to it. The community cannot put the land to uses which would destroy that value.</p>
<p>I am cognizant that the <em>sui generis</em> nature of aboriginal title precludes the application of “traditional real property rules” to elucidate the content of that title (<em>St. Mary’s Indian Band v. Cranbrook (City)</em>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 657 (S.C.C.) at para. 14). Nevertheless, a useful analogy can be drawn between the limit on aboriginal title and the concept of equitable waste at common law. Under that doctrine, persons who hold a life estate in real property cannot commit “wanton or extravagant acts of destruction” (E. H. Burn, <em>Cheshire and Burn’s Modern Law of Real Property</em> (14th ed. 1988), at p. 264) or “ruin the property” (Robert E. Megarry and H. W. R. Wade, <em>The Law of Real Property</em>, 4th ed. (1975) at p. 105). This description of the limits imposed by the doctrine of equitable waste capture the kind of limit I have in mind here.</p>
<p>Finally, what I have just said regarding the importance of the continuity of the relationship between an aboriginal community and its land, and the non-economic or inherent value of that land, should not be taken to detract from the possibility of surrender to the Crown in exchange for valuable consideration. On the contrary, the idea of surrender reinforces the conclusion that aboriginal title is limited in the way I have described. If aboriginal peoples wish to use their lands in a way that aboriginal title does not permit, then they must surrender those lands and convert them into non-title lands to do so.</p>
<p>The foregoing amounts to a general limitation on the use of lands held by virtue of aboriginal title. It arises from the particular physical and cultural relationship that a group may have with the land and is defined by the source of aboriginal title over it. This is not, I must emphasize, a limitation that restricts the use of the land to those activities that have traditionally been carried out on it. That would amount to a legal straitjacket on aboriginal peoples who have a legitimate legal claim to the land. The approach I have outlined above allows for a full range of uses of the land, subject only to an overarching limit, defined by the special nature of the aboriginal title in that land.</p>
<h5 id="d-aboriginal-title-under-s-351-of-the-constitution-act-1982">
  (d) Aboriginal title under s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982
  <a class="anchor" href="#d-aboriginal-title-under-s-351-of-the-constitution-act-1982">#</a>
</h5>
<p>Aboriginal title at common law is protected in its full form by s. 35(1). This conclusion flows from the express language of s. 35(1) itself, which states in full: “[t]he <em>existing</em> aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed” (emphasis added). On a plain reading of the provision, s. 35(1) did not create aboriginal rights; rather, it accorded constitutional status to those rights which were “existing” in 1982. The provision, at the very least, constitutionalized those rights which aboriginal peoples possessed at common law, since those rights existed at the time s. 35(1) came into force. Since aboriginal title was a common law right whose existence was recognized well before 1982 (e.g., <em>Calder</em>, <em>supra</em>), s. 35(1) has constitutionalized it in its full form.</p>
<p>I expressed this understanding of the relationship between common law aboriginal rights, including aboriginal title, and the aboriginal rights protected by s. 35(1) in <em>Vanderpeet</em>. While explaining the purposes behind s. 35(1), I stated that “it must be remembered that s. 35(1) did not create the legal doctrine of aboriginal rights; aboriginal rights existed and were recognized under the common law” (at para. 28). Through the enactment of s. 35(1), “a pre-existing legal doctrine was elevated to constitutional status” (at para. 29), or in other words, s. 35(1) had achieved “the constitutionalization of those rights” (at para. 29).</p>
<p>Finally, this view of the effect of s. 35(1) on common law aboriginal title is supported by numerous commentators: Patrick Macklem, “First Nations Self-Government and the Borders of the Canadian Legal Imagination” (1991), 36 <em>McGill L.J.</em> 382, at pp. 447-48; Kent McNeil, “The Constitutional Rights of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada” (1982), 4 <em>Sup. Ct. L. Rev.</em> 255, at pp. 256-57; James O’Reilly, “La Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 droit des autochtones” (1984) 25 C. De D. 125, at p.137; William Pentney, “The Rights of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada in the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em> Part II - Section 35: The Substantive Guarantee”, <em>supra</em>, at pp. 220-21; Douglas Sanders, “The Rights of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada” (1983), 61 <em>Can. Bar Rev.</em> 314, at p. 329; Douglas Sanders, “Pre-Existing Rights: The Aboriginal Peoples of Canada”, in Gérald-A. Beaudoin &amp; Ed Ratushny, eds., <em>The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em> (2nd ed. 1989), at pp. 731-32; Brian Slattery, “The Constitutional Guarantee of Aboriginal Treaty Rights”, <em>supra</em>, at p. 254; Brian Slattery, <em>Ancestral Lands, Alien Laws: Judicial Perspectives on Aboriginal Title</em>, <em>supra</em>, at p. 45.</p>
<p>I hasten to add that the constitutionalization of common law aboriginal rights by s. 35(1) does not mean that those rights exhaust the content of s. 35(1). As I said in <em>Côté</em>, supra, at para. 52:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[s]ection 35(1) would fail to achieve its noble purpose of preserving the integral and defining features of distinctive aboriginal societies if it only protected those defining features which were fortunate enough to have received the legal recognition and approval of European colonizers.</p></blockquote>
<p>I relied on this proposition in <em>Côté</em> to defeat the argument that the possible absence of aboriginal rights under French colonial law was a bar to the existence of aboriginal rights under s. 35(1) within the historic boundaries of New France. But it also follows that the existence of a particular aboriginal right at common law is not a <em>sine qua non</em> for the proof of an aboriginal right that is recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1). Indeed, none of the decisions of this Court handed down under s. 35(1) in which the existence of an aboriginal right has been demonstrated has relied on the existence of that right at common law. The existence of an aboriginal right at common law is therefore sufficient, but not necessary, for the recognition and affirmation of that right by s. 35(1).</p>
<p>The acknowledgement that s. 35(1) has accorded constitutional status to common law aboriginal title raises a further question — the relationship of aboriginal title to the “aboriginal rights” protected by s. 35(1). I addressed that question in <em>Adams</em>, <em>supra</em>, where the Court had been presented with two radically different conceptions of this relationship. The first conceived of aboriginal rights as being “inherently based in aboriginal title to the land” (at para. 25), or as fragments of a broader claim to aboriginal title. By implication, aboriginal rights must rest either in a claim to title or the unextinguished remnants of title. Taken to its logical extreme, this suggests that aboriginal title is merely the sum of a set of individual aboriginal rights, and that it therefore has no independent content. However, I rejected this position for another — that aboriginal title is “simply one manifestation of a broader-based conception of aboriginal rights” (at para. 25). Thus, although aboriginal title is a species of aboriginal right recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1), it is distinct from other aboriginal rights because it arises where the connection of a group with a piece of land “was of a central significance to their distinctive culture” (at para. 26).</p>
<p>The picture which emerges from <em>Adams</em> is that the aboriginal rights which are recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1) fall along a spectrum with respect to their degree of connection with the land. At the one end, there are those aboriginal rights which are practices, customs and traditions that are integral to the distinctive aboriginal culture of the group claiming the right. However, the “occupation and use of the land” where the activity is taking place is not “sufficient to support a claim of title to the land” (at para. 26). Nevertheless, those activities receive constitutional protection. In the middle, there are activities which, out of necessity, take place on land and indeed, might be intimately related to a particular piece of land. Although an aboriginal group may not be able to demonstrate title to the land, it may nevertheless have a site-specific right to engage in a particular activity. I put the point this way in <em>Adams</em>, at para. 30:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even where an aboriginal right exists on a tract of land to which the aboriginal people in question do not have title, that right may well be site specific, with the result that it can be exercised only upon that specific tract of land. For example, if an aboriginal people demonstrates that hunting on a specific tract of land was an integral part of their distinctive culture then, even if the right exists apart from title to that tract of land, the aboriginal right to hunt is nonetheless defined as, and limited to, the right to hunt on the specific tract of land. [Emphasis added.]</p></blockquote>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, there is aboriginal title itself. As <em>Adams</em> makes clear, aboriginal title confers more than the right to engage in site-specific activities which are aspects of the practices, customs and traditions of distinctive aboriginal cultures. Site-specific rights can be made out even if title cannot. What aboriginal title confers is the right to the land itself.</p>
<p>Because aboriginal rights can vary with respect to their degree of connection with the land, some aboriginal groups may be unable to make out a claim to title, but will nevertheless possess aboriginal rights that are recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1), including site-specific rights to engage in particular activities. As I explained in <em>Adams</em>, this may occur in the case of nomadic peoples who varied “the location of their settlements with the season and changing circumstances” (at para. 27). The fact that aboriginal peoples were non-sedentary, however (at para. 27):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>does not alter the fact that nomadic peoples survived through reliance on the land prior to contact with Europeans and, further, that many of the practices, customs and traditions of nomadic peoples that took place on the land were integral to their distinctive cultures.</p></blockquote>

<p>In addition to differing in the degree of connection with the land, aboriginal title differs from other aboriginal rights in another way. To date, the Court has defined aboriginal rights in terms of <em>activities</em>. As I said in <em>Vanderpeet</em> (at para. 46):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in order to be an aboriginal right an activity must be an element of a practice, custom or tradition integral to the distinctive culture of the aboriginal group claiming the right. [Emphasis added.]</p></blockquote>
<p>Aboriginal title, however, is a <em>right to the land</em> itself. Subject to the limits I have laid down above, that land may be used for a variety of activities, none of which need be individually protected as aboriginal rights under s. 35(1). Those activities are parasitic on the underlying title.</p>
<p>This difference between aboriginal rights to engage in particular activities and aboriginal title requires that the test I laid down in <em>Vanderpeet</em> be adapted accordingly. I anticipated this possibility in <em>Vanderpeet</em> itself, where I stated that (at para. 74):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aboriginal rights arise from the prior occupation of land, but they also arise from the prior social organization and distinctive cultures of aboriginal peoples on that land. In considering whether a claim to an aboriginal right has been made out, courts must look at both the relationship of an aboriginal claimant to the land and [emphasis in original] at the practices, customs and traditions arising from the claimant’s distinctive culture and society. Courts must not focus so entirely on the relationship of aboriginal peoples with the land that they lose sight of the other factors relevant to the identification and definition of aboriginal rights. [Emphasis added.]</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the purpose of s. 35(1) is to reconcile the prior presence of aboriginal peoples in North America with the assertion of Crown sovereignty, it is clear from this statement that s. 35(1) must recognize and affirm both aspects of that prior presence — first, the occupation of land, and second, the prior social organization and distinctive cultures of aboriginal peoples on that land. To date the jurisprudence under s. 35(1) has given more emphasis to the second aspect. To a great extent, this has been a function of the types of cases which have come before this Court under s. 35(1) — prosecutions for regulatory offences that, by their very nature, proscribe discrete types of activity.</p>
<p>The adaptation of the test laid down in <em>Vanderpeet</em> to suit claims to title must be understood as the recognition of the first aspect of that prior presence. However, as will now become apparent, the tests for the identification of aboriginal rights to engage in particular activities and for the identification of aboriginal title share broad similarities. The major distinctions are first, under the test for aboriginal title, the requirement that the land be integral to the distinctive culture of the claimants is subsumed by the requirement of occupancy, and second, whereas the time for the identification of aboriginal rights is the time of first contact, the time for the identification of aboriginal title is the time at which the Crown asserted sovereignty over the land.</p>
<h6 id="ii-the-test-for-the-proof-of-aboriginal-title">
  (ii) The test for the proof of Aboriginal title
  <a class="anchor" href="#ii-the-test-for-the-proof-of-aboriginal-title">#</a>
</h6>
<p>In order to make out a claim for aboriginal title, the aboriginal group asserting title must satisfy the following criteria: (i) the land must have been occupied prior to sovereignty, (ii) if present occupation is relied on as proof of occupation pre-sovereignty, there must be a continuity between present and pre-sovereignty occupation, and (iii) at sovereignty, that occupation must have been exclusive.</p>
<p><strong>The land must have been occupied prior to sovereignty.</strong></p>
<p>In order to establish a claim to aboriginal title, the aboriginal group asserting the claim must establish that it occupied the lands in question at the <em>time at which the Crown asserted sovereignty over the land subject to the title</em>. The relevant time period for the establishment of title is, therefore, different than for the establishment of aboriginal rights to engage in specific activities. In <em>Vanderpeet</em>, I held, at para. 60 that “[t]he time period that a court should consider in identifying whether the right claimed meets the standard of being integral to the aboriginal community claiming the right is the period prior to contact….”. This arises from the fact that in defining the central and distinctive attributes of pre-existing aboriginal societies it is necessary to look to a time prior to the arrival of Europeans. Practices, customs or traditions that arose solely as a response to European influences do not meet the standard for recognition as aboriginal rights.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the context of aboriginal title, sovereignty is the appropriate time period to consider for several reasons. First, from a theoretical standpoint, aboriginal title arises out of prior occupation of the land by aboriginal peoples and out of the relationship between the common law and pre-existing systems of aboriginal law. Aboriginal title is a burden on the Crown’s underlying title. However, the Crown did not gain this title until it asserted sovereignty over the land in question. Because it does not make sense to speak of a burden on the underlying title before that title existed, aboriginal title crystallized at the time sovereignty was asserted. Second, aboriginal title does not raise the problem of distinguishing between distinctive, integral aboriginal practices, customs and traditions and those influenced or introduced by European contact. Under common law, the act of occupation or possession is sufficient to ground aboriginal title and it is not necessary to prove that the land was a distinctive or integral part of the aboriginal society before the arrival of Europeans. Finally, from a practical standpoint, it appears that the date of sovereignty is more certain than the date of first contact. It is often very difficult to determine the precise moment that each aboriginal group had first contact with European culture. I note that this is the approach has support in the academic literature: Brian Slattery, “Understanding Aboriginal Rights”, <em>supra</em>, at p. 742; Kent McNeil, <em>Common Law Aboriginal Title</em>, <em>supra</em>, at p. 196. For these reasons, I conclude that aboriginals must establish occupation of the land from the date of the assertion of sovereignty in order to sustain a claim for aboriginal title. McEachern C.J. found, at pp. 233-34, and the parties did not dispute on appeal, that British sovereignty over British Columbia was conclusively established by the Oregon Boundary Treaty of 1846. This is not to say that circumstances subsequent to sovereignty may never be relevant to title or compensation; this might be the case, for example, where native bands have been dispossessed of traditional lands after sovereignty.</p>
<p>There was a consensus among the parties on appeal that proof of historic occupation was required to make out a claim to aboriginal title. However, the parties disagreed on how that occupancy could be proved. The respondents assert that in order to establish aboriginal title, the occupation must be the physical occupation of the land in question. The appellant Gitksan nation argue, by contrast, that aboriginal title may be established, at least in part, by reference to aboriginal law.</p>
<p>This debate over the proof of occupancy reflects two divergent views of the source of aboriginal title. The respondents argue, in essence, that aboriginal title arises from the physical reality at the time of sovereignty, whereas the Gitksan effectively take the position that aboriginal title arises from and should reflect the pattern of land holdings under aboriginal law. However, as I have explained above, the source of aboriginal title appears to be grounded both in the common law and in the aboriginal perspective on land; the latter includes, but is not limited to, their systems of law. It follows that both should be taken into account in establishing the proof of occupancy. Indeed, there is precedent for doing so. In <em>Baker Lake (Hamlet)</em>, <em>supra</em>, Mahoney J. held that to prove aboriginal title, the claimants needed both to demonstrate their “physical presence on the land they occupied” (at p. 561) and the existence “among [that group of] &hellip; a recognition of the claimed rights&hellip; by the regime that prevailed before” (at p. 559).</p>
<p>This approach to the proof of occupancy at common law is also mandated in the context of s. 35(1) by <em>Vanderpeet</em>. In that decision, as I stated above, I held at para. 50 that the reconciliation of the prior occupation of North America by aboriginal peoples with the assertion of Crown sovereignty required that account be taken of the “aboriginal perspective while at the same time taking into account the perspective of the common law” and that “[t]rue reconciliation will, equally, place weight on each”. I also held that the aboriginal perspective on the occupation of their lands can be gleaned, in part, but not exclusively, from their traditional laws, because those laws were elements of the practices, customs and traditions of aboriginal peoples: at para. 41. As a result, if, at the time of sovereignty, an aboriginal society had laws in relation to land, those laws would be relevant to establishing the occupation of lands which are the subject of a claim for aboriginal title. Relevant laws might include, but are not limited to, a land tenure system or laws governing land use.</p>
<p>However, the aboriginal perspective must be taken into account alongside the perspective of the common law. Professor McNeil has convincingly argued that at common law, the fact of physical occupation is proof of possession at law, which in turn will ground title to the land: <em>Common Law Aboriginal Title</em>, <em>supra</em>, at p. 73; also see Cheshire and Burn, <em>Modern Law of Real Property</em>, <em>supra</em>, at p. 28; and Megarry and Wade, <em>The Law of Real Property</em>, <em>supra</em>, at p. 1006. Physical occupation may be established in a variety of ways, ranging from the construction of dwellings through cultivation and enclosure of fields to regular use of definite tracts of land for hunting, fishing or otherwise exploiting its resources: see McNeil, <em>Common Law Aboriginal Title</em>, <em>supra</em> at pp. 201-202. In considering whether occupation sufficient to ground title is established, “one must take into account the group’s size, manner of life, material resources, and technological abilities, and the character of the lands claimed”: Brian Slattery, “Understanding Aboriginal Rights”, at pp. 758.</p>
<p>In <em>Vanderpeet</em>, I drew a distinction between those practices, customs and traditions of aboriginal peoples which were “an aspect of, or took place in” the society of the aboriginal group asserting the claim and those which were “a central and significant part of the society’s culture” (at para. 55). The latter stood apart because they “made the culture of that society distinctive &hellip; it was one of the things which truly made the society what it was” (at para. 55). The same requirement operates in the determination of the proof of aboriginal title. As I said in <em>Adams</em>, a claim to title is made out when a group can demonstrate “that their connection with the piece of land &hellip; was of central significance to their distinctive culture” (at para. 26).</p>
<p>Although this remains a crucial part of the test for aboriginal rights, given the occupancy requirement in the test for aboriginal title, I cannot imagine a situation where this requirement would actually serve to limit or preclude a title claim. The requirement exists for rights short of title because it is necessary to distinguish between those practices which were central to the culture of claimants and those which were more incidental. However, in the case of title, it would seem clear that any land that was occupied pre-sovereignty, and which the parties have maintained a substantial connection with since then, is sufficiently important to be of central significance to the culture of the claimants. As a result, I do not think it is necessary to include explicitly this element as part of the test for aboriginal title. …</p>
<p>[<em>Chief Justice Lamer went on to analyze the second and third prongs of the test for proof of Aboriginal title: (ii) if present occupation is relied on as proof of occupation pre-sovereignty, there must be a continuity between present and pre-sovereignty occupation, and (iii) at sovereignty, that occupation must have been exclusive. The Chief Justice also discussed the possibility of Crown infringement of Aboriginal title once that has been successfully proven. These elements are described in more detail in Tsilhqot&rsquo;in Nation v British Columbia, below</em>]</p>
<h3 id="vi-conclusion-and-disposition">
  VI. Conclusion and Disposition
  <a class="anchor" href="#vi-conclusion-and-disposition">#</a>
</h3>
<p>For the reasons I have given above, I would allow the appeal in part, and dismiss the cross-appeal. Reluctantly, I would also order a new trial.</p>
<p>I conclude with two observations. The first is that many aboriginal nations with territorial claims that overlap with those of the appellants did not intervene in this appeal, and do not appear to have done so at trial. This is unfortunate, because determinations of aboriginal title for the Gitksan and Wet’suwet’en will undoubtedly affect their claims as well. This is particularly so because aboriginal title encompasses an <em>exclusive</em> right to the use and occupation of land, i.e., to the <em>exclusion</em> of both non-aboriginals and members of other aboriginal nations. It may, therefore, be advisable if those aboriginal nations intervened in any new litigation.</p>
<p>Finally, this litigation has been both long and expensive, not only in economic but in human terms as well. By ordering a new trial, I do not necessarily encourage the parties to proceed to litigation and to settle their dispute through the courts. As was said in <em>Sparrow</em>, at p. 1105, s. 35(1) “provides a solid constitutional base upon which subsequent negotiations can take place”. Those negotiations should also include other aboriginal nations which have a stake in the territory claimed. Moreover, the Crown is under a moral, if not a legal, duty to enter into and conduct those negotiations in good faith. Ultimately, it is through negotiated settlements, with good faith and give and take on all sides, reinforced by the judgments of this Court, that we will achieve what I stated in <em>Vanderpeet</em>, <em>supra</em>, at para. 31, to be a basic purpose of s. 35(1) — “the reconciliation of the pre-existence of aboriginal societies with the sovereignty of the Crown”. Let us face it, we are all here to stay.</p>
