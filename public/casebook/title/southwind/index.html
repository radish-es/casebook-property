At the beginning of the twentieth century, Canada needed more
electricity to fuel Winnipeg&rsquo;s economic growth. The governments of
Canada, Manitoba, and Ontario decided to create a water reservoir in
northern Ontario to power hydroelectricity generation. They settled on
Lac Seul, which flows into both Ontario and Manitoba, and determined
that if they raised the water level of Lac Seul by 10 feet, or
approximately 3 metres, they could generate substantial electricity.
Construction of the dam was completed in 1929 and the water steadily
rose through the 1930s. The project was a success for the three
governments.">

</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the twentieth century, Canada needed more
electricity to fuel Winnipeg&rsquo;s economic growth. The governments of
Canada, Manitoba, and Ontario decided to create a water reservoir in
northern Ontario to power hydroelectricity generation. They settled on
Lac Seul, which flows into both Ontario and Manitoba, and determined
that if they raised the water level of Lac Seul by 10 feet, or
approximately 3 metres, they could generate substantial electricity.
Construction of the dam was completed in 1929 and the water steadily
rose through the 1930s. The project was a success for the three
governments.</p>
<p>The project was also a tragedy for the Lac Seul First Nation
(LSFN). The LSFN&rsquo;s reserve (Reserve) is located on the southeastern
shore of Lac Seul. Almost one-fifth of its best land was flooded and its
members were &ldquo;deprived of their livelihood, robbed of their natural
resources, and driven out of their home[s]&rdquo; (2017 FC 906, [2018] 4 C.N.L.R. 63).</p>
<p>Canada was aware from the outset that flooding Lac Seul by 10
feet would cause &ldquo;very considerable&rdquo; damage to the Reserve. In the late
1920s, the Supervisor responsible for valuing the loss warned that the
Reserve would be &ldquo;ruined for any purpose [for] which it was set
aside&rdquo;, that the members of the First Nation were &ldquo;helpless to avert
this calamity&rdquo;, and that they viewed their future &ldquo;with utter dismay&rdquo;
(Trial Reasons, at paras. 152 and 156).</p>
<p>Despite repeated warnings from government officials about the
impact that the project would have on the First Nation, the project
advanced without the consent of the Lac Seul First Nation, without any
compensation, and without the lawful authorization required.</p>
<p>Since the <em>Royal Proclamation, 1763</em> (G.B.), 3 Geo. 3 (reproduced
in R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 1), Indigenous interests in land, including
reserve land, cannot be taken or used without legal authorization from
the Crown. The <em>Indian Act</em>, R.S.C. 1927, c. 98, permitted expropriation for public works, but only with
the approval of Cabinet through the Governor in Council. Treaty No. 3
(1873), that set aside the reserve land for the LSFN, required &ldquo;due
compensation&rdquo; for any taking or appropriation. In addition, this Court
recognized in <em>Guerin v. The Queen</em>, and subsequent decisions, that the
Crown is subject to a fiduciary duty when it exercises control over
Indigenous interests. This fiduciary duty imposes strict obligations on
the Crown to advance the best interests of Indigenous Peoples.</p>
<p>The trial judge concluded that Canada failed to meet its
fiduciary duty to the Lac Seul First Nation in respect of its interest
in Reserve land. On appeal, Canada does not dispute this conclusion.</p>
<p>Canada did not keep the LSFN informed about the project; did not
consult the LSFN; did not negotiate on the LSFN&rsquo;s behalf to get the best
compensation possible; did not use its power to refuse to authorize the
project until the other parties agreed to fair compensation; and the
compensation Canada did manage to negotiate &mdash; 14 years after the
flooding began &mdash; was inadequate. This was unlawful and egregious
conduct, even by the standards of the time. As the trial judge observed,
this outcome was &ldquo;inexplicable&rdquo; (para. 298).</p>
<p>The results of Canada&rsquo;s failures are tragic and well documented.
Roughly 17 percent of the Reserve &mdash; 11,304 acres or approximately
4,575 hectares &mdash; is now permanently flooded. Homes were destroyed, as
were wild rice fields, gardens, haylands, and gravesites. Fishing,
hunting, and trapping were all impacted. The LSFN was separated because
one part of the Reserve became an island. And, despite the sacrifices
suffered by the LSFN to make the hydroelectricity project possible, the
Reserve was not provided with electricity until the 1980s.</p>
<p>The LSFN challenges the trial judge&rsquo;s evaluation of equitable
compensation for the loss of the flooded lands. The issue for this Court
is how to assess equitable compensation for the loss caused by Canada&rsquo;s
breach of fiduciary duty. The central inquiry is: what position would
the beneficiary be in had the fiduciary fulfilled its obligations?</p>
<p>The trial judge valued the flooded land based on its value in
1929, with 10 percent valued as waterfront land and 90 percent valued as
bushland. He determined that because Canada was authorized to
expropriate the land for a public work under the provisions in force at
the time, the land should be valued based upon an expropriation in 1929.
Thus, the trial judge concluded that the First Nation was not entitled
to be compensated for any value that the land provided to the
hydroelectricity project itself.</p>
<p>In my view, this approach to equitable compensation for breach
of fiduciary duty is flawed. By looking solely at the amount the LSFN
would have received if Canada had complied with the general law relating
to expropriation, the trial judge gave no effect to the unique
obligations imposed by the fiduciary duty. The trial judge improperly
focused on what Canada would <em>likely have done</em>, as opposed to what
Canada <em>ought to have done</em> as a fiduciary. While I agree with much of
the trial judge&rsquo;s analysis, this error tainted his assessment of
equitable compensation.</p>
<p>The fiduciary duty imposes heavy obligations on Canada. The duty
does not melt away when Canada has competing priorities. Canada was
under an obligation to preserve and protect the LSFN&rsquo;s interest in the
Reserve. This included an obligation to negotiate compensation for the
LSFN on the basis of the value of the land to the hydroelectricity
project. Compensation must be assessed on that basis.</p>
<p>I would allow the appeal and remit the case back to the Federal
Court for reassessment of the equitable compensation to include the
value of the flooded land to the hydroelectricity project.</p>

  I. Background
  <a class="anchor" href="#i-background">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The LSFN is a Treaty 3 First Nation in Northern Ontario. The
members are Anishinaabe people. According to Chief Clifford Bull, they
have always been lake dwellers who travelled through the water, kept
their homes and gardens near the water, cultivated wild rice in the
water, fished in the water, and hunted near the water.</p>
<p>The LSFN&rsquo;s traditional territory extends from the Trout Lake
region in northwestern Ontario, southeast through the Lac Seul region,
and northeast towards Lake St. Joseph. The LSFN has one Reserve, called
the Lac Seul Indian Reserve No. 28, which is located on the southeastern
shore of Lac Seul in northern Ontario. The Reserve has three communities
&ndash; Kejick Bay, Whitefish Bay, and Frenchman&rsquo;s Head.</p>
<p>The Reserve was created under Treaty 3, which required Canada to
select and set aside reserves that would be &ldquo;most convenient and
advantageous for each band or bands of Indians&rdquo;. In 1875, the LSFN chose
Lac Seul as the site of the Reserve because of the resources along the
shoreline and the social, cultural, and spiritual importance of the
area.</p>
<p>In the early twentieth century, Canada wanted to provide more
electricity to Winnipeg. By 1911, Canada identified Lac Seul as a
potential reservoir for hydroelectricity generation (Project). Lac Seul
flows into the English River in Ontario, which in turn flows into the
Winnipeg River in Manitoba. In 1915, the Dominion Water Power Branch,
within the Department of the Interior, prepared a report noting that a
10 foot flooding of Lac Seul would increase the power potential on the
English River by 233 percent.</p>
<p>In the same year, the Manitoba Hydrographic Survey began
preliminary fieldwork. Chief John Akewance of the LSFN first became
aware of the potential Project through the fieldwork, and wrote to
Indian Agent R. S. McKenzie in 1915 outlining his concerns. Canada
advised the Indian Agent that &ldquo;there is no present intention to raise
the waters of Lac Seul&rdquo; (Trial Reasons, at para. 127).</p>
<p>The fieldwork report was released in 1916 and noted that the
Project would flood portions of the Reserve. In 1917, Canada recommended
to Ontario that it obtain flowage rights over the land that would need
to be flooded. In 1919, Canada informed itself about the procedure for
granting flowage rights on reserve land:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If after negotiation the offer is accepted on behalf of the Indians, or
amended and so accepted, the amount of compensation agreed upon is
deposited with the Minister of Finance for the use of the band of
Indians and the land is surrendered. (Trial Reasons, at para. 132)</p></blockquote>
<p>Canada wrote to Ontario again in 1921 urging that they reserve the
flooding rights. There is no record of a response.</p>
<p>In 1924, Chief Paul Thomas met with Indian Agent Frank Edwards
to express the LSFN&rsquo;s concerns. Agent Edwards told Chief Thomas that
Canada would &ldquo;<em>protect their interests as far as possible</em>&rdquo; (Trial
Reasons, at para. 137 (emphasis in original)).</p>
<p>In February 1928, Canada, Ontario, and Manitoba entered into the
Lac Seul Storage Agreement which governed the construction and ownership
of the Project. The agreement apportioned the capital costs among the
governments, which included &ldquo;the cost of acquiring flooding privileges
or other necessary easements&rdquo; and &ldquo;compensation for timber, buildings
and improvements, including Ontario Crown Lands, Indian Lands and lands
owned by private individuals&rdquo; (Trial Reasons, at para. 147).</p>
<p>In April 1928, Ontario wrote to affected landowners regarding
the Project. Ontario also notified the Department of Indian Affairs and
indicated that the water levels would be raised by approximately 12
feet. In the summer of 1928, H. J. Bury, the Supervisor of Indian Timber
Lands, appraised the value of the LSFN&rsquo;s anticipated losses at
$120,200. Ontario disagreed with the estimate. Mr. Bury reiterated his
position in two internal memoranda. On May 14, 1929, he wrote that
&ldquo;[t]he reserve is ruined for any purpose [for] which it was set
aside ... for the Indians&rdquo; (Trial Reasons, at para. 156). Two days
later, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are 688 Indians on the reserve, who are helpless to avert this
calamity, and who view the future with utter dismay, but I feel that the
associated governments concerned, will not permit these Indians to be
deprived of their livelihood, robbed of their natural resources, and
driven out of their home[s], without not only allowing them generous
monetary compensation, but also make provision, during the period of
years in which they will have to re-adjust themselves to new and strange
conditions, for exclusive trapping rights for them in a district remote
from civilization. (Trial Reasons, para. 156)</p></blockquote>
<p>On May 17, 1929, the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian
Affairs wrote to his superior that &ldquo;[t]he situation is certainly
serious; and hardship and disaster appear to face these poor Indians
unless some arrangement is made at once, providing for reasonable
compensation and the allocation of suitable hunting and fishing grounds
elsewhere&rdquo; (Trial Reasons, at para. 157). No agreement regarding
compensation to the LSFN was reached with Ontario.</p>
<p>Ontario applied for necessary approvals in July 1928. The
application noted that &ldquo;[i]t will be necessary in connection with the
proposed work to acquire flowage rights over lands on an Indian Reserve&rdquo;
(Trial Reasons, at para. 159 (emphasis deleted)). Even though those
rights were never acquired, the dam was completed by June 1929. The
power site, the Ear Falls Generating Station, was completed and began
delivering power in February 1930.</p>
<p>The flooding of Lac Seul was delayed by disagreements between
Canada and Ontario regarding timber clearing. Ontario wanted to harvest
its Crown timber prior to flooding. To resolve the impasse, Canada
proposed that the timber clearing could be accomplished as an
unemployment project under Canada&rsquo;s depression-era . As negotiations for
this relief project unfolded, Canada assured the LSFN&rsquo;s members that
&ldquo;<em>their interests will be protected to the fullest possible extent</em>&rdquo;
(Trial Reasons, at para. 181 (emphasis in original)).</p>
<p>In July 1933, Canada&rsquo;s Minister of the Interior signed the
agreement for the relief project. A week later, the local Indian Agent
and the timber supervisor assured the LSFN that the water would not be
raised &ldquo;for several years to come&rdquo; (Trial Reasons, at para. 183). The
relief project was a failure. Less than 700 acres were cleared at a cost
of over $850,000 to Canada. Members of the LSFN were excluded from
employment in the project.</p>
<p>Despite the assurances given to the LSFN, the waters of Lac Seul
began to rise in 1934. The damage was extensive. Agent Edwards estimated
that at least 29 houses would need to be rebuilt &mdash; in total,
one-quarter to one-third of the houses ultimately had to be moved or
replaced. Between 1935 and 1939, additional damage was documented. In
August 1936, Canada&rsquo;s Superintendent General of Indian Affairs wrote to
Ontario&rsquo;s Minister of Lands and Forests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... the Lac Seul Indian Reserve has been flooded to such a serious
extent that we have been compelled already to construct many new houses
for the Indians at a cost of $25,000 and the flood conditions have not
only submerged the Indian hay lands, gardens and cultivated land, but
have also seriously impaired the efforts of these Indians to earn their
livelihood.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>... The Indians of this Reserve have been definitely assured that their
interests would be fully protected and they are at present much
disturbed and alarmed at the damage already caused. [Emphasis
deleted.] (Trial Reasons, at para. 192)</p></blockquote>
<p>In March 1937, Mr. Bury wrote a memorandum regarding the ongoing
failure to provide compensation. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I desire to again draw your attention to the serious breach of faith
that our Department has made with the Indians of the Lac Seul Reserve,
respecting promises made to them regarding flooding compensation ...</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;]</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I consider that these Indians have been very shabbily treated. Their
Reserve lands, timber, houses, gardens, rice beds, musk-rat swamps have
been flooded now for some years, and we still procrastinate[.] [I]f
it had been a white settlement, no person would have dared to flood the
property, without paying compensation before flooding took place.
[Emphasis deleted.] (Trial Reasons, at para. 194)</p></blockquote>
<p>Negotiations between Canada and Ontario continued. In 1940,
Ontario determined that $50,000 would be a &ldquo;fair valuation&rdquo; of
compensation, but Ontario also claimed it was owed compensation for what
it viewed as excess acres on the Reserve as well as outstanding claims
for timber clearing. The LSFN was not consulted nor informed of the
impending settlement.</p>
<p>In 1943, Canada and Ontario finally agreed to a claim amount of
$72,539, with deductions of $5,000 to pay a timber claim submitted by
a lumber company and $17,276 to pay Ontario for &ldquo;excess acres&rdquo; on the
Reserve. The balance, $50,263, was deposited into the LSFN&rsquo;s trust
account on November 17, 1943.</p>
<p>By contrast, Ontario and Canada negotiated compensation with
other non-Indigenous groups whose property fell within the flood plain
of the dam project, such as the Anglican Church Missionary Society, the
Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company, and the Canadian National Railway. For instance,
the Anglican Church Missionary Society received compensation for the
timber destroyed in the floods and for the costs of relocating its
church and cemetery. Similarly, the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company engaged in
protracted negotiations with the federal government that resulted in
compensation not only for &ldquo;Flowage Rights&rdquo; over the company&rsquo;s territory,
but also for the value of the buildings and other facilities.</p>
<p>Canada&rsquo;s conduct towards the LSFN also differs from its conduct
in three earlier projects that impacted another First Nation. In the
early 1910s, Calgary Power and Transmission sought permission from
Indian Affairs to flood reserve lands of the Stoney Indian Band in
Alberta for three hydroelectricity projects (Kananaskis Falls Projects).
For all three projects, Canada negotiated a surrender on behalf of the
First Nation and insisted on compensation reflecting the value of the
land to hydroelectricity generation. Calgary Power entered into three
agreements which provided two forms of compensation: a one-time payment
for flooded land and a yearly water power rental agreement. This
compensation was based upon the value of the land to the project.</p>
<p>Here, there was never a negotiated surrender of the land by the
LSFN and Canada did not at any point expropriate the land in accordance
with the provisions of the <em>Indian Act</em>. Nonetheless, the Project was completed in
1929 and the lands were steadily flooded throughout the 1930s. A total
of 11,304 acres, approximately 17 percent of the Reserve, is now
flooded. The flooding destroyed wild rice fields, gardens, and haylands
for livestock. It impacted fishing and damaged homes, campsites, and
shoreline infrastructure. The flooding damaged and exposed graves that
were not relocated prior to the flooding. One of the LSFN&rsquo;s communities,
Kejick Bay, became an island separated from the other communities.</p>
<p>In September 1985, the LSFN submitted a claim for flooding
damages to the Specific Claims Branch of the Department of Indian and
Northern Affairs Canada. In 1991, Roger Southwind, for himself and on
behalf of the members of the Lac Seul Band of Indians, filed a civil
claim against Canada. In November 2006, 63 years after the settlement,
the LSFN entered into an agreement with Ontario Power Generation (OPG),
the current operator of the Ear Falls Generating Station. The agreement
included $11,200,000 in compensation for losses arising from the Ear
Falls Generating Station on the LSFN&rsquo;s traditional territory, but
expressly excluded damages caused by the flooding in the 1930s. The
settlement included a plan to open a new generating station and provided
the LSFN with the opportunity to purchase an equity position of 25
percent. In February 2009, OPG opened the new generating station in
partnership with the First Nation. In 2009, a causeway was built to
finally reconnect Kejick Bay Island and the Reserve mainland. The LSFN
contributed $1,750,000 to this and a related project.</p>

  <strong>A. Canada&rsquo;s Fiduciary Duty to Indigenous Peoples</strong>
  <a class="anchor" href="#a-canada">#</a>
</h4>
<p>The existence of a fiduciary duty is not in dispute in this
appeal. Canada does not contest the trial judge&rsquo;s determination that
Canada owed a fiduciary duty to the LSFN and breached that duty.
However, the specific nature of the Crown&rsquo;s fiduciary duty to Indigenous
Peoples, especially over reserve land, informs how equitable
compensation must be assessed.</p>
<p>The Crown&rsquo;s fiduciary duty is rooted in the obligation of
honourable dealing and in the overarching goal of reconciliation between
the Crown and the first inhabitants of Canada (<em>Haida Nation v. British
Columbia (Minister of Forests)</em> 2004 SCC 73, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 511, at
paras. 17-18). Professor Slattery describes the honour of the Crown as a
&ldquo;grounding postulate of Canadian constitutional law&rdquo; (B. Slattery, &ldquo;The
Aboriginal Constitution&rdquo; (2014), 67 <em>S.C.L.R</em>. (2d) 319, at p. 320).
McLachlin C.J. explained in <em>Haida Nation</em> that the &ldquo;process of
reconciliation flows from the Crown&rsquo;s duty of honourable dealing toward
Aboriginal peoples, which arises in turn from the Crown&rsquo;s assertion of
sovereignty over an Aboriginal people and <em>de facto</em> control of land and
resources that were formerly in the control of that people&rdquo; (para. 32;
see also <em>R. v. Desautel</em>, 2021 SCC 17, [2021] X S.C.R. XXX, at para.
22). This is an ongoing project that seeks the &ldquo;reconciliation of
Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians in a mutually respectful
long-term relationship&rdquo; (<em>Beckman v. Little Salmon/Carmacks First
Nation</em>2010 SCC 53, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 103, at para. 10).</p>
<p>This Court first acknowledged a fiduciary duty in <em>Guerin</em>. In
<em>Guerin</em>, Canada argued that it could not be subject to a fiduciary duty
and, at best, the Crown&rsquo;s control over Indigenous interests in land is a
political trust which is unenforceable by the courts (p. 371). Dickson
J., writing for a majority, rejected Canada&rsquo;s argument. Instead, he
found that Indigenous interests in land are &ldquo;a pre-existing legal right
not created by Royal Proclamation, by s. 18(1) of the <em>Indian Act</em>, or
by any other executive order or legislative provision&rdquo; (p. 379; see also
J. T. S. McCabe, <em>The Honour of the Crown and its Fiduciary Duties to
Aboriginal Peoples</em> (2008), at pp. 150-51). In other words, the
Indigenous interest in land <em>did not flow from the Crown</em>; it
pre-existed the Crown&rsquo;s assertion of sovereignty.</p>
<p>Through the <em>Royal Proclamation, 1763</em>, the Crown undertook
discretionary control over these pre-existing Indigenous interests in
land. The <em>Proclamation</em> provided: &ldquo;And We do hereby strictly forbid, on
Pain of our Displeasure, all our loving Subjects from making any
Purchases or Settlements whatever, or taking Possession of any of the
Lands above reserved, <em>without our especial leave and Licence for that
Purpose first obtained</em>.&rdquo; The <em>Indian Act</em> and its predecessor statutes
formalized the process for setting aside reserve land and the Crown&rsquo;s
legal control over that land. The Crown thus undertook the &ldquo;historic
responsibility ... to act on behalf of the Indians so as to protect
their interests in transactions with third parties&rdquo; (<em>Guerin</em>, at p.
383). In <em>Guerin</em>, this Court recognized that a fiduciary duty arose
because the Crown interposed itself between Indigenous lands and those
who want to lease or purchase the land, thereby exercising discretionary
control over the land (pp. 383-84). The Crown has a duty that is &ldquo;in the
nature of a private law duty&rdquo; (p. 385).</p>
<p>In <em>Osoyoos Indian Band v. Oliver (Town)</em>, 2001 SCC 85, [2001]
3 S.C.R. 746, Gonthier J., dissenting, but not on that point, clarified
that the same fiduciary duty applies even where the reserve is not
situated on traditional territory in which the First Nation may have a
pre-existing legal interest. He noted: &ldquo;... an interest in reserve
lands to which no aboriginal title attaches and an interest in
non-reserve lands to which aboriginal title does attach are the same
with respect to the generation of a fiduciary obligation on the part of
the Crown&rdquo; (para. 163).</p>
<p><em>Guerin</em> set to rest the idea that the trust-like language of
historic treaties, laws, and proclamations constituted a mere &ldquo;political
trust&rdquo; unenforceable in courts. Instead, an enforceable <em>sui generis</em>
fiduciary duty arose where the Crown asserted discretionary power over
Indigenous Peoples&rsquo; specific Aboriginal interests and assumed
responsibility for those interests (<em>R. v. Sparrow</em>, [1990] 1 S.C.R.
1075, at p. 1108). This relationship is not paternalistic in nature; it
emerged in a context where the military capacities of Indigenous Peoples
were strong and the Crown needed to mitigate the risk of conflict
between Indigenous Peoples and settlers (<em>Manitoba Metis Federation Inc.
v. Canada (Attorney General)</em> 2013 SCC 14, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 623, at
para. 66; Slattery, at pp. 322 and 326).</p>
<p>Rooted in the honour of the Crown, the Crown&rsquo;s fiduciary duty
exists to further a socially important relationship. It structures the
role voluntarily undertaken by the Crown as the intermediary between
Indigenous interests in land and the interest of settlers. Professor
Rotman, in the context of fiduciary relationships generally, puts it
this way: &ldquo;... while it may appear that the fiduciary concept exists to
protect beneficiaries&rsquo; interests, that effect is merely ancillary to its
protection of fiduciary relationships&rdquo; (L. I. Rotman, &ldquo;Understanding
Fiduciary Duties and Relationship Fiduciarity&rdquo; (2017), 62 <em>McGill L.J</em>.
975, at pp. 987-88). In the context of our national history, the
relationship between the Crown and Indigenous Peoples goes to the very
foundation of this country and to the heart of its identity. Indeed, the
need to reconcile the assertion of Crown sovereignty with the
pre-existence of Indigenous Peoples, and to reconcile Indigenous and
non-Indigenous Canadians is of &ldquo;fundamental importance&rdquo; (<em>R. v. Van der
Peet</em>[1996] 2 S.C.R. 507, at para. 310, per McLachlin J., dissenting,
but not on this point). The honour of the Crown &ndash; and the <em>sui
generis</em> fiduciary duty to which it gives rise &ndash; is a vital component
of the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous Peoples.</p>
<p>However, not all aspects of this relationship are fiduciary in
nature (<em>Haida Nation</em>, at para. 18; <em>Wewaykum Indian Band v.
Canada</em>2002 SCC 79, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 245, at paras. 81 and 83). The
fiduciary duty does not attach to every interest of Indigenous Peoples.
As Binnie J. stated in <em>Wewaykum</em>, &ldquo;[t]he fiduciary duty imposed on
the Crown does not exist at large but in relation to specific Indian
interests&rdquo; (para. 81). The fiduciary duty imposes heavy obligations when
it does arise. The fiduciary duty may arise when the Crown exercises
discretionary control over cognizable Indigenous interests or where the
conditions of a private law <em>ad hoc</em> fiduciary relationship are met
(<em>Williams Lake Indian Band v. Canada (Aboriginal Affairs and Northern
Development)</em> 2018 SCC 4, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 83, at para. 44; <em>Manitoba
Metis</em>, at paras. 48-50; <em>Wewaykum</em>, at para. 85).</p>
<p>The fiduciary duty itself is shaped by the context to which it
applies, which means that its content varies with the nature and the
importance of the right being protected (<em>Williams Lake</em>, at para. 55;
<em>Wewaykum</em>, at para. 86; <em>Manitoba Metis</em>, at para. 49). The Crown&rsquo;s
control over Indigenous interests in land is at the core of the
relationship between the Crown and Indigenous Peoples. Consequently, a
strong fiduciary duty arises where the Crown is exercising control over
a First Nation&rsquo;s land. The same is true where the Crown is exercising
control over Aboriginal and treaty rights that are protected under s. 35
of the <em>Constitution Act</em>, <em>1982</em> (<em>Ermineskin Indian Band and Nation v.
Canada</em> 2009 SCC 9, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 222, at para. 46).</p>
<p>In a case involving reserve land, the <em>sui generis</em> nature of
the interest in reserve land informs the fiduciary duty. Reserve land is
not a fungible commodity. Instead, reserve land reflects the essential
relationship between Indigenous Peoples and the land. In <em>Osoyoos</em>,
Iacobucci J. wrote that Aboriginal interests in land has an &ldquo;important
cultural component that reflects the relationship between an aboriginal
community and the land and the inherent and unique value in the land
itself which is enjoyed by the community&rdquo; (para. 46). The importance of
the interest in reserve land is heightened by the fact that, in many
cases such as this one, the reserve land was set aside as part of an
obligation that arose out of treaties between the Crown and Indigenous
Peoples.</p>
<p>The fiduciary duty imposes the following obligations on the
Crown: loyalty, good faith, full disclosure, and, where reserve land is
involved, the protection and preservation of the First Nation&rsquo;s
quasi-proprietary interest from exploitation (<em>Williams Lake</em>, at para.
46; <em>Wewaykum</em>, at para. 86). The standard of care is that of a person
of ordinary prudence in managing their own affairs (<em>Williams Lake</em>, at
para. 46). In the context of a surrender of reserve land, this Court has
recognized that the duty also requires that the Crown protect against
improvident bargains, manage the process to advance the best interests
of the First Nation, and ensure that it consents to the surrender
(<em>Blueberry River Indian Band v. Canada (Department of Indian Affairs
and Northern Development)</em>[1995] 4 S.C.R. 344, at paras. 35 and 96).
In an expropriation, the obligation to ensure consent is replaced by an
obligation to minimally impair the protected interest (<em>Osoyoos</em>, at
para. 54).</p>
<p>[<em>The Court went on to find that Canada breached its obligation to preserve and protect the LSFN’s interest in its reserve lands. This obligation included negotiating compensation based on the value of the land for the hydroelectricity project. The Court concluded that the LSFN was entitled to compensation for the opportunity it lost in negotiating an agreement based on this value.</em>]</p>
