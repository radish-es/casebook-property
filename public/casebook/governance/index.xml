Overview&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#i-overview&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This appeal calls upon the Court to clarify the circumstances in which state regulation of land use may effect a &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; or (as we will refer to it) “constructive” taking of private property.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The appellant, Annapolis Group Inc., contends that the respondent, Halifax Regional Municipality, improperly used its regulatory powers to effectively seize Annapolis’ land for use as a public park without compensation. Halifax says that Annapolis’ claim is a veiled attempt to make taxpayers foot the bill for a decades-long development gamble. It sought summary dismissal of this part of Annapolis’ claim, while permitting other claims (for misfeasance in public office and unjust enrichment) to proceed to trial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Belfast Corporation v OD Cars LTD</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;viscount-simonds-&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Viscount Simonds &amp;ndash;&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#viscount-simonds-&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--&#xA;&#xA; My Lords, the facts in this case, which give rise to some difficult questions, can be shortly stated. The respondents, a limited company registered in Belfast, own in fee farm certain land at Alexandra Park, Belfast. On buildings erected on that land, they have for many years carried on the business of garage proprietors and general motor engineers. On Feb. 9, 1954, they made an application to the appellants. the Belfast Corporation, for permission to erect on the land further industrial and commercial premises, viz., lock-up shops on Antrim Road and factories or warehouses on the back portion. The application was made pursuant to the provisions of s. 2 of the Planning (Interim Development) Act (Northern Ireland), 1944, to the appellants as the interim development authority. Such an application is known as an interim development application. I will refer later to this Act. On Mar. 2, 1954, the appellants refused the application on the ground (a) as to the lock-up shops, that the height and character of the proposed development would not be in accordance with their requirements for the site, namely, development to be in shops with dwellings over minimum height twenty-five feet, and (b) as to the industrial or commercial use of remainder of site, that the site was zoned as residential and that the character and user of the proposed development would be incompatible with such zoning. This refusal led to a claim for compensation for injurious affection under the Act which, in accordance with its provisions, was referred to the official arbitrator appointed thereunder. Before I narrate the proceedings which led to this appeal, I must refer to the relevant statutory provisions of the Planning and Housing Act (Northern Ireland), 1931, and the Planning (Interim Development) Act (Northern Ireland), 1944, which I will call the Act of 1931 and the Act of 1944. The former Act, after providing for the making of planning schemes to be prepared and adopted by local authorities and to be approved by the Minister and sundry other relevant matters, by s. 9 (1) enacted that any person whose property is injuriously affected by the coming into operation of a planning scheme shall, if he makes a claim for the purpose within the time therein mentioned, be entitled to obtain compensation in respect thereof from the responsible authority. But this right is subject to the limitation contained in s. 10, which provides, by sub-s. (1), that where property is alleged to be injuriously affected by reason of any provisions contained in a planning scheme, no compensation shall be paid in respect thereof if or so far as the provisions are also contained in any public, general or local Act in force in the area or otherwise as therein mentioned and, by sub-s. (2) (which is the subsection relevant to this appeal and must be set out verbatim), as follows:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; Property shall not be deemed to be injuriously affected by reason of the coming into operation of any provisions inserted in a planning scheme, which prescribe the space about buildings or limit the number of buildings to be erected, or prescribe the height or character or user of buildings, or prescribe a standard of net annual value for buildings, and which the Ministry, having regard to the nature and situation of the land affected by the provisions, considers reasonable for the purpose:&#xA;&#xA;Development under the Act of 1931 made slow progress and was in due course supplemented by the Act of 1944. Section 1 (1) of that Act deems all land which was not the subject of a planning scheme under the earlier Act, or of a resolution to prepare and adopt such a scheme, to be subject to a resolution to prepare a planning scheme under the Act. Section 2 directs the Ministry to make a general interim development order with respect to land to which such a resolution applies, and provides that such an order may empower any local authority specified therein to permit the development of land in accordance with the provisions thereof. In accordance with the duty thus placed on it, the Ministry, on July 10, 1944, made the Planning (General Interim Development) Order (Northern Ireland), 1944 (S.R. &amp; O. 1944 No. 58), which empowered the appellants to grant permission for the development of land within the county borough of Belfast. I need refer no more to the Act of 1944 except to set out the section, i.e., s. 6, under which, as I have already said, the respondents made the claim for compensation now under review. That section provided, by sub-s. (4), so far as material, as follows:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; Where ... an interim development application is refused ... then, the applicant ... shall, if he makes a claim for the purpose be entitled to obtain from the local authority such compensation in respect of any injurious affection of his property by reason of the aforesaid decision as he would be entitled to obtain under the principal Act [the Act of 1931] if such injurious affection had been suffered as a consequence of the coming into operation of a planning scheme...&#xA;&#xA;The claim for compensation having been made and refused on the grounds that I have stated, a number of questions were raised before the arbitrator which led him without proceeding to an award to state a consultative case for the opinion of the court in which he posed two questions as follows:&#xA;&#xA;&#34;(i) Whether I am entitled to award compensation to the claimant for injurious affection of the said land.&#34;&#xA;&#xA;&#34;(ii) Whether the evidence of Mr. A. P. Fitzgerald is suffcient to satisfy the requirements of s. 10 (2) of the Planning and Housing Act (Northern Ireland), 1931.&#34;&#xA;&#xA;The second question must appear at the present stage of my narrative somewhat cryptic. It is, in my opinion, of a formal character, and I will defer consideration of it until I have disposed of the important matters that arise under the first question. These are, first, a question arising on the construction of the Act of 1944, viz., whether s. 6 (4) of that Act incorporates a reference to s. 10 (2) of the Act of 1831 as well as to the compensatory provisions of s. 9, and, secondly, whether s. 10(2) is a valid enactment having regard to the provisions of s. 5 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920. The far-reaching importance of the second question is obvious.&#xA;&#xA;My Lords, on the first of these questions I entertain no doubt, and I cannot state the answer to it in a manner more clear and comprehensive than the learned Lord Chief Justice (Lord MacDermott) has done. Section 6 (4) of the later Act does incorporate s. 10 (2) of the earlier Act. I will not occupy your Lordships&#39; time by further reference to it.&#xA;&#xA;On the second question, viz., the constitutional validity of s. 10 (2) of the Act of 1931, I must say something more. For, though I agree with much that the Lord Chief Justice has said on this topic, there comes a point at which I must with great respect diverge from him. The issue turns on the true meaning and effect of s. 5 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920. Subsection (1) of that section is as follows:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; In the exercise of their power to make laws under this Act neither the Parliament of Southern Ireland nor the Parliament of Northern Ireland shall make a law so as either directly or indirectly to establish or endow any religion, or prohibit or restrict the free exercise thereof, or give a preference, privilege, or advantage, or impose any disability or disadvantage, on account of religious belief or religious or ecclesiastical status, or make any religious belief or religious ceremony a condition of the validity of any marriage, or affect prejudicially the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending the religious instruction at that school, or alter the constitution of any religious body except where the alteration is approved on behalf of the religious body by the governing body thereof, or divert from any religious denomination the fabric of cathedral churches, or, except for the purpose of roads, railways, lighting. water, or drainage works, or other works of public utility upon payment of compensation, any other property, or take any property without compensation.&#xA;&#xA;&gt; Any law made in contravention of the restrictions imposed by this subsection shall, so far as it contravenes those restrictions, be void.&#xA;&#xA;It was first urged on behalf of the appellants that the last five words of the first paragraph of this subsection referred only to the property of religious bodies or institutions. This point was decided against them twenty years ago in *O&#39;Neill v. Northern Ireland Road Transport Board*, and I do not doubt that that case was rightly decided. An argument founded on the historical genesis of these words, which was in any case of little weight, could not prevail against their plain meaning. Next, I must refer to an argument (though I am not clear which side could be assisted by it) that the words &#34;either directly or indirectly &#34; do not govern the last five words. But grammatically they clearly do, and I see no reason for not allowing grammatical laws to prevail. In any view, it is of no importance to this case.&#xA;&#xA;--&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A motion was made to consolidate these actions resulting in the choice of four cases which were to proceed and to be regarded as test actions, the others remaining in abeyance in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bundle of Sticks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When trying to explain the common law&amp;rsquo;s particular (and sometimes idiosyncratic) understanding of &amp;ldquo;ownership&amp;rdquo;, lawyers and judges frequently invoke the &amp;ldquo;bundle of sticks&amp;rdquo; metapho&amp;ndash;as in, &amp;ldquo;ownership is like a bundle of sticks&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;the &amp;ldquo;sticks&amp;rdquo; being the various property rights that make up the ownership &amp;ldquo;bundle&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea behind the metaphor is that ownership is not really a homogeneous collection of rights that one either holds (ownership) or does not hold (no ownership). Instead, ownership is a malleable legal concept, difficult to pin down to any particular arrangement or bundle. One landowner might have an unrestricted right to use their land in any way they like, while another might have certain use rights taken out of their ownership bundle—say, by a restrictive covenant that binds and runs with the land. We would likely call both an &amp;ldquo;owner&amp;rdquo;, even though they hold different sets of legal entitlements in practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

By virtue of the &lt;em&gt;Separate Schools Act&lt;/em&gt;, the Board of Trustees of the Roman Catholic Separate Schools for the city of Toronto (who will be referred to in this judgment as the “School Board”) have power to acquire or rent school sites and to build and carry on schools. By virtue of the &lt;em&gt;Municipal Act&lt;/em&gt;, the Corporation of the city of Toronto is empowered to prohibit by by-law the use of land or the erection or use of buildings within any defined area for any purpose other than that of a private residence. The question is whether, in the circumstances of this case, a by-law made by the Corporation under the latter statute is enforceable in respect of a site purchased by the School Board for school purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Remedies in nuisance are one legal tool used by property owners—with mixed success—to stop their neighbours from adversely affecting use and enjoyment of the owner&amp;rsquo;s land. Nuisance, in other words, is one means to exclude others from doing something that limits owners&amp;rsquo; freedom related to property. This means of exclusion, however, unavoidably limits the freedom of others to use their land as they choose. In these cases, the courts must choose not only whose rights should win out but also find some way to address the fundamental dilemma of conflicting freedoms inherent in legal liberalism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

P50, with four offences (one on each of four days) of unlawfully trespassing upon the premises of the Fairview Corporation Limited, trading under the firm name and style of Polo Park Shopping Centre, located in the City of Winnipeg, after having been requested by the owner not to enter on or come upon the premises. The appellant, Peter Harrison, manager of Polo Park Shopping Centre, swore the informations. The charges were dismissed by the Provincial Judge but on a trial de novo in the County Court Mrs. Carswell was convicted and fined $10 on each of the charges. The convictions were set aside by the Manitoba Court of Appeal [1974] 4 W.W.R. 394 (Freedman C.J.M. and Matas J.A., with Guy J.A. dissenting) and the present appeal followed by leave of this Court.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;mr-mccarthy-&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Mr. McCarthy —&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#mr-mccarthy-&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the House rose at six o&amp;rsquo;clock, I was proceeding to consider that part of the Bill which deals with compensation. Perhaps I might first be permitted to state, however, what I understand to be the meaning of the word &amp;ldquo;compensation,&amp;rdquo; when applied to the sovereign right of expropriation. Now, I do not pretend to dispute, and I am quite willing to admit in the amplest possible manner, so far as my judgement goes, that this &lt;em&gt;Act&lt;/em&gt; of Parliament was, subject to one consideration, within the power of the Local Legislature. If the one consideration be overlooked there is power in the Local Legislature as in every other sovereign body&amp;ndash;and the Local Legislature is sovereign so far as its jurisdiction extends&amp;ndash;to expropriate property for public purposes. But, Sir, as I understand the doctrine of expropriation, as we call it, or as it is better known on the other side of the line, the exercise of its power of &lt;em&gt;eminent domain&lt;/em&gt;, there are two limitations to the exercise of that power.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Introduction&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#i-introduction&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This case involves a collision of important interests. On one side, there are the interests of the respondents in the enjoyment of their privately owned land at Kingsburg Beach. On the other is the public interest in the protection and preservation of environmentally fragile and ecologically significant beach, dune and beach ridge resources. In the background of this case is the policy issue of how minutely government may control land without buying it. But in the foreground is the narrower issue of whether the stringent land use regulations applied by the Province to the respondents’ lands is an expropriation of them within the meaning of the &lt;em&gt;Expropriation Act&lt;/em&gt;, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 156.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

From one perspective, these waterways were akin to other types of public infrastructure (like roads and railways) necessary for rapidly expanding natural resource extraction and, eventually,  industrialization. In 1847, provincial legislation was passed to help ensure access to waterways in Upper Canada by lumber workers. The legislation stated that:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The main issue is whether it thereby breached the &lt;em&gt;Patent Act&lt;/em&gt;, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4. We believe that it did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize from the outset that we are not concerned here with the innocent discovery by farmers of “blow-by” patented plants on their land or in their cultivated fields. Nor are we concerned with the scope of the respondents’ patent or the wisdom and social utility of the genetic modification of genes and cells — a practice authorized by Parliament under the &lt;em&gt;Patent Act&lt;/em&gt; and its regulations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One right in particular, some argue, is fundamental to private property: the &lt;em&gt;right to exclude&lt;/em&gt; others from interfering with the owner&amp;rsquo;s use and enjoyment of their land, other tangible things and even intangibles like knowledge goods. The common law has devised several remedies to enforce owners&amp;rsquo; right to exclude. We have already seen two examples of this. In &lt;em&gt;Harrison v Carswell&lt;/em&gt;, the mall owner brought an action in &lt;em&gt;trespass&lt;/em&gt; against the picketer Sophie Carswell to exclude her from the mall sidewalk, while the plaintiff in &lt;em&gt;Moore&lt;/em&gt; made a claim in &lt;em&gt;conversion&lt;/em&gt; in his attempt to exclude the defendants from using his cells after they were extracted from his body. Both of these are causes of action in tort designed to protect the right to exclude.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Patents given their &amp;ldquo;owners&amp;rdquo; a time-limited, exclusive right to make, construct, use and sell the subject matter of the patent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The basic rationale behind patent rights is one about economic incentives. As an intangible good, the inventive idea or design that motivates a patent is by nature non-excludable: once the invention has been created and made public, it is essentially costless for others to reproduce that idea or design in order to make their own products. Because inventions often require considerable up-front and sometimes risky investments, the rationale goes, exclusive patent protections are needed in order provide creators with sufficient financial incentives to create in the first place. According to this argument, if the right to exclude via patent did not exists, creators would have no motivation to produce their intentions and society would suffer as a result.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The bill sets out a deed executed by the Coal Company in 1878, under which the plaintiffs claim. The deed conveys the surface, but, in express terms, reserves the right to remove all the coal under the same, and the grantee takes the premises with the risk, and waives all claim for damages that may arise from mining out the coal. But the plaintiffs say that, whatever may have been the Coal Company&amp;rsquo;s rights, they were taken away by an Act of Pennsylvania, approved May 27, 1921, P.L. 1198, commonly known there as the Kohler Act. The Court of Common Pleas found that, if not restrained, the defendant would cause the damage to prevent which the bill was brought, but denied an injunction, holding that the statute, if applied to this case, would be unconstitutional. On appeal, the Supreme Court of the State agreed that the defendant had contract and property rights protected by the Constitution of the United States, but held that the statute was a legitimate exercise of the police power, and directed a decree for the plaintiffs. A writ of error was granted bringing the case to this Court.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Certain &amp;ldquo;private&amp;rdquo; forms of land-use regulation are still in widespread use. One of the most pervasive—but often least noticed—is the &lt;em&gt;restrictive covenant&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From one point of view, restrictive covenants look like a fairly straightforward promise by one landowner to another—a promise to refrain from doing something on one&amp;rsquo;s own land. One landowner might promise not to cut down the trees in their yard, for example, or promise not to paint their house a garish shade of bright green. But from a legal perspective, restrictive covenants are much more than this. Not only do covenants represent a sort of contractual promise between parties, they help to define the durable &amp;ldquo;bundle of rights&amp;rdquo; in the land itself—that is, covenants are said to &lt;em&gt;run with the land&lt;/em&gt; and can, at least in theory, long outlast the original parties to the covenant. This possibility raises some difficult questions for courts in how they define the basic character of covenants along with their consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;riparian owner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; is the owner of land bounding upon a river or other watercourse. The traditional presumption of English common law is that a riparian owner owns the bed of a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;non-navigable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; river or stream to the centre of the watercourse: &lt;em&gt;ad medium filum aquae&lt;/em&gt;. Consequently, a riparian owner who holds land on both sides of a river considered &amp;ldquo;non-navigable&amp;rdquo; owns the entire riverbed and has exclusive rights to the river&amp;rsquo;s use .&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As the case arises in Quebec, the specific issue raised is the limitation of previously acquired rights under the &lt;em&gt;Civil Code&lt;/em&gt;. However, as this is a &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; law matter, the principles of land use regulation applicable in the common law provinces concerning legal non-conforming uses are also relevant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The defendant in this case, the City of London Electric Lighting Company, operated large engines and other heavy machinery that caused damage to the foundations of a pub, the Waterman&amp;rsquo;s Arms, leased by the plaintiff, Shelfer, as well as a lot of noise and other &amp;ldquo;annoyances&amp;rdquo;. There was no question about the existence of the nuisance—the only issue before the court was what type of remedy should be available to the plaintiff.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the more remarkable aspects of the decision in &lt;em&gt;Re Drummond Wren&lt;/em&gt; is its reliance on different sources of domestic and international law to ground the Court&amp;rsquo;s finding that the restrictive covenant in issue was contrary to public policy. As you analyze the &lt;em&gt;3000 Funston Street&lt;/em&gt; problem for this week, consider what role the following sources might play.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Article 11 of the United Nations General Assembly&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights&lt;/em&gt; (1966) recognizes:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The name of the most familiar tort protecting real property, trespass, was originally the name of an entire family of actions that first emerged in the 12th and 13th centuries. A plaintiff would commence his case by going to the royal Chancery and purchasing a writ commanding the defendant to come before the courts and explain why he had done such-and-such a thing against the plaintiff’s rights. The Latin phrases used by the Chancery clerks who filled out the writs – and which the royal courts insisted on when hearing a case – came to define individual forms of action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the year 1808 the Plaintiff, being then the owner in fee of the vacant piece of ground in Leicester Square, as well as of several of the houses forming the Square, sold the piece of ground by the description of &amp;ldquo;Leicester Square garden or pleasure ground, with the equestrian statue then standing in the centre thereof, and the iron railing and stone work round the same,&amp;rdquo; to one Elms in fee: and the deed of conveyance contained a covenant by Elms, for himself, his heirs, and assigns, with the Plaintiff, his heirs, executors, and administrators, &amp;ldquo;that Elms, his heirs, and assigns should, and would from time to time, and at all times thereafter at his and their own costs and charges, keep and maintain the said piece of ground and square garden, and the iron railing round the same in its then form, and in sufficient and proper repair as a square garden and pleasure ground, in an open state, uncovered with any buildings, in neat and ornamental order; and that it should be lawful for the inhabitants of Leicester Square, tenants of the Plaintiff, on payment of a reasonable rent for the same, to have keys at their own expense and the privilege of admission therewith at any time or times into the said square garden and pleasure ground.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Victoria Park Racing and Recreational Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor </title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;latham-cj-&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Latham C.J. —&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#latham-cj-&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is an appeal from a judgment for the defendants given by Nicholas J. in an action by the Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co Ltd against Taylor and others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiff company carries on the business of racing upon a racecourse known as Victoria Park. The defendant Taylor is the owner of land near the racecourse. He has placed an elevated platform on his land from which it is possible to see what takes place on the racecourse and to read the information which appears on notice boards on the course as to the starters, scratchings, etc, and the winners of the races. The defendant Angles stands on the platform and through a telephone comments upon and describes the races in a particularly vivid manner and announces the names of the winning horses. The defendant the Commonwealth Broadcasting Corporation holds a broadcasting licence under the regulations made under the &lt;em&gt;Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905-1936&lt;/em&gt; and carries on the business of broadcasting from station 2 UW. This station broadcasts the commentaries and descriptions given by Angles. The plaintiff wants to have the broadcasting stopped because it prevents people from going to the races and paying for admission. The evidence shows that some people prefer hearing about the races as seen by Angles to seeing the races for themselves. The plaintiff contends that the damage which it thus suffers gives, in all the circumstances, a cause of action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
