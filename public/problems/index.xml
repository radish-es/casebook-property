      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Mi&amp;rsquo;kmaw hunter pursued a fox (&lt;em&gt;wowkwis&lt;/em&gt;, in Mi&amp;rsquo;kmaq) during a long morning hunt across a large tract forest land on the Eastern Shore of Mi&amp;rsquo;kmaki (Nova Scotia) called &lt;em&gt;Sebelogwokun&lt;/em&gt; (&amp;ldquo;where skins are stretched&amp;rdquo;). After several hours, the hunter eventually shot and mortally wounded the &lt;em&gt;wowkiws&lt;/em&gt; within the boundaries of Fox Island Main Beach, which is provincial Crown Land (i.e. land &amp;ldquo;vested in the Crown&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;under the administration and control of the Minister&amp;rdquo; of Lands and Forests pursuant to the &lt;em&gt;Crown Lands Act&lt;/em&gt;, RSNS 1989, c 114, s 9) and designed under the provincial &lt;em&gt;Beaches Act&lt;/em&gt;, RSNS 1989, c 32.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the events of the &lt;a href=&#34;&#34; &gt;protest at West Eggleston&lt;/a&gt;, some MLAs and their allies began to pressure the provincial government to expand access to places where members of the public can engage in peaceful protest and other forms of collective association. As a result of these efforts, the legislature passed an amendment to the &lt;em&gt;Public Highways Act&lt;/em&gt;, RSNS 1989, c 371 which reads:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;5A Where members of the public are exercising their freedom of collective association on roads, lanes, paths or highways, the provisions of the &lt;em&gt;Protection of Property Act&lt;/em&gt;, RSNS 1989, c 363 are of no force or effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To that end, I have provided a list of &amp;ldquo;rapid review&amp;rdquo; questions for you to read and consider. I don’t suggest that you address them all in full detail. Instead, read each and consider your answer for no more than a minute or two. You can come back to these questions in more detail as part of your exam preparation&amp;ndash;their purpose at this point is only to provide a check on what you&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far and to help you to discover where you can most effectively focus your studying.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recall from our first problem this term, &lt;a href=&#34;&#34; &gt;protest at West Eggleston&lt;/a&gt;, that the community has been experiencing significant changes in the past few years. Rising housing price across the province have increased demand for land in West Egg dramatically. With its idyllic setting along the coast, several of the co-operative&amp;rsquo;s founding members worried that their community had lost sight of its roots in affordable housing and would eventually become nothing more than another tony suburb for wealthy. As we saw in our earlier problem, these dynamics had already begun to fracture the community and raised mounting concerns about exclusion and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1944, Toyo Takahashi, a Japanese Canadian woman, wrote the following letter to Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, protesting the forced sale of her home in Victoria, British Columbia under the wartime legal regime that had emerged to dispossess Japanese Canadians of their property and &amp;ldquo;liquidate&amp;rdquo; their belongings:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dear Sir:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Director of the Office of the Custodian in Vancouver has notified us of your policy of liquidation of Japanese property. Because of this policy my property has now been catalogued for sale. This liquidation is against your promises, and my wishes, furthermore it is utterly undeserved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following hypothetical builds on a recent case before the Manitoba Court of Appeal,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; which reports these facts:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Maze in Corn Inc. operates a corn maze, petting zoo and haunted forest attraction (the business) on a property located on St. Mary&amp;rsquo;s Road, south of Winnipeg near St. Adolphe (the property). The property is located south of the gates of the Red River Floodway (the floodway).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Red River runs through the City of Winnipeg, which is located on the Red River flood plain. In years of unusually high water, the river overflows its banks and causes widespread flooding and sewer back-ups in Winnipeg, resulting in significant property damage and economic loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Please read &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/indian-act-horrible-existence-senator-christmas-1.4149551&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;this CBC News article,&lt;/a&gt; in which former Senator Dan Christmas, the first Mi&amp;rsquo;kmaw member of the Canadian Senate, describes challenges the Membertou First Nation has faced with respect to lands governance under the federal &lt;em&gt;Indian Act&lt;/em&gt; and how his community has responded to these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the article notes, Membertou has recently opted out of the lands-related provisions of the &lt;em&gt;Indian Act&lt;/em&gt; and opted into an alternative federal regime under the &lt;em&gt;First Nations Lands Management Act&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;FNLMA&lt;/em&gt;). This legislation was subsequently repealed in 2022 and replaced by the &lt;em&gt;Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management Act&lt;/em&gt;, SC 2022, c 19 (&lt;em&gt;FAFNLMA&lt;/em&gt;). The &lt;em&gt;FAFNLMA&lt;/em&gt; gives effect to the Framework Agreement on First Nations Land Management, which empowers participating First Nations to create their own Land Code dealing with property and lands-related governance on their reserve lands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
