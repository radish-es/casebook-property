Please read the facts carefully, followed by the linked reading material, and think about whether or not a court would be likely to find that the protestors are &amp;lsquo;guilty of an offence&amp;rsquo; and &amp;rsquo;liable to a fine of not more than five hundred dollars.&amp;rsquo;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After the events of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/problems/protest/&#34; &gt;protest at West Eggleston&lt;/a&gt;, some MLAs and their allies began to pressure the provincial government to expand access to places where members of the public can engage in peaceful protest and other forms of collective association. As a result of these efforts, the legislature passed an amendment to the &lt;em&gt;Public Highways Act&lt;/em&gt;, RSNS 1989, c 371 which reads:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;5A Where members of the public are exercising their freedom of collective association on roads, lanes, paths or highways, the provisions of the &lt;em&gt;Protection of Property Act&lt;/em&gt;, RSNS 1989, c 363 are of no force or effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recall from our first problem this term, &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/problems/protest/&#34; &gt;protest at West Eggleston&lt;/a&gt;, that the community has been experiencing significant changes in the past few years. Rising housing price across the province have increased demand for land in West Egg dramatically. With its idyllic setting along the coast, several of the co-operative&amp;rsquo;s founding members worried that their community had lost sight of its roots in affordable housing and would eventually become nothing more than another tony suburb for wealthy. As we saw in our earlier problem, these dynamics had already begun to fracture the community and raised mounting concerns about exclusion and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1944, Toyo Takahashi, a Japanese Canadian woman, wrote the following letter to Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, protesting the forced sale of her home in Victoria, British Columbia under the wartime legal regime that had emerged to dispossess Japanese Canadians of their property and &amp;ldquo;liquidate&amp;rdquo; their belongings:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dear Sir:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Director of the Office of the Custodian in Vancouver has notified us of your policy of liquidation of Japanese property. Because of this policy my property has now been catalogued for sale. This liquidation is against your promises, and my wishes, furthermore it is utterly undeserved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The property is located south of the gates of the Red River Floodway (the floodway).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Red River runs through the City of Winnipeg, which is located on the Red River flood plain. In years of unusually high water, the river overflows its banks and causes widespread flooding and sewer back-ups in Winnipeg, resulting in significant property damage and economic loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This legislation was subsequently repealed in 2022 and replaced by the &lt;em&gt;Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management Act&lt;/em&gt;, SC 2022, c 19 (&lt;em&gt;FAFNLMA&lt;/em&gt;). The &lt;em&gt;FAFNLMA&lt;/em&gt; gives effect to the Framework Agreement on First Nations Land Management, which empowers participating First Nations to create their own Land Code dealing with property and lands-related governance on their reserve lands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In October 2003, the Government of Nova Scotia introduced a bill with proposed amendments to automobile insurance laws in the province. The bill was drafted to address the growing cost of automobile insurance for people who own and drive cars. In Nova Scotia, automobile insurance is provided by private firms. Some of the proposed amendments included a temporary cap on insurance rates, a requirement that the Nova Scotia Insurance Review Board approve the way that insurers classify risk (which determines how much individuals in each class pay for insurance), and a cap on the amount of non-monetary loss (such as for pain and suffering) that insured people can claim for minor injuries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The will establishes a private trust whose terms stipulate that, in order for the eldest of the two children to receive their share of the estate property they must divorce and cease to cohabitate with their spouse. If the eldest child fails to meet this condition within five years of the testator&amp;rsquo;s decease, the whole residue of the estate will pass to the other beneficiary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To better understand some of the challenges associated with creating a meaningful land acknowledgement, consider a recent controversy in Wolastoqey territory. In October of 2021, New Brunswick&amp;rsquo;s Attorney General issued a memo to provincial employees called &amp;ldquo;First Nation Protocol on Acknowledging Ancestral Territory.&amp;rdquo; The memo was purportedly a response to the Wolastoqey Nation&amp;rsquo;s ongoing claim, in the Canadian courts, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/wolastoqey-nation-filing-for-title-claim-against-new-brunswick-1.5750955&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;for recognition of Aboriginal title to land that covers about half of present day New Brunswick&lt;/a&gt; (we will examine the details of this kind of claim later in the course). In the memo, provincial employees were instructed not to give territorial or title acknowledgements in the context of their work. Instead, they were to use only an approved &amp;ldquo;ancestral acknowledgement&amp;rdquo; as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Attempts by the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) to prevent development on private lands next to the wilderness area have made landowners unhappy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Blue Mountain-Birch Cove was designated as a provincially-protected wilderness area in 2009. It started as 1,316 hectares of Crown land and was later expanded, in 2015, to 1,767 hectares. Several private landowners own undeveloped lands adjacent to the protected area. One of those landowners is the Annapolis Group Inc. (Annapolis), whose undeveloped lands have remained essentially wilderness since Annapolis began to acquire them sometime in the middle of the last century.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing over a decade after his decision in &lt;em&gt;Black v Canadian Copper Co.&lt;/em&gt;, Justice Middleton&amp;ndash;now at the Ontario Court of Appeal&amp;ndash;took a different approach to the question of remedy for nuisance in &lt;em&gt;Duchman v Oakland Dairy&lt;/em&gt;. In Duchman, the plaintiffs brought an action against a neighbouring dairy operation in Toronto, claiming that the noise caused in the early mornings interfered with plaintiffs&amp;rsquo; and their families&amp;rsquo; sleep. The plaintiffs complained of &amp;ldquo;the constant noise resulting from the loading and unloading of the defendants&amp;rsquo; wagons and motor-trucks; the stamping and kicking of the defendants&amp;rsquo; horses; the rattling of the wagons and trucks and their contents; and the yelling of the defendant company&amp;rsquo;s servants and employees while engaged in their duties.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In November 2016, Elsipogtog First Nation filed a Notice of Action and Statement of Claim in the New Brunswick Court of Queen&amp;rsquo;s Bench. The following quotes from the press release issued by Elsipogtog in advance of that filing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On November 9, 2016 Elsipogtog First Nation is filing a claim on behalf of the Mi’kmaq Nation for Aboriginal title to the Mi’kma’ki district of Sikniktuk in New Brunswick.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“This claim is about protecting our lands and waters for our children and our future generations,” said Elsipogtog Chief Arren Sock. “We cannot stand by while the government ignores us and makes decisions that threaten the traditional lands of the Mi’kmaq people. It’s time for us to exercise our rights and responsibilities to protect our territory.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Land Title Clarification in African Nova Scotian Communities</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The context for our case study this week is described in two excerpts below from recent decisions of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. Both cases address provincial legislation called the &lt;em&gt;Land Titles Clarification Act&lt;/em&gt;, RSNS 1989, c 250, through which individuals in possession of land can apply to have their land title &amp;ldquo;clarified&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;that is, given formal legal recognition&amp;ndash;where title does not exist or is uncertain. The excerpts from &lt;em&gt;Downey&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Beals&lt;/em&gt;, below, sketch the basic features of this legislation and its connection to the historical settlement of African Nova Scotians.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Locke and Colonialism</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/problems/locke-colonialism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Several writers have explored and debated the ways in which Locke&amp;rsquo;s influential works sought to justify an expanding British colonialism at the time when the &lt;em&gt;Second Treatise&lt;/em&gt; was published. As part of that project, questions about property and possession of land were fundamental. While Locke appears to acknowledge that British law may recognize the possession of Indigenous peoples, he simultaneously lays down justifications for undermining any possessory entitlements&amp;ndash;or for ignoring them altogether.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Consider in particular the judges&amp;rsquo; debate over &amp;ldquo;policy reasons&amp;rdquo; for extending conversion liability to biological cells (the &lt;a href=&#34;#green_1&#34; &gt;green argument pair&lt;/a&gt; in the decisions above).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To what extent does this debate rest on the three pervasive assumptions (natural, neutral and necessary) about law and markets (here, a market in biological cells) that we discussed in Week 1? Having identified the work of these assumptions in the case, how might you critique the judges&amp;rsquo; shared approach to the debate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Multi-juridical Canada and Jeremy Dutcher&#39;s Musical Dialogues</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have seen this week and last how judges in the style of classical common law thought largely foreclosed any genuine consideration of Indigenous laws or of a multi-juridical Canada. Later in the course, we will return to this idea and ask about possibilities for intersections between legal orders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you start to think about this question, consider the work and music of Wolastoqiyik artist Jeremy Dutcher, a member of the Tobique First Nation (Neqotkuk) who released his Juno and Polaris prize-winning album &lt;em&gt;Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa&lt;/em&gt; in 2018. Dutcher, who trained as an operatic tenor at Dalhousie, recorded the album entirely in Wolastoqey as part of a project that brings the artist into a kind of musical dialogue with ancestral voices from his community singing traditional songs that were recorded by the anthropologist William Mechling on wax cylinders between 1907 and 1914.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this exercise, start by taking some time to think about the obligations you bring to this property law course. You might want to start by thinking about what obligations have confront by coming to class each week. What gets you out of your home and into the law school? What responsibilities do you encounter as you try to understanding and complete your weekly readings (and to whom)? Below are some further questions to help guide your reflections. Take around ten minutes to make a list of all the relevant obligations that come to your mind in this context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Erecting a fence is a quintessential  way of marking something as &amp;ldquo;mine&amp;rdquo;, and generally sends a clear message to others to &amp;ldquo;keep out&amp;rdquo;. What other practices do we understand as signalling possession? Are these practices always meant to be recognized in the eyes of the law, or do they have other audiences?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They both run for it. The faster one nearly reaches the vessel but trips on a piece of driftwood and sprains their ankle. The second child then overtakes the first, jumps on board and declares the boat &amp;ldquo;mine!&amp;rdquo;. Who owns the boat?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Various legal rules, from criminal law statutes to tort principles, aim to protect a person&amp;rsquo;s bodily integrity from harm or intrusion. But in some circumstances, a person&amp;rsquo;s biological cells might be removed or become detached from their body. Once those cells are separated from the body of a living person, this opens up the possibility that the law might regard them as the subject of property.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of Week 14, we discussed the Supreme Court&amp;rsquo;s resistance in &lt;em&gt;Noble and Wolf v Alley&lt;/em&gt; to apply the public policy doctrine to invalidate a discriminatory restrictive covenant. Despite Justice Mackay&amp;rsquo;s robust engagement with this doctrine in &lt;em&gt;Re Drummond Wren&lt;/em&gt;, it would not receive sustained attention by the Canadian courts until more than three decades later. The Ontario Court of Appeal returned to the challenge of applying the public policy doctrine to &amp;ldquo;private&amp;rdquo; property arrangements in &lt;em&gt;Canada Trust Co v Ontario (Human Rights Commission)&lt;/em&gt;, in the context of a testamentary bequest via a charitable trust.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Why or why not?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What changed in &lt;em&gt;Annapolis Group Inc v Halifax Regional Municipality&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suppose that Annapolis Group Inc. is a land development company incorporated in the United States or Mexico. How might the results of its claim to &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; (or &amp;ldquo;indirect&amp;rdquo;) expropriation differ if it were to make a claim under Article 1110 of &lt;em&gt;NAFA&lt;/em&gt; rather than in Canada&amp;rsquo;s domestic courts (which it could still do as a legacy claim until July 2022)? How would it differ under &lt;em&gt;CUSMA&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

According to the HRM website:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Short-Term Rentals (STRs) are temporary overnight accommodations rented out for a few nights or weeks at a time. In recent years, the prevalence and popularity of STRs has grown through online platforms like Airbnb, VRBO and HomeAway. While STRs provide a unique form of a tourist accommodation and can have benefits for the local economy, their recent popularity raises concerns about their impact on residential neighborhoods and the availability of properties for long-term rental [i.e. the rental housing supply].&lt;/p&gt;</description>
