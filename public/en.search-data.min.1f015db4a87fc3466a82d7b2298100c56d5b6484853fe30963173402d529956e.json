The course is taught by Professor Jamie Baxter at the Schulich School of Law, Dalhousie University.\nGeneral Information # Contact Details # Please contact me by e-mail (jamie.baxter@dal.ca) about all matters related to the course. My office is Weldon 326.\nAdministration # Information about course requirements and procedures can be found in this document and the in the Course Schedule. Both of these documents are available in the \u0026ldquo;Admin\u0026rdquo; section of the course website.\nThe Course Schedule may be amended during the year as needed. Please refer to the online versions of this document (rather than print-outs or local copies) for the most up-to-date information.\nClass Meeting Schedule # Our weekly meeting schedule is Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:35AM to 10:55AM in W204. Please see the Course Schedule for details about class meetings.\nClass Meeting Format # We will aim to hold all of our class meetings in a hybrid format. This means that, when meeting in person, I plan to live stream that meeting via Zoom. Students attending remotely are encouraged to participate in the meeting via the chat function. From time to time, we may conduct a meeting entirely online when circumstances require.\nPlease be aware that class meetings will be recorded, consistent with the Dalhousie Class Recording Protocol. By engaging in course activities, you are consenting to the use of your appearance, image, text/chat messaging, and voice and/or likeness in the manner and under the conditions specified in this syllabus. If you have any concerns about privacy, please speak with me.\nIf you are unable to attend a scheduled session in person or online, please get in touch with me to access a recording of the session (student recordings are not permitted\u0026ndash;please see below). Recordings are intended only for enrolled students in the course and for their own personal academic use. Class recordings will be sent by me via a secure email link and are only to be used for the duration of the course. I will destroy the recordings at the end of the semester. Students receiving recordings are not permitted to share, make copies of, or download the recordings for any purpose, without written permission from me.\nThese measures are in place to improve equitable access for all students, recognizing that everyone comes to the course with their own needs.\nSupport Outside the Classroom # I want you to feel well supported in this course, both in class meetings and outside the classroom. I recognize that this support may take different forms for different students, so please get in touch with me to discuss what you need to be successful in the course.\nAs a baseline, I will hold scheduled drop-in office hours weekly on Tuesdays from 1:30PM to 2:30PM. These meetings may be in person or virtual, depending on preference and availability. The last day for drop-in office hours for the fall term is November 26, 2024. The last day for drop-in office hours for the winter term is March 25, 2025.\nIf you have questions about the course material outside of class meetings, you must bring these questions to me during office hours. As a general policy, I won\u0026rsquo;t answer substantive questions about the course material by e-mail.\nThis policy exists mainly to avoid a flood of last minute e-mails before exams, but it also pushes you to plan ahead in your studying. To get the most out of office hour appointments, plan to dedicate some time to ongoing review of the course content during the term and contact me with your questions as they arise. I know that this can be a challenge as the term gets busy, but the benefits of even 20 or 30 mins of periodic review will pay off enormously at the end of term.\nYou must send the questions you would like to discuss during office hours via email to jamie.baxter@dal.ca at least one hour prior to the office hour session you plan to attend. This lets me know that you are coming, helps you to focus the discussion, and gives me a chance to think through your questions ahead of time.\nI am also happy to schedule small group meetings if you\u0026rsquo;d like to meet in this format \u0026ndash; please e-mail to arrange a time.\nCommunications About the Course # All communication from me to you about the course will be via an Announcement posted on Brightspace. Please ensure that you have e-mail notifications enabled for Brightspace Announcements — this way, you will receive a copy of each announcement in your inbox when it is posted. I will assume that you have received and read all course information posted via an Announcement on Brightspace after October 1, 2024.\nAll e-mail messages to me about the course should include in the subject line the course name and a concise statement of purpose (e.g. Property: Questions for office hours). Please remember that e-mail is not an alternative to meeting with me using the procedure described above if you have questions about the course content.\nCourse Materials, Goals and Expectations # Online Casebook and Course Materials # All materials for this course are available online at www.opensourcelaw.ca The materials are free to access; you do not need to purchase a casebook or other materials for the course.\nRequired readings for the course are assigned on a weekly basis — please consult the Course Schedule. Because of the casebook\u0026rsquo;s unique format, you will only see new material (along with links to existing material) after that new material is assigned.\nOnline versions of the weekly readings, posted on the course website, may contain interactive elements (instructional notes, podcasts, screencasts, quizzes, etc), so please aim to read these materials on your computer or tablet when possible. If you have any accessibility concerns about this format please don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to contact me. The course materials have been created and published under an open license (except where otherwise noted). This means that the materials are available to anyone to access, copy, redistribute, remix, and build upon for non-commercial purposes under the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence.\nCourse Goals and Expectations # I have designed this course with two big goals in mind.\nThe first goal is skills-based: you will learn to navigate and critically analyze the structure of arguments and reasoning employed by jurists (lawyers, judges and others). Our emphasis (in terms of time spent) will be on the Anglo-Canadian / common law system, but we will develop this emphasis comparatively with other legal systems and with careful attention to relationships between them. You will certainly need to learn some basic rules of property law and how to make arguments using legal rules, but you will need to go beyond the rules and arguments by situating them in deeper structures and styles of reasoning. We will spend a lot of time looking at exactly how these \u0026ldquo;structures\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;styles\u0026rdquo; work throughout the course. Doing all this will require you, as the course title suggests, to develop an understanding of historical context — namely, how both the rules and patterns of reasoning have changed and are changing over time.\nThis leads to the second goal, which is to situate property in its political-economic context - especially over the past few hundred years. More specifically, I want each of you to leave this course with a thoughtful answer to the question of how property laws have created and reproduced Canada’s particular liberal market economy and defined its consequences for different communities and individuals over time. It is important to keep in mind throughout the course that these consequences produce tremendous benefits for some and enormous \u0026ldquo;costs\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash;including violence, displacement and other forms of individual and collective/inter-generational harm\u0026ndash;to others.\nLearning all this is hard work, and this means that I have high expectations of you—both in class and on exams. I demand a lot from you because I want to prepare you as thoughtful and critical professionals, whether in law or in other pursuits. I value the diversity of experience and insight that you bring to studying law and I believe that each of you can meet these expectations.\nClass Preparation, Meetings and Methods # Your preparation for, attendance and active engagement are crucial for succeeding in this course. We have a limited time each week to spend together, and you are all very busy people. We want to ensure that we use the time together as effectively as possible.\nFor each class meeting I ask that you:\nbe well prepared, having worked through the online materials in advance of the first class each week;\nbring your computer or tablet to class if attending in person so that you can access the online materials;\nfocus your attention on the material and limit any distractions as much as possible; and\nparticipate actively in class discussions and exercises.\nWe will use a variety of teaching/learning methods to achieve the goals for this course, to keep things interesting, and to accommodate various learning styles. I ask for you patience if/when I am using a style that works for others, but not for you.\nStudent Recordings # You are not permitted to record class meetings. The unauthorized use of any form of device to audiotape, photograph, video-record or otherwise reproduce lectures is prohibited. You must obtain prior written consent to any such recording. Exceptions may be granted in cases of private use for reason of accommodation.\nEvaluation # You will be evaluated in this course based on take-home, open-book examinations. In December, there will be a ‘fail-safe’ exam. If you get a higher mark on your April exam, your April mark will be your final mark. If you get a higher mark on your December exam, the December mark will count for 30% of your final grade. The December and April exams are both open book and each will take place during a scheduled 8-hour take-home period. Your December Property exam is scheduled by the Associate Dean\u0026rsquo;s office for December 18, 2024. Your April Property exam is scheduled for April 14, 2025.\nAll examinations will be written on computer. Further information will be sent from the Associate Dean’s Office. Rules governing exams are included in the Academic Calendar.\nLaw School and University Policies # Academic Integrity # At Dalhousie University, we are guided in all our work by the values of academic integrity: honesty, trust, fairness, responsibility and respect. As a student, you are required to demonstrate these values in all the work you do. The University provides policies and procedures that every member of the university community is required to follow to ensure academic integrity. All students must read the University policies on plagiarism and academic honesty.\nUsing your own previously submitted, or concomitant work for another course, constitutes plagiarism. Plagiarism is considered a serious academic offence which may lead to loss of credit, suspension or expulsion from the law school, or even revocation of a degree. It is essential that there be correct attribution of authorities from which facts and opinions have been derived. Prior to submitting any paper or other assignment, students should read and familiarize themselves with the policies referred to above and should consult with the instructor if they have any questions. Ignorance of the policies on plagiarism will not excuse any violation of those policies.\nThe course instructor may use Dalhousie’s approved originality checking software and Google to check the originality of any work submitted for credit, in accordance with the Student Submission of Assignments and Use of Originality Checking Software Policy. Students are free, without penalty of grade, to choose an alternative method of attesting to the authenticity of their work and must inform the instructor no later than the last day to add/drop classes of their intent to choose an alternate method.

Students can also access a range of support services and resources through Dalhousie University, including ones related to Health and Wellness.\nAccessibility and Accommodations # The Dalhousie Student Accessibility Centre (SAC) is responsible for administering the university-wide Student Accommodation Policy working across all faculties, including the Schulich School of Law. Individual professors cannot grant accommodation requests.\nAccommodation is introduced when a protected characteristic, including mental health related conditions, (as defined by provincial human rights legislation) may place you at a disadvantage compared to other students who are not affected by a protected characteristic and if there are aspects of the design, instruction, and or experiences within this course that result in barriers to your inclusion.\nStudents request accommodation prior to the start of the academic term or as soon as a barrier is identified. As stated in the Law academic regulations, retroactive accommodation will not be granted. Law academic regulations can be consulted in detail in the Faculty Regulations section of the Dentistry Law Medicine Academic Calendar.\nPlease click here to request accommodation.\nAcademic Dispensation # Students experiencing sudden illness or crisis are asked to request an academic dispensation via the My Schulich portal. Academic Dispensation is granted specifically for compassionate grounds or unforeseen medical circumstances; Academic Dispensation is not granted for multiple deadlines, student travel, failure to plan, or activities related to formal recruitment and job interviews.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/lessons/week01/","title":"Introduction to the Course","section":"Lessons","content":"For first-year law students, \u0026ldquo;property\u0026rdquo; can be a kaleidoscopic subject: fragmentary, blinkered, disorienting. As one (among many) possible ways of mediating our relationships with and in respect of land and other \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash;both corporeal and not\u0026ndash;property offers up a disorderly patchwork of principles, rules and norms. It is full of contradictions, real and apparent. It presents a space of dispossession and disadvantage for some, prosperity and security for others.\nThere are likewise many ways to teach and learn about property, to try to make sense of and bring some order within the kaleidoscope. In this course, we will approach the subject from a historical perspective–one that puts the critical emphasis on the role of land relationships in Canada’s political economy as the legal ground that determines so much about who benefits from the economic system and who does not.\nThis first week of the course introduces you to the core method of problem-based learning in the course and starts to develop some of the key questions and themes that we will explore throughout the year.\nRead the Syllabus # Before you start to explore the course materials, please familiarize yourself with the procedures and expectations for our course this year. Start by reading the Course Syllabus and reviewing the Course Schedule. These are the main documents you\u0026rsquo;ll need to use throughout the year to understand the course logistics, expectations, policies and schedule for assigned readings and class meetings.\nAim to begin this week with a good understanding of:\nCourse procedures for communicating with me and arranging appointments outside of class meetings;\nHow to access the course website and assigned materials;\nGoals and expectations for class preparation and participation in class meetings;\nHow you will be evaluated in the course; and\nYour rights and responsibilities related to accessibility and accommodations.\nI will highlight some key points from these materials at the beginning of this week\u0026rsquo;s class meeting and will make time for your questions about the syllabus.\nProblem-Based, Hypertext Learning # You will quickly notice that this casebook looks quite different from most of the other legal casebooks you are using in first year. One feature is that the casebook is fully digital and freely accessible online. But more importantly, the book is organized around two distinctive approaches to legal learning:\nProblem-based learning: all of your reading and our classroom meetings will be based on problems \u0026ndash; both hypothetical or drawn from real-world events, or some mix of the two. These problems are designed to help you focus on how to use the course materials (cases, statues, articles, etc) to identify relevant legal questions and to encourage you to explore different ways to answer those questions.\nHypertext: rather than working through a linear progression of reading material, as in a printed book, this casebook requires you to follow pathways of connection (links) between different components of the course. As a result of this structure, there is no single order in which to engage the course materials that are assigned weekly. Part of what you will be asked to do in this course is to develop your own understanding of how each piece or component is connected to each other and to the whole. The practice of working with material in this way is a critical one for legal analysis.\nOur First Problem # Instead of spending a lot of time up front on formal or abstract concepts, our plan for this first week is to jump right into the practice of analyzing problems. Start by reading our first problem for the course: Protest at West Eggleston. From there, please review and take notes on the linked \u0026ldquo;Related Reading\u0026rdquo; that appears in the right-hand column on each page.\nYou may choose to read the assigned material in any order you choose, by following the links on each page. But please note that all of the material assigned is mandatory; you should complete all of it before our first class of the week. This week, that includes Harrison v Carswell, the Protection of Property Act and two concepts that describe \u0026ldquo;Trespass to Land\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Styles of Argument\u0026rdquo;.\n\u0026ldquo;External\u0026rdquo; links (outside the casebook website, e.g., to news articles, reports, or statistics) are optional reading material for your own interest and context, unless otherwise noted.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/problems/protest/","title":"Protest at West Eggleston","section":"Problems","content":"West Eggleston (\u0026ldquo;West Egg\u0026rdquo;, for short) is a small, coastal residential community in rural Nova Scotia that recently attracted a short-lived but very public protest outside its gates.\nThe land in West Egg has a long history and involves a complicated web of legal relationships. West Egg itself was built in the early 1970s by a group of people worried about the rising cost of housing in their region. The group incorporated a small co-operative organization and raised enough money to purchase the twenty-five hectares on which West Egg now stands from a real estate developer then facing insolvency. The co-operative went on to develop housing on the land and sold off individual plots at below-market prices to individual purchasers but retained ownership of the infrastructure (roads, water and sewer, parks, etc), which it continues to own and operate for the benefit of the residents. The co-op\u0026rsquo;s Board and its membership are comprised entirely of community residents.\nOver time, as housing prices across Nova Scotia continued to rise\u0026ndash;especially in the city\u0026ndash;demand for the comparatively affordable plots in West Egg skyrocketed. Wealthier individuals started to move in and build larger, pricier houses. Using their growing influence among the co-op\u0026rsquo;s membership, they also began to push for new community amenities. A few years ago, the co-op voted to install a large wrought-iron gate about half-way up the private road leading into the community from the public highway. When closed, the gate made the remainder of the road accessible only to residents and others with an electronic pass card. The community also posted a sign on the gate reading \u0026ldquo;Private Property\u0026rdquo;. A few months after installing the gate, however, it had become the practice of residents to leave it open during the day and to close it only at night\u0026ndash;in part because non-residents visited frequently to enjoy the seaside views from one of the community\u0026rsquo;s many look-off points.\nThe protest at West Egg started the day after a local news story was published about an individual from Halifax who offered to purchase a house for sale in the community but was refused, without reason, by the seller. The story explained that the prospective purchaser, who is Black, offered well above the asking price and had learned through their own inquiries that there were no competing offers on the house. The prospective purchaser believed the seller\u0026rsquo;s refusal was motivated by anti-Black racism. West Egg\u0026rsquo;s current residents are predominantly white.\nAs soon as a small group of protesters gathered in the wake of the news story\u0026ndash;on the private road leading into West Egg\u0026ndash;to challenge the seller\u0026rsquo;s actions, the community\u0026rsquo;s gates were closed, barring them entry. As public attention to the incident grew, the reporter who wrote the original story discovered that the insolvent real estate developer who sold the land to West Egg\u0026rsquo;s co-op back in the 1970s had purchased it from the Catholic Church for a huge sum, planning to build a luxury seaside resort. Once these facts were uncovered, the original protestors were joined by activists demanding reparations addressing the historical and ongoing harms to Indigenous communities from residential schools and to the broader pursuit of land justice in Mi\u0026rsquo;kma\u0026rsquo;ki. Others used the stark image of West Egg as an elite gated community to underscore the crisis of affordable housing in the province and the inability for hundreds of unhoused people to meet their basic needs on a daily basis. Some of West Egg\u0026rsquo;s earliest and longest residents, worried about the direction their community had taken lately, also joined in.\nAfter a few days of these protests, the co-op\u0026rsquo;s Board demanded that the protestors move their activities to the nearby public highway, which would make it effectively impossible for the activists to sustain their action. When the protestors refused to move, the Board decided to pursue convictions for trespass under the Protection of Property Act.\nBased on your reading of Harrison v Carswell, do you think the protestors would be successful in defending against a claim in trespass under the Protection of Property Act? Give your reasons.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/admin/schedule/","title":"Course Schedule","section":"Admin","content":"This is the official course schedule.

Central to this context was the hunting and trading of wild animals. Much of the property law of the time was shaped in this context of encounter.\nTina Loo observes that Blackstone\u0026rsquo;s view that wild animals were common property, open to anyone for the taking, was embraced by early colonists in North America, particularly in the Thirteen Colonies. Hunting was framed as an expression of fundamental freedom by colonists and contrasted with Old World restrictions. Colonists in British North America were more permissive of wildlife regulations that curbed hunting access [@loo2006StatesNature, 13-14].\nThe Problem of Recognition # This week we start to explore a fundamental problem in the law of property: the problem of recognition. How do (and should) relationships to land get recognized in law? Which kinds of relations \u0026ldquo;count\u0026rdquo; and which do not? And what does this tell us about the question of who benefits?\nFrom an Anglo-Canadian legal perspective, significant attention is paid to acts of possession, as you saw from our discussion of Harrison v Carswell last week. It is by possessing something that a person gains recognition of certain legal entitlements\u0026ndash;a relationship that is at once physical (an act of control) and psychological (a matter of intention). But this is not the only possible kind of relationship that property law might recognize and prioritize. In fact, much of the history of common law property involves the colonial project of possession and control developed to mask or make invisible Indigenous legal relationships to land that reveal very different logics of recognition. Pay close attention to the language and assumptions about Indigenous peoples and Indigenous law in the materials this week and please note that some of this can be difficult to read.\nLiberalism and Legal Style # Last week, we drew an analogy between law and language, noting that the \u0026ldquo;vocabulary\u0026rdquo; of Anglo-Canadian legal arguments resembles a set of typical, highly patterned arguments used by jurists to debate and reason through a problem or dispute. Our discussion of this vocabulary left us with a nagging question: How can these back-and-forth legal arguments ever help us to actually resolve a problem, to decide which judgement or decision or outcome is more persuasive? If every legal argument has predictable counter-arguments, how does one side of the argument ever \u0026ldquo;win out\u0026rdquo; over the other?\nFrom a historical perspective, the answer to this question has often depended\u0026ndash;in part\u0026ndash;on when we are asking it. In other words, the question of persuasiveness is closely tied to the concept of legal styles that emerge from and evolve over particular historical periods of legal thought. For much of our course, we will draw this link by exploring two contrasting styles of Anglo-Canadian legal thought that are both rooted in its basic grammatical structure, which we will introduce this week as the basic structure of Western liberalism.\nOur Problem this Week # We return to our hypothetical setting of West Eggleston for this week\u0026rsquo;s problem, Wowkwis, to begin unpacking the problem of recognition and its connection to legal style. Remember, you can read the assigned material in any order you choose by following the links on each page, but note that all of the material assigned is mandatory and you should review all of it before our first class of the week.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/problems/wowkwis/","title":"Wowkwis","section":"Problems","content":"West Eggleston is back in the news after claims by a Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw hunter that one of its residents unlawfully interfered with a fox (wowkwis, in Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq) hunt in which the hunter was exercising their constitutionally-protected treaty rights. The population of wowkwis has been growing rapidly in the area in recent years, exceeding the carrying capacity of the landscape, disrupting the ecosystem balance among its prey and other predators, and causing more and more interactions with human settlements. As a consequence, the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw Chiefs issued a statement underlining the significant role Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw hunters play in establishing and sustaining healthy forest ecosystems.\nThe controversy came about after the hunter had pursued the wowkwis at length during a morning hunt across a large tract of inland forest that borders on several residential parcels in and around West Egg. The forest land is designated by the Province of Nova Scotia as Crown Land (i.e. land \u0026ldquo;vested in the Crown\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;under the administration and control of the Minister\u0026rdquo; of Lands and Forests pursuant to the Crown Lands Act, RSNS 1989, c 114, s 9).\nAfter several hours of pursuit to the edge of the forest, the hunter shot and wounded the wowkwis but was unable to capture it before it ran toward one of the neighbouring properties on which there was a small house and backyard surrounded by a picket fence. Upon hearing a noise outside, the occupant of the house emerged and spotted the wounded fox scratching at the gate. Being a long-time advocate for animal welfare who opposed all forms of hunting, the house\u0026rsquo;s occupant moved quickly to let the fox inside. As soon as the gate was opened, the wowkwis sprinted toward the house but with this final expenditure of effort died soon after.\nThe hunter requested that the fox pelt be returned to them but the house\u0026rsquo;s occupant refused. Despite this refusal, the hunter entered the gate, seized the pelt of the wowkwis and carried it away. In the aftermath of the dispute, it was discovered that the occupant was not in fact the owner of the land where the fox died. By some surveyor\u0026rsquo;s mistake many years ago, the land had been included in the original West Egg development without the co-operative ever having acquired title. That title remained with the Crown as part of the larger tract of neighbouring forest land.\nNeither the hunter nor the occupant of the land held a Provincial license to hunt fox at the time of the events. The West Egg co-operative\u0026rsquo;s by-laws stipulate that all members are required to make every effort to keep wild \u0026ldquo;nuisance\u0026rdquo; animals from coming into or otherwise disrupting quiet enjoyment of the community.\nOnce the controversy described above hit the news, it attracted the attention of provincial officials. Soon after, both the house\u0026rsquo;s occupant and the hunter received a letter from the Minister of Lands and Forests demanding that the wowkwis pelt be turned over to the Department.\nWho owns the pelt of the wowkwis?\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/admin/faq/","title":"FAQ","section":"Admin","content":"This page addresses \u0026ldquo;Frequently Asked Questions\u0026rdquo; about using the Land+Property casebook.\nDo I need to read the material online using my computer? # In order to successfully review and prepare the weekly assigned readings, you will need to access the casebook via a browser on your computer.

To the concept of title in Anglo-Canadian law in other contexts?\nStatement of Claim # 1 The Plaintiffs, Wolastoqey Nation at Matawaskiye (Madawaska Maliseet First Nation), Wolastoqey Nation at Neqotkuk (Tobique First Nation), Wolastoqey Nation at Pilick (Kingsclear First Nation), Wolastoqey Nation at Sitansisk (Saint Mary’s First Nation), Wolastoqey Nation at Welamukotuk (Oromocto First Nation) and Wolastoqey Nation at Wotstak (Woodstock First Nation), on behalf of all members of Wolastoqey Nation, claim:\n(a) a declaration that Wolastoqey Nation has Aboriginal title to the lands, including the land, airspace, land covered by water, offshore and inshore water bodies, foreshore, rivers, lakes and streams, described in Schedule “A”, or to such portions thereof for which this Court may find the evidence sufficient (“Traditional Lands”);\n(b) certificates of pending litigation for properties bearing the property identification numbers set out in Schedule “B”;\n(c) damages and compensation from the Crown Defendants (as defined hereinbelow) for the Crown Defendants’ breaches of the Crown’s fiduciary obligations, and for the unlawful occupation, appropriation, removal of resources from, and infringement of, the Plaintiffs’ Aboriginal title over their Traditional Lands, including infringements arising from the Defendants and others being in occupation of the Traditional Lands without permission from the Plaintiffs;\n(d) an Order of scire facias in respect of the properties bearing the property identification numbers set out in Schedule “B”;\n(e) in the alternative to (d), an Order of ejectment and recovery of land in respect of the properties bearing the property identification numbers set out in Schedule “B”;\n[\u0026hellip;]\n2 The Plaintiffs seek no relief as against fee simple holders not named as Defendants who hold fee simple in the Traditional Lands (“Strangers to the Claim”). The incidents of fee simple title enjoyed by Strangers to the Claim, including the incident of peaceable possession, are not placed in issue by the Plaintiffs. As outlined in paragraph 1(c), however, the Plaintiffs seek damages and compensation from the Province and Canada for the breach of Aboriginal title in the granting of fees simple in the Traditional Lands to Strangers to the Claim.\n3 The Plaintiffs do not seek a declaration of Aboriginal title in paragraph 1(a) that binds Strangers to the Claim with respect to such Strangers to the Claims’ property rights.\nParties # 4 The Plaintiffs, who represent Wolastoqey Nation, are Matawaskiye (Madawaska Maliseet), Neqotkuk (Tobique), Pilick (Kingsclear), Sitansisk (Saint Mary’s), Welamukotuk (Oromocto), and Wotstak (Woodstock) First Nations (collectively, the First Nations), being the six Wolastoqey First Nations in New Brunswick. They each have the capacity of an Indian Band within the meaning of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5, as amended.\n5 The Wolastoqey Nation, and the Plaintiff First Nations representing Wolastoqey Nation in this action, are Aboriginal peoples within the meaning of section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.\n6 The Attorney General of Canada (“Canada”) is joined pursuant to sections 3, 21(1) and 23(1) of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50, as amended.\n7 Canada has legislative jurisdiction in relation to “Indians and lands reserved for the Indians” pursuant to subsection 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867, subject to the rights and interests of the Plaintiffs.\n8 The Province of New Brunswick (“New Brunswick”) is joined pursuant to sections 3, 11, and 12 of the Proceedings Against the Crown Act, R.S.N.B. 1973, c, P-18, as amended.\n9 New Brunswick is vested with the administration, control and beneficial interest in provincial Crown lands pursuant to section 109 of the Constitution Act, 1867, subject to the rights and interests of the Plaintiffs.\n10 New Brunswick has legislative jurisdiction over lands in New Brunswick pursuant to subsections 92(5) and 92(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867, subject to the rights and interests of the Plaintiffs.\n11 Together, Canada and New Brunswick are referred to in these pleadings as the Crown Defendants.\n12 The Industrial Defendants are:\n(a) New Brunswick Power Corporation/Société d\u0026rsquo;énergie du Nouveau-Brunswick, a corporation incorporated in the Province of New Brunswick, with the registered office located at 515 King Street P.O.

Box 5777, Saint John, NB E2L 4M3; and\n(h) The following entities which are related to and/or subsidiaries of J.D. Irving, Limited [\u0026hellip;]\n13 The Industrial Defendants are industrial businesses and a Crown corporation that are in possession of the portions of the Traditional Lands as set out in Schedule “B”, on the basis of Crown grants.\n14 Pursuant to Rule 19.01, this statement of claim is being served on defendants located outside New Brunswick without leave, on the basis that the property in question is located in New Brunswick.\nPossession of Traditional Lands Prior to the Assertion of Crown Sovereignty # 15 The Plaintiffs are the First Nations residing in what is now New Brunswick that are part of the larger Wolastoqey Nation, which before the assertion of British sovereignty occupied vast tracts of territory, including territory in what are now New Brunswick, Québec and Maine.\n16 The territory occupied included the Traditional Lands, being what is now known as the Wolastoq, also known as the St. John River, watershed and surrounding area, including the land, subsurface land and minerals, airspace, land covered by water, offshore and inshore water bodies, foreshore, rivers, lakes and streams situated within this area. The Plaintiffs only seek remedies in this litigation with respect to their Traditional Lands within New Brunswick, and not with respect to their Traditional Lands found within the present boundaries of the Province of Québec and the State of Maine. A map of the Traditional Lands within New Brunswick is included in Schedule “A”.\n17 The First Nations and members of the Wolastoqey Nation are the direct descendants of the Wolastoqey Nation which was present on the Traditional Lands prior to the British assertion of sovereignty.\n18 Wolastoqey custom provided that members of each local group had use of its own local territory, including all of its lands, waters, and resources. However, Wolastoqey Nation as a whole had exclusive occupation of the entire Traditional Lands, and members of Wolastoqey Nation were able to travel and harvest freely throughout the Traditional Lands.\nPossession at the Time of the Assertion of British Sovereignty # 19 At the time of the British assertion of sovereignty in 1759, Wolastoqey Nation controlled, regularly used, exclusively occupied, and exercised exclusive stewardship and jurisdiction over their territory, including the Traditional Lands, in accordance with Wolastoqey law. Such law provided that a person from outside their territory was expected to seek permission to be present. Anyone seeking to pass through Wolastoqey Nation’s territory or to otherwise use the Traditional Lands would require such permission. It was customary that permission, if requested, would often be granted to other friendly Indigenous persons to travel through or to temporarily stay in the territory and to hunt, fish and gather to feed themselves while doing so.\n20 Permission was also granted to certain French groups to occupy certain lands within Wolastoqey Nation’s territory. The Wolastoqey Nation generally had a friendly and allied relationship with the French and their presence in Wolastoqey Nation’s Traditional Lands helped to facilitate alliance, trade, and related activities.\n21 Prior to and at the assertion of British sovereignty and continuing to present day, Wolastoqey Nation has used their Traditional Lands for a variety of purposes including hunting, fishing, gathering and other resource-harvesting activities, trade, and cultural and spiritual practices.\n22 At all relevant times, from the assertion of sovereignty in 1758-1759, to the Peace and Friendship Treaties between the British and Wolastoqey Nation from 1725 to 1778, the British Crown recognized Wolastoqey Nation as the Indigenous people who exclusively occupied their territory, including the Traditional Lands.\nThe Peace and Friendship Treaties # 23 From 1725/1726 to 1778, Wolastoqey Nation negotiated and entered into Treaties with the Crown, known as the Peace and Friendship Treaties. These Treaties do not provide for the surrender of lands to the Crown.\n24 In entering into the Peace and Friendship Treaties, Wolastoqey Nation did not cede or surrender their Aboriginal title to the Traditional Lands.\n25 Wolastoqey Nation’s title to the Traditional Lands has never been extinguished through surrender or legislation, and survives today.\n26 Wolastoqey Nation reserves the right to claim Aboriginal title and rights in respect of the whole or any portions of their territory outside the Traditional Lands depicted in Schedule “A” in the future.\nInfringement # 27 Canada and New Brunswick and their predecessors had and have a duty to respect and protect Wolastoqey Nation’s Aboriginal title.\n28 The Defendants have infringed upon or otherwise breached the Defendants’ constitutional duties in respect of Wolastoqey Nation’s Aboriginal title in the Traditional Lands by alienating lands and undertaking, authorizing and/or permitting resource extraction and land use activities throughout the Traditional Lands without the Wolastoqey Nation’s consent.\n29 Such uses and alienations of land were in breach of the Defendants’ duties to respect and protect Wolastoqey Nation’s Aboriginal title and have unjustifiably infringed Wolastoqey Nation’s Aboriginal title.\n30 In particular, the Crown Defendants breached their duties to respect and protect Wolastoqey Nation’s Aboriginal title by actions including, but not limited to:\n(a) issuing, replacing and renewing licences, leases, permits, authorizations, grants and other tenures to third parties or otherwise occupying, managing and allocating lands and resources in a manner which interferes with Wolastoqey Nation’s Aboriginal title;\n(b) conveying land to themselves and to third parties without regard to Wolastoqey Nation’s Aboriginal title;\n(c) passing laws which purport to enable or authorize Canada and New Brunswick to alienate lands and resources to third parties or to use those resources for their own benefit;\n(d) purporting to exercise management, ownership and control over lands and resources without regard to Wolastoqey Nation’s Aboriginal title;\n(e) committing or authorizing nuisances, trespass or other interferences which restrict or interfere with Wolastoqey Nation’s Aboriginal title;\n(f) deriving royalties and other benefits from the lands and resources and denying Wolastoqey Nation the right to receive benefits therefrom;\n(g) failing to protect and sustainably manage the lands and resources; and\n(h) failing to adequately consult and/or accommodate Wolastoqey Nation or otherwise discharge the Crown’s fiduciary duties and/or the honour of the Crown in respect of the above activities.\n31 Such infringements were not justified. These infringements were not made after the discharge of the Crown Defendants’ procedural duty to consult and accommodate; the Crown Defendants’ actions were not backed by a compelling and substantial objective; and the governmental actions were not consistent with the fiduciary obligations of the Crown Defendants.\n32 In particular, the Crown Defendants’ grants of the properties as set out in Schedule “B” were unjustified infringements of the Plaintiffs’ Aboriginal title and contrary to law. These grants must be quashed and an Order of scire facias must be issued in respect of each of the properties set out in Schedule “B”.\n33 In the alternative to paragraph 29, the defendants as set out in Schedule “B” are currently in possession of the properties set out next to their names in Schedule “B”. The Plaintiffs were wrongly dispossessed of their Aboriginal title lands. The Plaintiffs intend on regaining possession of these lands. As such, the Plaintiffs petition this Court for an Order of ejectment and for recovery of land.\n34 The Crown Defendants owe the Plaintiffs compensation for infringements on their Aboriginal title by parties other than the Crown Defendants, for the loss of use of their Traditional Lands, and for breach of fiduciary duty.\n35 In respect of the lands in the Traditional Lands that are not held by the Crown Defendants and which are not set out in Schedule “B”, the return of these lands is not sought by the Plaintiffs in this litigation, in spite of the unjustified infringements on them that have been authorized by the Crown Defendants. The compensation that the Crown Defendants owe the Plaintiffs in respect of these lands must concomitantly increase to account for the permanence of the Plaintiffs’ loss of use of these lands.\n36 Furthermore, the Crown Defendants themselves purport to have ownership of some of the Plaintiffs’ Traditional Lands. Upon a declaration of Aboriginal title:\n(a) all such lands immediately vest in interest in the Plaintiffs;\n(b) the Plaintiffs are entitled to vesting in possession of all Crown lands within the parts of Schedule “A” which are declared to be Aboriginal title lands, but in the interest of furthering reconciliation with non-Indigenous people, the Plaintiffs only seek an order vesting them with possession of the Crown lands as set out in Schedule “C”;\n(c) with respect to Crown lands not in Schedule “C” and which are not the subject of a lease, whether these lands are to be returned shall depend on the Crown’s ability to justify its infringements;\n(d) with respect to Crown lands subject to a leasehold interest, the vesting of the reversion and any remainder in the Plaintiffs;\n(e) compensation for infringement of Aboriginal title is due from each respective Crown Defendant, to be reduced where appropriate to account for lands that are returned to the possession of the Plaintiffs.\n37 In addition, to the extent that resources, such as minerals and timber, have been removed from the Traditional Lands by the Defendants or by persons not involved in this litigation, where such removal was done with the permission of the Crown Defendants, the Crown Defendants owe the Plaintiffs compensation for the value of these resources.\n38 In addition, to the extent that lands and resources within and on the Traditional Lands have been lost or damaged by Defendants or by persons not involved in this litigation, where such loss or damage was done with the permission of the Crown Defendants, the Crown Defendants owe the Plaintiffs compensation for the value of these resources and for the damage to the lands.\n39 The amount of compensation that the Crown Defendants owe the Plaintiffs will be further particularized by the evidence to be adduced at trial.\n40 Moreover, any statutes enacted by the Crown Defendants that meaningfully diminish the right of the Plaintiffs to exclusively occupy the Traditional Lands is constitutionally invalid, or constitutionally inapplicable to the Traditional Lands.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/lessons/week03/","title":"Title as Recognition","section":"Lessons","content":" The Legal Imprimatur of Title # So far in our course we have discussed the central role of possession in Anglo-Canadian law and its complex connections to ownership and title going back to early liberal theory.

Year after year, the success of these remarkable tomato plants is sustained through careful collection, storage, and planting of the seeds from the prior year\u0026rsquo;s crop\u0026ndash;ensuring that each tomato is a true (and delicious) reflection of its particular lineage.\nRecently one of the several farm properties neighbouring West Egg was purchased by a new farmer, who decided to introduce large-scale greenhouse tomato production. Based on their business plan to develop a new and unique product which they plan to sell directly to consumers at the Brewery Market and other outlets around the province, the new farmer decided to license the only available genetically-modified (GMO) tomato currently available on the market from US-based company called Norfolk Plant Sciences\u0026ndash;a tomato with rich purple fruit that is especially high in antioxidants. Under the terms of the license, the farmer pays a substantial annual fee to Norkfolk\u0026ndash;who retains patent rights in the tomato\u0026rsquo;s genetics\u0026ndash;to use Norfolk\u0026rsquo;s seed. The license specifically prohibits the licensee from saving and replanting seeds the following season or otherwise reproducing the tomato plants in any way.\nThroughout the following growing season, the West Egg resident growing heritage tomatoes began to notice that their fruits were not ripening to the normal shade of bright yellow but instead were developing a novel striated pattern of yellow and purple. The grower immediately suspected that their plants had been pollinated\u0026ndash;probably by local bees\u0026ndash;from those growing in the greenhouse containing GMO tomatoes.\nAfter complaining to the neighbouring farmer that \u0026ldquo;genetic drift\u0026rdquo; from their GMO tomatoes was contaminating the heritage plot, the West Egg resident carried out their own research and discovered that it would be possible\u0026ndash;though expensive\u0026ndash;for the farmer to install a new, prototype filtration system in the greenhouse\u0026rsquo;s air exchange system that would prevent cross-pollination with other plants in the vicinity. Despite repeated pleas for the farmer of the GMO tomatoes to adopt this new technology, they have so far refused to do so.\nThe heritage tomato grower from West Egg ultimately decided to bring a claim in nuisance against the GMO farmer, asking for an injunction to restrain the defendant from operating a tomato greenhouse facility using GMO tomatoes on their land.\nThe main cases you will read this week (Victoria Park, Canadian Copper, and Canadian Paper) are each good examples of the classical style.

Then explain briefly how you have relied on the assumptions implicit in the classical style to arrive at a decision.\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/lessons/week04/","title":"Nuisance and the Right to Exclude","section":"Lessons","content":" Property and Exclusion # Over the past few weeks we have been focused on how classical legal thought addressed questions of possession and title. We now turn to a second prominent topic\u0026ndash;one that mainly addresses the content of property rights held by owners or those in possession.\nOne right in particular, some argue, is fundamental to private property: the right to exclude others from interfering with the owner\u0026rsquo;s use and enjoyment of their land, other tangible things and even intangibles like knowledge goods. The common law has devised several remedies to enforce owners\u0026rsquo; right to exclude. We have already seen one example: in Harrison v Carswell, the mall owner brought an action in trespass against the picketer Sophie Carswell to exclude her from the mall sidewalk.\nThis week, we will look at a different type of tort action that engages one\u0026rsquo;s right to exclude, but also—reciprocally—others\u0026rsquo; rights to use their property as they wish: an action in nuisance. Our focus here will be somewhat narrower that you might have encountered in your torts class. We will explore nuisance law as a \u0026ldquo;property tort\u0026rdquo; for what it can tell us about how judges in the mode of classical legal thought address the clash of private property rights between neighbours and to what extent courts have been willing to enforce an owner\u0026rsquo;s right to exclude.\nMuch of our focus here is on one aspect of nuisance doctrine: the question of remedy. Once a nuisance has been established on the facts, should courts grant an injunction to prevent the nuisance-causing activity or should courts award damages to compensate the plaintiff for their losses? The former option most effectively enforces the owner\u0026rsquo;s right to exclude, while the latter forces the owner to accept payment for an ongoing \u0026ldquo;violation\u0026rdquo; of that right.\nNuisance Law in an Industrializing Canada # Widespread industrialization came somewhat late in Canada compared to England and the United States, where nuisance law was earlier addressed in the common law courts as a potential impediment to economic \u0026ldquo;progress\u0026rdquo;. As Jennifer Nedelsky explains:1\nBy the late nineteenth century, industrialization and urbanization were changing the shape of Canadian society: between 1880 and 1920 the population doubled from 3,689,257 to 8,788,483; 74.35 per cent of the population were classified as rural by the census of Canada in 1881; by 1921 the percentage had decreased to 50.48. Capital investment in manufactures increased from $165,302,632 in 1880 to $2,923,667,011 in 1920 and the gross value of all manufactured products from $469,847,886 in 1880 to $3,706,544,997 in 1920. Manufacturing, once diffused, was concentrating in industrial towns. Factories increasingly replaced small workshops, and steam-powered engines brought noise as well as productivity. As the nuisances of industrialization increased, so did the costs of eliminating them. Manufacturing establishments, for example, were becoming sufficiently large and important to local economies that ordering them to take their nuisances elsewhere would have had serious consequences.\nLike their English and American counterparts before them, common law courts in Canada struggled to adjudicate nuisance claims in this evolving context, which often pitted the demands of business and the growing influence of industry against the traditional property rights of neighbouring landowners. However, because industrialization came relatively late to Canada, Canadian courts confronted nuisance cases against the background of legal principles already developed elsewhere. A key question became to what extent Canadian courts would follow these established precedents-—primarily from England-—or chart their own path.\nTraditionally, the common law afforded heavy priority to the absolute protection of private owners rights to use and enjoy their property, enforced by way of an injunction against the offending activities of neighbouring landowners. In the Shelfer case you will read this week, the Court opened the door for greater flexibility on the part of courts to substitute an award of damages in place of a permanent injunction in appropriate circumstances. Legal historians have largely interpreted this move as an attempt by the Court to take a more accommodating position toward industrial interests.\nOur Problem this Week # While taking the form of a hypothetical fact pattern as we\u0026rsquo;ve seen in some past weeks, our problem this week asks you to approach it as a jurist tasked with writing a legal decision that will persuasively resolve the dispute.\nNedelsky, Jennifer. “Judicial Conservatism in an Age of Innovation: Comparative Perspectives on Canadian Nuisance Law.” In Essays in the History of Canadian Law, edited by David H Flaherty, 281-322.

Nuisance, in other words, is one means to exclude others from doing something that limits owners\u0026rsquo; freedom related to property. This means of exclusion, however, unavoidably limits the freedom of others to use their land as they choose. In these cases, the courts must decide whose rights should win out and in doing so address the fundamental dilemma of conflicting freedoms inherent in legal liberalism.\nIn other cases—like the one we will study this week—it is not (or not only) a neighbouring landowner who is accused of infringing the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s property rights, but the state itself. This type of claim engages the state\u0026rsquo;s powers of expropriation (power to take away property rights)—in some contexts, called the power of eminent domain.\nIn the most dramatic cases, the state exercises its powers of expropriation to take private title to land (for example, to build a highway or an airport). But there are many other cases in which the state leaves title in the hands of the landowner and \u0026ldquo;takes\u0026rdquo; one or more sticks in the ownership bundle by way of regulation or other legislative act. In their broadest sense, such \u0026ldquo;regulatory takings\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;constructive takings\u0026rdquo; (as they are now called) are ubiquitous, ranging from environmental regulations to building codes and zoning bylaws. Similar to claims in nuisance, these state actions have sometimes been cast as violations of claimant landowners\u0026rsquo; traditional rights of property.\nA key legal issue is to what extent landowners in Canada can exclude governments from expropriating or otherwise regulating their property rights in the absence of compensation. Unlike the United States and several modern constitutional democracies, Canada lacks any constitutional protections for private property against state attempts to limit or take away those rights. Lacking such explicit protections, it has generally not been possible for claimants to invoke existing constitutional rights in ways that protect private property.\nWhat protections do exist mainly take the form of provincial expropriation statutes. These statutes do not prevent government from expropriating property altogether, but they do impose certain restrictions on this activity, such as that it must be undertaken for a public purpose and that adequate compensation to landowners must be paid. Such compensation is clearly required when title is taken away by the state. Much less clear is to what extent governments in Canada are responsible for compensating landowners for regulatory activity that \u0026ldquo;takes\u0026rdquo; one or more sticks in the bundle. As the United States Supreme Court observed in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v Mahon, \u0026ldquo;[g]overnment hardly could go on if, to some extent, values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law.\u0026rdquo;\nA crucial moment in the history of Anglo-Canadian legal thinking on issues of expropriation occured in the context of a dispute over water rights in Ontario at the end of the nineteenth century between the lumbering operations of one Peter McLaren and one Boyd Caldwell. We will study this controversy and its implications in depth this week.\nOur Problem this Week # We will start by returning to the aftermath of our problem about public protests from Week 1, in this week\u0026rsquo;s problem entitled After the West Egg Protest.\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/problems/protest-after/","title":"After the West Egg Protest","section":"Problems","content":"After the events of the protest at West Eggleston, some MLAs and their allies began to pressure the provincial government to expand access to places where members of the public can engage in peaceful protest and other forms of collective association. As a result of these efforts, the legislature passed an amendment to the Public Highways Act, RSNS 1989, c 371 which reads:\n5A Where members of the public are exercising their freedom of collective association on roads, lanes, paths or highways, the provisions of the Protection of Property Act, RSNS 1989, c 363 are of no force or effect.\nSection 2 of the Public Highways Act currently defines a \u0026ldquo;highway\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;a public highway or public road\u0026rdquo;.\nAfter the above amendment was enacted, West Egg co-operative\u0026rsquo;s board began to worry about the Act\u0026rsquo;s implications for its residents\u0026rsquo; quiet enjoyment of their land. Not having any further resources in its annual budget to hire a lawyer to advise them on this issue, some of the board\u0026rsquo;s members did their own research and discovered what seemed to be important provisions in Nova Scotia\u0026rsquo;s Expropriation Act, RSNS 1989, c 156.\nDid the Province of Nova Scotia expropriate the co-operative\u0026rsquo;s land by amending the Public Highway Act, and if so what can the co-op board do about it?\nAnswer Framework # Consider the following framework as you develop your answer to this week\u0026rsquo;s problem.\nIssue 1 - Defining Expropriation: What does it mean for the state to \u0026ldquo;expropriate\u0026rdquo; land?\nStart with the basic definition in Nova Scotia\u0026rsquo;s Expropriation Act. This statute tells us something (but not everything) about how expropriation is defined. What is missing from this definition?\nHow do the parties, courts and legislatures in the McLaren v Caldwell saga frame and understand the facts in that case as raising the issue of expropriation? How could this frame be applied to understand our weekly problem?\nIssue 2 - Statutory Interpretation: Making sense of section 5A of the Public Highway Act\nThe question here is whether or not the amendment to the Act actually applies to the roads in West Egg.\nThat question is similar to the one asked about the legislation in McLaren v Caldwell. What principle of statutory interpretation does the Supreme Court of Canada provide in this case that might help to answer our problem?\nIssue 3 - Compensation for Expropriation: Applying the Expropriation Act\nIf there is an argument to be made that section 5A of the Public Highway Act should be interpreted as applying to the roads in West Egg (Issue 2), what claim might the co-op board make under the provincial Expropriation Act?\nBased on what you know from the wording of the Expropriation Act and from the House of Commons debate in the McLaren saga, do you think such a claim would be successful and why? What more would you need to know in order to answer this question?\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/casebook/other/","title":"Chapter 6","section":"The Normal Casebook","content":"Other material not published.\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/lessons/week07/","title":"Alienation, Exit and Control","section":"Lessons","content":"Having now studied some of the historical basis for problems of recognition and exclusion, this week we move on to examine the context of exit: how owners transfer their rights in land and thereby disentangle themselves (wholly or partially) from property relations.\nCentral to this context are persistent tensions between an owner\u0026rsquo;s right to alienate property and their power to place restrictions on future owners\u0026rsquo; rights to do the same. As we will see, courts often put a heavy emphasis on the free alienability of land. Any attempts to restrict free alienability are viewed with considerable skepticism in the classical style—consistent with the liberal ideal that property rights should support individuals to pursue their own ends. We will read cases in which the courts scrutinize clauses in a will that purport to limit how or when beneficiaries under that will can transfer the property interests they receive. We will also examine the context of restrictive covenants in land.\nIn order to understand the controversies around alienability we study this week, we will first need some further background on the doctrine of estates in land and on the enforcement of restrictive covenants that \u0026ldquo;run with the land\u0026rdquo;. These are reasonably complex topics that we will return to again next term, but we will start with the basic elements of common law estates, practice identifying key interests and look at the early rules that determine when a restrictive covenant will be enforced against downstream owners. These topics will provide the foundation for understanding issues surrounding alienability in the cases.\nOur Problem this Week # For our problem this week, we pick up once again on some of the simmering tensions among landowners in West Egg and explore some of the strategies they attempt to use to exert control over the transfer of their property rights: Restraining Alienation.\n"},{"id":19,"href":"/problems/review01/","title":"Mid-Term Rapid Review","section":"Problems","content":" Week 1: Intro to the Course # A mid-twentieth century dispute at a shopping mall seems like an unusual place to start our course.

Rising housing price across the province have increased demand for land in West Egg dramatically. With its idyllic setting along the coast, several of the co-operative\u0026rsquo;s founding members worried that their community had lost sight of its roots in affordable housing and would eventually become nothing more than another tony suburb for wealthy. As we saw in our earlier problem, these dynamics had already begun to fracture the community and raised mounting concerns about exclusion and discrimination.\nThose conflicts are also playing out in quieter ways in the more obscure worlds of estate planning and restrictive covenants\u0026ndash;two different legal tools that can be used, in some instances, to control the transfer of interests in land.\nOne of West Egg\u0026rsquo;s oldest landowners has been among the most vocal about recent changes in the community and is worried that their modest house, affectionately known as \u0026ldquo;the Cottage\u0026rdquo;, on a beautiful waterfront lot next door to some community parkland owned by the West Egg co-op, might some day neighbour one of those gaudy new mansions that have been popping up more and more frequently. After consulting informally with several of their lawyer friends, the landowner convinces West Egg\u0026rsquo;s co-op board to enter into an agreement in which the board promises never to construct any structure on the community parkland larger than 1,000 square feet and, if the board ever chooses to sell the parkland, to offer it for sale first to existing residents of West Egg. At the time the agreement was made, the owner of the Cottage made it clear to the board that they intended it to be binding on future owners. Within a few years of the agreement, however, the membership of the co-op board had changed almost entirely and the parkland was sold directly to a developer who plans to build a mansion exactly as the owner of the Cottage feared. The developer claims to have had no knowledge of the agreement described above when they purchased the land.\nOn the other side of town, one of West Egg\u0026rsquo;s newest landowners is thrilled with their recent luck at having been able to sell their old house in Halifax for top dollar and purchase a substantially larger one in West Egg on a big lot with tons of room for their kid to run and play. At the same time, they have started to worry about how to ensure that their good fortune is shared among the rest of their family and passed on to the next generation. This new landowner sits down to draft the following clause, which they intend to include in their Last Will and Testament:\nWhen I die, my land in West Egg should go to my younger sister, who I want to be the land\u0026rsquo;s full and rightful owner. After that, the land should go to my daughter.\nCan the developer carry out their plans to build a new mansion in West Egg?

The targeting of Japanese Canadians living in British Columbia as \u0026ldquo;enemy aliens\u0026rdquo; remains one of the least-discussed examples of state-executed systematic racism in Canada\u0026rsquo;s history. In exploring this history, we will also begin to encounter the mid-century transition toward a new grammar of Anglo-Canadian legal thought: the modern style. As we will see, this period of Canadian history also has something important to tell us about the connection between property, ownership and citizenship.\nOur Problem this Week # Our problem this week takes up the legal context and the experience of Japanese Canadians during WWII directly, beginning with an unlikely correspondence between a home-owner in Victoria and William Lyon MacKenzie King: A Letter to the Prime Minister.\n"},{"id":22,"href":"/problems/takahashi-letter/","title":"A Letter to the Prime Minister","section":"Problems","content":"In 1944, Toyo Takahashi, a Japanese Canadian woman, wrote the following letter to Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, protesting the forced sale of her home in Victoria, British Columbia under the wartime legal regime that had emerged to dispossess Japanese Canadians of their property and \u0026ldquo;liquidate\u0026rdquo; their belongings:1\nDear Sir:\nThe Director of the Office of the Custodian in Vancouver has notified us of your policy of liquidation of Japanese property. Because of this policy my property has now been catalogued for sale. This liquidation is against your promises, and my wishes, furthermore it is utterly undeserved.\nPlease remind yourselves that before our oppression became politically fashionable, abetted by your evacuation policy and your seemingly tacit approval of all the undemocratic propaganda directed against us who are not your enemies, that the Japanese minority had the best reputation for morals and for vivid spirit of any minority in British Columbia. According to the Canadian Institute of Public Opinion, this reputation is still intact in spite of all the loud abuse levelled against it.\nThe contribution which my husband and I have made to this reputation is more than ordinary. My property at 42 Gorge Road, Victoria B.C. is tangible evidence of this contribution. My husband has invested heavily in our home and garden. During a period of ten years we have succeeded in collecting many valueable [sic] and rare plants, shrubs and trees. \u0026hellip; They are probably the only non-commercial gardenia trees in Victoria. On one occasion the Parks Superintendent of Victoria approached my husband and obtained for grafting some buds of a rare variety of cherry blossom. \u0026hellip;\nOur unique collection was well known and was widely appreciated by fellow hobbyists. Testimony of this appreciation is shown in the way people would stop to compliment us as they strolled by, many requested permission to walk through our garden, motorists local and tourist would slow down or even stop, and driver of sightseeing busses used to point out our home and garden as they drove by. When the evacuation became a stark reality my husband received many offers from nurseries to buy our collection but he declined.\nDidn’t you promise to keep intact all properties until we returned? Isn’t the garden an asset to Victoria just as much as it is a pride and joy to us? As for proof, during a survey conducted by the Victoria Horticultural Society, Mr Takahashi was granted an award of Merit, dated August 16, 1935. Two years later during the Royal Visit, their Majesties the King and Queen drove past our home. We treasure the memory of seeing Her Majesty turn her head to see our garden.\nNot only did our home and garden help to establish Victoria as “The Garden City of Canada” it also helped to cheer the sick and crippled. … By selling chrysanthemums which we had grown we raised money for the St. Joseph’s Hospital. In 1938, 1939, 1940, and 1941, we did the same … [for] the Junior Auxiliary of the Queen Alexandra Solarium for Crippled Children.\nAs citizens of Victoria we have participated in such civic affairs as May 24 celebrations and Christmas home lighting contests. These affairs were part of Victoria’s constantly extensive and intensive campaign to attract tourists. …\nAn undeserved liquidation of my property \u0026hellip; will not only jeopardise our present status but far worse our future welfare as well. This property is our home, the reward for long years of toil and anticipation, a source of recreation, a stake in the future of Victoria, and an insurance for our later welfare. …\nAfter all our efforts in good citizenship we do not deserve to have our retirement jeopardised by the liquidation of our properties.\nYours very truly,\nToyo Takahashi\n(1) How might the federal government\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;promises\u0026rdquo;, described by Toyo Takahashi, be interpreted as giving rise to a legal trust, in which the Director of the Office of the Custodian acts as the trustee of Takahashi\u0026rsquo;s property?

Our primary focus this week will pick up on our discussion of constructive expropriation from the McLaren v Caldwell. Recall that these cases involve claimed \u0026ldquo;takings\u0026rdquo; of property rights (or \u0026ldquo;sticks\u0026rdquo; from the ownership bundle) by the state, for which the owner would like to receive some form of compensation.\nThe line of cases we will read this week develop a more robust common law framework and legal test for resolving these claims about constructive takings. However, this area of the law remains heavily contested.\nIn addition to issues of constructive expropriation, we will also explore the related issue of \u0026ldquo;acquired rights\u0026rdquo; (sometimes called \u0026ldquo;legal non-conforming uses\u0026rdquo;). Such rights arise in the hands of landowners engaged in certain land uses when a zoning or other land-use bylaw changes. Provincial statutes, combined with common law doctrine, generally permit owners to continue pre-existing uses even when those are prohibited by the new bylaw. But because such uses can themselves change and evolve over time, this area of the law raises difficult questions about how far the protections afforded by acquired rights can extend.\nOur Problem this Week # Our problem this week combines issues of constructive takings and acquired rights set against government responses to the rising threat of floodwater damage in Manitoba: Flood on the Red River.\n"},{"id":25,"href":"/problems/flood/","title":"Flood on the Red River","section":"Problems","content":"The following hypothetical builds on a recent case before the Manitoba Court of Appeal,1 which reports these facts:\nA Maze in Corn Inc. operates a corn maze, petting zoo and haunted forest attraction (the business) on a property located on St. Mary\u0026rsquo;s Road, south of Winnipeg near St. Adolphe (the property). The property is located south of the gates of the Red River Floodway (the floodway).\nThe Red River runs through the City of Winnipeg, which is located on the Red River flood plain. In years of unusually high water, the river overflows its banks and causes widespread flooding and sewer back-ups in Winnipeg, resulting in significant property damage and economic loss.\nThe floodway, which was built in 1962 and 1968 and expanded in 1997, is a structure that includes a large ditch (the floodway channel) to divert water around Winnipeg. The flow of water is controlled by a floodway control structure (the gates) on the south side of Winnipeg that diverts water from the Red River into the floodway channel. When the gates are activated, the flow of water through the city is reduced and flooding in Winnipeg is either prevented or reduced. Unfortunately, the operation of the floodway causes water to back up to the south (i.e., upstream) of the gates, flooding properties to the south.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn 2019, the fall conditions in the Red River basin were much wetter than normal. The Manitoba Department of Water Stewardship (the Department) had determined that precipitation conditions posed a risk of unusually high water levels, which could potentially cause sewer back-up damage to homes in Winnipeg. It concluded that the artificial flooding to rural properties upstream (to the south) from the gates would be financially less costly than the projected sewer back-up damage within Winnipeg. In anticipation that this flooding would occur, the Department was in communication with A Maze in Corn about potential flood impacts.\nThe floodway gates were operated from October 9 to November 7, 2019, resulting in the anticipated severe unnatural flooding for miles upstream, including the property. The flooding was immediate and severe, completely flooding the \u0026ldquo;Haunted House\u0026rdquo; feature of the business within hours.\nSuppose that, in addition to the facts described above, the Department is empowered under provincial regulations pursuant to The Red River Floodway Act, CCSM, c R32, to operate the floodway when \u0026ldquo;the expected benefits of doing so clearly and substantially outweigh the expected costs\u0026rdquo;. However, because the flooding in this particular year was so extreme, operation of the floodway did nothing to actually reduce downstream flooding as anticipated and resulted in widespread damage to many homes and businesses within the City of Winnipeg.\nMeanwhile, although the A Maze in Corn Inc. was initially resigned to closing their business when the floods hit, members of the public using the river for recreation soon discovered that they could access and maneuver through the half-submerged corn maze by boat. A few posts on social media turned this into a major local attraction. By the end of November, the flood waters had receded and the business could again operate the corn maze and petting zoo in their normal fashion.\nAfter the flood, in April of the following year, the regional municipality encompassing St. Adolphe decided that it needed to take further steps to prevent flood losses among its residents in the future. It enacted a new municipal plan and zoning bylaw that required all land within 100 metres of the banks of the Red River to \u0026ldquo;remain unused in its natural state\u0026rdquo; and removed all pre-existing uses, which included both agricultural and commercial uses. The following season, after the bylaw was passed, A Maze in Corn Inc. decided that it would restructure its business, relocating an existing barn and other infrastructure to about 50 metres from the riverbank and starting a medium-sized, pasture-raised pork farm\u0026ndash;about which a few of the neighbours complained due to some modest new smells in mid-summer.\nWould A Maze in Corn Inc. likely be successful in making a claim for compensation against either the province or the municipality? Whether or not it was successful in doing so, would the business be prohibited by the new municipal bylaw from operating its hog farm?\nFor the purposes of this hypothetical, you can assume that Manitoba\u0026rsquo;s legislation governing expropriation is the same as Nova Scotia\u0026rsquo;s Expropriation Act\nA Maze in Corn Inc v.

IP topics are often framed, implicitly or explicitly, as rights that are \u0026ldquo;created\u0026rdquo; because they are entirely artificial (i.e. flowing from the nature of information and the need to incentivize creators through exclusionary IP rights). But there exist a start contrast in this treatment of IP with the treatment of property in land taken as \u0026ldquo;given\u0026rdquo; or naturalized in particular ways that ignores the reality that property in land is also created and that those processes of creation are situated directly in the context of landed colonialism. How to Use this Casebook # "},{"id":27,"href":"/casebook/relationships/locke/","title":"Locke's Second Treatise on Government\n","section":"Chapter 1","content":"Whether we consider natural reason, which tells us, that men, being once born, have a right to their preservation, and consequently to meat and drink, and such other things as nature affords for their subsistence: or revelation, which gives us an account of those grants God made of the world to Adam, and to Noah, and his sons, it is very clear, that God, as king David says, Psal. cxv. 16. has given the earth to the children of men; given it to mankind in common. But this being supposed, it seems to some a very great difficulty, how any one should ever come to have a property in any thing: I will not content myself to answer, that if it be difficult to make out property, upon a supposition that God gave the world to Adam, and his posterity in common, it is impossible that any man, but one universal monarch, should have any property upon a supposition, that God gave the world to Adam, and his heirs in succession, exclusive of all the rest of his posterity. But I shall endeavour to shew, how men might come to have a property in several parts of that which God gave to mankind in common, and that without any express compact of all the commoners.\nGod, who hath given the world to men in common, hath also given them reason to make use of it to the best advantage of life, and convenience. The earth, and all that is therein, is given to men for the support and comfort of their being. And tho\u0026rsquo; all the fruits it naturally produces, and beasts it feeds, belong to mankind in common, as they are produced by the spontaneous hand of nature; and no body has originally a private dominion, exclusive of the rest of mankind, in any of them, as they are thus in their natural state: yet being given for the use of men, there must of necessity be a means to appropriate them some way or other, before they can be of any use, or at all beneficial to any particular man. The fruit, or venison, which nourishes the wild Indian, who knows no enclosure, and is still a tenant in common, must be his, and so his, i.e. a part of him, that another can no longer have any right to it, before it can do him any good for the support of his life.\nThough the earth, and all inferior creatures, be common to all men, yet every man has a property in his own person: this no body has any right to but himself. The labour of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property. It being by him removed from the common state nature hath placed it in, it hath by this labour something annexed to it, that excludes the common right of other men: for this labour being the unquestionable property of the labourer, no man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to, at least where there is enough, and as good, left in common for others.\nHe that is nourished by the acorns he picked up under an oak, or the apples he gathered from the trees in the wood, has certainly appropriated them to himself. No body can deny but the nourishment is his. I ask then, when did they begin to be his? when he digested? or when he eat? or when he boiled? or when he brought them home? or when he picked them up? and it is plain, if the first gathering made them not his, nothing else could. That labour put a distinction between them and common: that added something to them more than nature, the common mother of all, had done; and so they became his private right. And will any one say, he had no right to those acorns or apples, he thus appropriated, because he had not the consent of all mankind to make them his? Was it a robbery thus to assume to himself what belonged to all in common? If such a consent as that was necessary, man had starved, notwithstanding the plenty God had given him. We see in commons, which remain so by compact, that it is the taking any part of what is common, and removing it out of the state nature leaves it in, which begins the property; without which the common is of no use. And the taking of this or that part, does not depend on the express consent of all the commoners. Thus the grass my horse has bit; the turfs my servant has cut; and the ore I have digged in any place, where I have a right to them in common with others, become my property, without the assignation or consent of any body. The labour that was mine, removing them out of that common state they were in, hath fixed my property in them.\nBy making an explicit consent of every commoner, necessary to any one\u0026rsquo;s appropriating to himself any part of what is given in common, children or servants could not cut the meat, which their father or master had provided for them in common, without assigning to every one his peculiar part. Though the water running in the fountain be every one\u0026rsquo;s, yet who can doubt, but that in the pitcher is his only who drew it out? His labour hath taken it out of the hands of nature, where it was common, and belonged equally to all her children, and hath thereby appropriated it to himself.\nThus this law of reason makes the deer that Indian\u0026rsquo;s who hath killed it; it is allowed to be his goods, who hath bestowed his labour upon it, though before it was the common right of every one. And amongst those who are counted the civilized part of mankind, who have made and multiplied positive laws to determine property, this original law of nature, for the beginning of property, in what was before common, still takes place; and by virtue thereof, what fish any one catches in the ocean, that great and still remaining common of mankind; or what ambergrise any one takes up here, is by the labour that removes it out of that common state nature left it in, made his property, who takes that pains about it. And even amongst us, the hare that any one is hunting, is thought his who pursues her during the chase: for being a beast that is still looked upon as common, and no man\u0026rsquo;s private possession; whoever has employed so much labour about any of that kind, as to find and pursue her, has thereby removed her from the state of nature, wherein she was common, and hath begun a property.\nIt will perhaps be objected to this, that if gathering the acorns, or other fruits of the earth, \u0026amp;c. makes a right to them, then any one may ingross as much as he will. To which I answer, Not so. The same law of nature, that does by this means give us property, does also bound that property too. God has given us all things richly, 1 Tim. vi. 12. is the voice of reason confirmed by inspiration. But how far has he given it us to enjoy? As much as any one can make use of to any advantage of life before it spoils, so much he may by his labour fix a property in: whatever is beyond this, is more than his share, and belongs to others. Nothing was made by God for man to spoil or destroy. And thus, considering the plenty of natural provisions there was a long time in the world, and the few spenders; and to how small a part of that provision the industry of one man could extend itself, and ingross it to the prejudice of others; especially keeping within the bounds, set by reason, of what might serve for his use; there could be then little room for quarrels or contentions about property so established.\nBut the chief matter of property being now not the fruits of the earth, and the beasts that subsist on it, but the earth itself; as that which takes in and carries with it all the rest; I think it is plain, that property in that too is acquired as the former. As much land as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the product of, so much is his property. He by his labour does, as it were, inclose it from the common. Nor will it invalidate his right, to say every body else has an equal title to it; and therefore he cannot appropriate, he cannot inclose, without the consent of all his fellow-commoners, all mankind. God, when he gave the world in common to all mankind, commanded man also to labour, and the penury of his condition required it of him. God and his reason commanded him to subdue the earth, i.e. improve it for the benefit of life, and therein lay out something upon it that was his own, his labour. He that in obedience to this command of God, subdued, tilled and sowed any part of it, thereby annexed to it something that was his property, which another had no title to, nor could without injury take from him.\nNor was this appropriation of any parcel of land, by improving it, any prejudice to any other man, since there was still enough, and as good left; and more than the yet unprovided could use. So that, in effect, there was never the less left for others because of his enclosure for himself: for he that leaves as much as another can make use of, does as good as take nothing at all. No body could think himself injured by the drinking of another man, though he took a good draught, who had a whole river of the same water left him to quench his thirst: and the case of land and water, where there is enough of both, is perfectly the same.\nGod gave the world to men in common; but since he gave it them for their benefit, and the greatest conveniencies of life they were capable to draw from it, it cannot be supposed he meant it should always remain common and uncultivated. He gave it to the use of the industrious and rational, (and labour was to be his title to it;) not to the fancy or covetousness of the quarrelsome and contentious. He that had as good left for his improvement, as was already taken up, needed not complain, ought not to meddle with what was already improved by another\u0026rsquo;s labour: if he did, it is plain he desired the benefit of another\u0026rsquo;s pains, which he had no right to, and not the ground which God had given him in common with others to labour on, and whereof there was as good left, as that already possessed, and more than he knew what to do with, or his industry could reach to.\nIt is true, in land that is common in England, or any other country, where there is plenty of people under government, who have money and commerce, no one can inclose or appropriate any part, without the consent of all his fellow-commoners; because this is left common by compact, i.e. by the law of the land, which is not to be violated. And though it be common, in respect of some men, it is not so to all mankind; but is the joint property of this country, or this parish. Besides, the remainder, after such enclosure, would not be as good to the rest of the commoners, as the whole was when they could all make use of the whole; whereas in the beginning and first peopling of the great common of the world, it was quite otherwise. The law man was under, was rather for appropriating. God commanded, and his wants forced him to labour. That was his property which could not be taken from him where-ever he had fixed it. And hence subduing or cultivating the earth, and having dominion, we see are joined together. The one gave title to the other. So that God, by commanding to subdue, gave authority so far to appropriate: and the condition of human life, which requires labour and materials to work on, necessarily introduces private possessions.\nThe measure of property nature has well set by the extent of men\u0026rsquo;s labour and the conveniences of life: no man\u0026rsquo;s labour could subdue, or appropriate all; nor could his enjoyment consume more than a small part; so that it was impossible for any man, this way, to intrench upon the right of another, or acquire to himself a property, to the prejudice of his neighbour, who would still have room for as good, and as large a possession (after the other had taken out his) as before it was appropriated. This measure did confine every man\u0026rsquo;s possession to a very moderate proportion, and such as he might appropriate to himself, without injury to any body, in the first ages of the world, when men were more in danger to be lost, by wandering from their company, in the then vast wilderness of the earth, than to be straitened for want of room to plant in. And the same measure may be allowed still without prejudice to any body, as full as the world seems: for supposing a man, or family, in the state they were at first peopling of the world by the children of Adam, or Noah; let him plant in some inland, vacant places of America, we shall find that the possessions he could make himself, upon the measures we have given, would not be very large, nor, even to this day, prejudice the rest of mankind, or give them reason to complain, or think themselves injured by this man\u0026rsquo;s incroachment, though the race of men have now spread themselves to all the corners of the world, and do infinitely exceed the small number was at the beginning. Nay, the extent of ground is of so little value, without labour, that I have heard it affirmed, that in Spain itself a man may be permitted to plough, sow and reap, without being disturbed, upon land he has no other title to, but only his making use of it. But, on the contrary, the inhabitants think themselves beholden to him, who, by his industry on neglected, and consequently waste land, has increased the stock of corn, which they wanted. But be this as it will, which I lay no stress on; this I dare boldly affirm, that the same rule of propriety, (viz.) that every man should have as much as he could make use of, would hold still in the world, without straitening any body; since there is land enough in the world to suffice double the inhabitants, had not the invention of money, and the tacit agreement of men to put a value on it, introduced (by consent) larger possessions, and a right to them; which, how it has done, I shall by and by shew more at large.\nThis is certain, that in the beginning, before the desire of having more than man needed had altered the intrinsic value of things, which depends only on their usefulness to the life of man; or had agreed, that a little piece of yellow metal, which would keep without wasting or decay, should be worth a great piece of flesh, or a whole heap of corn; though men had a right to appropriate, by their labour, each one of himself, as much of the things of nature, as he could use: yet this could not be much, nor to the prejudice of others, where the same plenty was still left to those who would use the same industry. To which let me add, that he who appropriates land to himself by his labour, does not lessen, but increase the common stock of mankind: for the provisions serving to the support of human life, produced by one acre of inclosed and cultivated land, are (to speak much within compass) ten times more than those which are yielded by an acre of land of an equal richness lying waste in common. And therefore he that incloses land, and has a greater plenty of the conveniencies of life from ten acres, than he could have from an hundred left to nature, may truly be said to give ninety acres to mankind: for his labour now supplies him with provisions out of ten acres, which were but the product of an hundred lying in common. I have here rated the improved land very low, in making its product but as ten to one, when it is much nearer an hundred to one: for I ask, whether in the wild woods and uncultivated waste of America, left to nature, without any improvement, tillage or husbandry, a thousand acres yield the needy and wretched inhabitants as many conveniencies of life, as ten acres of equally fertile land do in Devonshire, where they are well cultivated?\nBefore the appropriation of land, he who gathered as much of the wild fruit, killed, caught, or tamed, as many of the beasts, as he could; he that so imployed his pains about any of the spontaneous products of nature, as any way to alter them from the state which nature put them in, by placing any of his labour on them, did thereby acquire a propriety in them: but if they perished, in his possession, without their due use; if the fruits rotted, or the venison putrified, before he could spend it, he offended against the common law of nature, and was liable to be punished; he invaded his neighbour\u0026rsquo;s share, for he had no right, farther than his use called for any of them, and they might serve to afford him conveniencies of life.\nThe same measures governed the possession of land too: whatsoever he tilled and reaped, laid up and made use of, before it spoiled, that was his peculiar right; whatsoever he enclosed, and could feed, and make use of, the cattle and product was also his. But if either the grass of his enclosure rotted on the ground, or the fruit of his planting perished without gathering, and laying up, this part of the earth, notwithstanding his enclosure, was still to be looked on as waste, and might be the possession of any other. Thus, at the beginning, Cain might take as much ground as he could till, and make it his own land, and yet leave enough to Abel\u0026rsquo;s sheep to feed on; a few acres would serve for both their possessions. But as families increased, and industry inlarged their stocks, their possessions inlarged with the need of them; but yet it was commonly without any fixed property in the ground they made use of, till they incorporated, settled themselves together, and built cities; and then, by consent, they came in time, to set out the bounds of their distinct territories, and agree on limits between them and their neighbours; and by laws within themselves, settled the properties of those of the same society: for we see, that in that part of the world which was first inhabited, and therefore like to be best peopled, even as low down as Abraham\u0026rsquo;s time, they wandered with their flocks, and their herds, which was their substance, freely up and down; and this Abraham did, in a country where he was a stranger. Whence it is plain, that at least a great part of the land lay in common; that the inhabitants valued it not, nor claimed property in any more than they made use of. But when there was not room enough in the same place, for their herds to feed together, they by consent, as Abraham and Lot did, Gen. xiii. 5. separated and inlarged their pasture, where it best liked them. And for the same reason Esau went from his father, and his brother, and planted in mount Seir, Gen. xxxvi. 6.\nAnd thus, without supposing any private dominion, and property in Adam, over all the world, exclusive of all other men, which can no way be proved, nor any one\u0026rsquo;s property be made out from it; but supposing the world given, as it was, to the children of men in common, we see how labour could make men distinct titles to several parcels of it, for their private uses; wherein there could be no doubt of right, no room for quarrel.\nNor is it so strange, as perhaps before consideration it may appear, that the property of labour should be able to over-balance the community of land: for it is labour indeed that puts the difference of value on every thing; and let any one consider what the difference is between an acre of land planted with tobacco or sugar, sown with wheat or barley, and an acre of the same land lying in common, without any husbandry upon it, and he will find, that the improvement of labour makes the far greater part of the value. I think it will be but a very modest computation to say, that of the products of the earth useful to the life of man nine tenths are the effects of labour: nay, if we will rightly estimate things as they come to our use, and cast up the several expences about them, what in them is purely owing to nature, and what to labour, we shall find, that in most of them ninety-nine hundredths are wholly to be put on the account of labour.\n[…]\nAnd thus, I think, it is very easy to conceive, without any difficulty, how labour could at first begin a title of property in the common things of nature, and how the spending it upon our uses bounded it. So that there could then be no reason of quarrelling about title, nor any doubt about the largeness of possession it gave. Right and conveniency went together; for as a man had a right to all he could employ his labour upon, so he had no temptation to labour for more than he could make use of. This left no room for controversy about the title, nor for encroachment on the right of others; what portion a man carved to himself, was easily seen; and it was useless, as well as dishonest, to carve himself too much, or take more than he needed.\n"},{"id":28,"href":"/lessons/week11/","title":"Right to Shelter","section":"Lessons","content":"While accurate data on the circumstances of unhoused people can be difficult to get, Canada is clearly experiencing a rise in chronic homelessness, even as shelter capacity in many cities has increased following the COVID-19 pandemic.

The podcast tells the story of how a restrictive covenant is shaping urban development in the context of the city\u0026rsquo;s long-term strategy to improve access to affordable housing and achieve a more equitable distribution of that housing across the municipality. If you prefer, the website also contains a print version of the radio documentary.\nThe provisions of the restrictive covenant at 3000 Funston Street are included on the website\u0026ndash;they are as follows:\nAll lots in Brukenwoods Annex shall be subject to the following restrictions, covenants and conditions:\nAll lots in the tract shall be known and described as residential lots. No structures shall be erected, altered, placed or permitted to remain on any residential building plot other than one detached single family residence, or one duplex apartment, except that private garages for not more than three cars may be constructed and may be attached to or detached from the main residence structure, and servants quarters or one garage apartment may be constructed only after the main residence structure is completed.\nNo building shall be located on any residential building plot nearer than 25 ft. to the front lot line, no nearer than 12 ft. to any side street line. No building except a garage or other out-building located 90 ft. or more from the front lot line shall be located nearer than 5 ft. to any side lot line.\nNo residential structure shall be erected or placed on any building plot, which lot has an area of less than 5750 square ft. or a width of less than 50 ft. at the front building setback line as shown on the recorded plat.\nNo noxious or offensive trade or activity shall be carried on upon any lot, nor shall anything be done thereon which may be or become and annoyance or nuisance to the neighbourhood.\nNo persons of any race other than the white race shall use or occupy any building or any lot, except that this covenant shall not prevent occupant by domestic servants of a different race domiciled with an owner or tenant.\nNo trailer, basement, tent, shack, garage, barn or other out-building erected in the tract shall at any time be used as a residence temporarily or permanently, nor shall any structure of a temporary character be used as a residence.\nThe ground floor area on the main residence structure erected on any building plot shall not be less than 750 square feet for Lots 1 to 16, inclusive, and not less than 850 square feed for Lots 17 to 21, inclusive, each being exclusive of one story open porches and garages.\nThese covenants are to run with the land and shall be binding on all parts and all persons claiming under them until January 1, 1966 at which time said covenants shall be automatically extended for successive periods of ten years unless by vote of the majority of the then owners of the lots it is agreed to change the said covenants in whole or in part.\nIf the parties hereto or any of them or their heirs or assigns shall violate or attempt to violate any of the covenants herein, it shall be lawful for any other person or persons owning any real property situated in said development or subdivision to prospector any proceedings at law or in equity against the person or person violating or attempting to violate any such covenant and whether to prevent him or them from so doing or to recover damages or other dues for such violations.\nInvalidation of any one of these covenants by judgement or court order shall in no wise affect any of the other provisions which shall remain in full force and effect.\nSuppose that the facts surrounding 3000 Funston Street take place in a Canadian city like Halifax. Which provisions of the restrictive covenant above might limit the use of the land for the development of affordable housing as envisioned by the City of Austin? Would such provisions be valid and enforceable in Canadian law?\nBoth Canada and the United States have a long, troubling history of upholding the type of racially restrictive covenants seen in Clause 5 of the 3000 Funston Street covenant. These clauses are no longer enforceable in Canadian law (though in some places, like this West Vancouver neighbourhood, such clauses formally remain on title).\nBut suppose that one of the residents of Funston Street makes a will, naming their two surviving adult children as the sole beneficiaries. The will establishes a private trust with the eldest child as trustee, the terms of which stipulate that the youngest only receive their share of the trust property if and when they divorce and cease to cohabitate with their spouse. If the youngest child fails to meet this condition within five years of the testator’s decease, the whole residue of the estate will pass to the other beneficiary.\nAfter the will takes effect, the youngest child brings an action challenging the validity of the will. They argue that it is well known within the family that the condition was included because the testator\u0026ndash;in the testator\u0026rsquo;s words\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;disapproved\u0026rdquo; of the youngest child having married their spouse, who was born in Southeast Asia and immigrated to Canada as a teenager. While the will itself makes no mention of the reasons for the bequest or the specific condition, the youngest child claims to possess written and oral evidence outside the will that expresses the testator’s racist views.\nHow would you describe the property interests created in the bequest? Do you think the youngest child is likely to succeed in challenging the will?\n"},{"id":31,"href":"/lessons/week12/","title":"Restrictive Covenants and Qualified Interests","section":"Lessons","content":"In the last few weeks, we have emphasized that modern, forward-looking land use planning and zoning regimes emerged in Canada by the mid-20th century to replace more decentralized and reactive forms of land-use control, such as private nuisance actions adjudicated by the common law courts.

Membertou wishes to preserve and protect its relationship with the lands and waters as well as to ensure sustainability and appropriate stewardship for the benefit of future generations;\nWHEREAS Membertou hereby recognizes and affirms the existence of Treaty and Aboriginal Rights as separate, distinct and unaffected by this Land Code;\nWHEREAS Membertou hereby recognizes and affirms the collective rights of its members to the land, water and resources;\nWHEREAS Membertou has entered into the Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management with Canada, as amended, and which was ratified on behalf of the Government of Canada by the First Nations Land Management Act;\nAND WHEREAS Membertou, as an aspect of its unextinguished right to self-determination and its unextinguished and inherent right of self-governance, has jurisdiction to create rules for the resolution of issues on Membertou lands, waters and resources, rather than having its lands, waters and their resources managed on its behalf under the Indian Act or any other statute;\nNOW THEREFORE, this Land Code is hereby enacted as the fundamental land law of Membertou as follows:\n[…]\n3.6 The structures, organizations and procedures established by or under its Land Code shall be interpreted in accordance with the culture, traditions and customs of Membertou, unless otherwise provided.\n3.7 The Mi’kmaw language may be used to clarify the meaning of any provision in this Land Code, if the meaning of that provision is not otherwise clear in English.\n[…]\n7.1 The [Band] Council may, in accordance with this Land Code, make laws respecting the development, conservation, protection, management, use and possession of Membertou Land, Waters and Resources, and Interests and Licenses in relation to those Membertou Land, Waters and Resources. This power includes the power to make laws in relation to any matter necessary or ancillary to the making of laws in relation to Membertou Lands, Water and Resources.\n[…]\n25.5 A person who is not a Member may hold a lease, licence, easement, mortgage or permit in Membertou lands.\n25.6 The written consent of Council shall be obtained for the original grant of a lease, licence, easement or permit in community land, waters and resources to a person who is not a Member.\n25.7 Notwithstanding section 25.5, if Council has consented to the original grant of a lease in Membertou Land, Waters and Resources to a person who is not a Member, that leasehold interest may be subsequently mortgaged, transferred or assigned without the consent of Council or approval of members.\n28.1 Council may enact laws providing for an Interest in Membertou Land, Waters and Resources that entitles a Member holding that Interest to:\n(a) permanent possession of the land;\n(b) benefit from the resources in and of the land;\n(c) grant subsidiary interests, licences and permits in the land;\n(d) transfer, devise or otherwise dispose of the land to another Member; and\n(e) any other rights, consistent with this Land Code, that are attached to Certificates of Possession under the Indian Act.\n28.2 For greater certainty, no interest under section 28.1, may be granted to or held by a person who is not a Member.\n28.3 Members may transfer or assign their Interest in Membertou Land, Waters and Resources to Membertou or a Member without the consent of Council.\n[…]\n28.5 There shall be no transfer or assignment of an Interest in Membertou land without the written consent of Council, except for:\n(a) transfers between Members;\n(b) transfers that occur by operation of law, including transfers of estate by testamentary disposition; and\n(c) transfers in accordance with the Membertou Family Homes Law, 2016. reserve law.\nQuestions # How are the problems described by Senator Christmas shaped by Anglo-Canadian legal structures of property and lands governance defined under the Indian Act and by court decisions interpreting this legislation?\nHow does the Membertou Land Code change the structure of property and lands governance on Membertou\u0026rsquo;s reserve lands?

We have traced the evolution of that doctrine from the Royal Proclamation in 1763, through St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling in the late nineteenth century and Calder and Guerin in the late twentieth century. The contemporary path of the Aboriginal title doctrine since those cases has been charted through a combination of constitutional reform, litigation in the courts, and negotiation between Indigenous nations and the Crown.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada\u0026rsquo;s landmark ruling in Delgamuukw in 1997—building on the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and treaty rights in section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982—laid much of the jurisprudential groundwork for the contemporary doctrine. But it was not until several years later, with the Court\u0026rsquo;s decision in Tsilhqot\u0026rsquo;in, that a claim for recognition of Aboriginal title was successfully made out. In the intervening years, the Supreme Court also established the basis for the Crown\u0026rsquo;s constitutional duty to consult with Indigenous communities where state action was contemplated that might infringe on Aboriginal title before it was proven in court.\nThe contemporary doctrine of common law Aboriginal title is complex—made even more so by the web of legal and political relationships that form the importance context in which critical issues around the doctrine must be addressed. Our goal this week is the understand the crucial elements of this doctrine that build on material we have developed through our course and to identify key unanswered questions for this area of law going forward.\nOur Problem this Week # Our problem this week develops the modern framework for Aboriginal title claims under section 35 of the Constitution Act:: Mi\u0026rsquo;gmawe\u0026rsquo;l Tplu\u0026rsquo;taqnn Inc.

To better understand the legal groundwork for this debate, we now return to the basic question of what rights are afforded to someone in possession of land but who lacks formal title. Asher v Whitlock, below, engages the issue of what happens when two claimants—neither of whom hold title—make competing claims to land. In the course of answering that question, the Court elaborates on the rights of parties in possession. Because of the style in which some mid-nineteenth century law reports were written—presenting the lawyers at trial in dialogue with the judges, followed by the court\u0026rsquo;s final judgement—Asher also provides an opportunity to reconnect with ideas about patterns of common law argument that we addressed in Unit 1.\nAsher v Whitlock illustrates and affirms a basic premise we encountered in weeks 4 and 5: possession and title are distinctive legal concepts. However, the case also tells us something more. First, possessory rights can co-exist with title (notice that the title holder is not actually a party in Asher). Second, in the face of conflicting possessory claims, the common law has developed a rule to resolve those claims.

Defendants\u0026rsquo; (Kane\u0026rsquo;s) vessel, the only one then in sight, was also jammed in the same ice and lay about eight miles S. S. E. of the Brothers. Plaintiffs\u0026rsquo; crew killed, as they computed, about 3,000 seals, of which some were sculped and piled, some were cut open, and others were left round. One hundred and fifty were taken on board in the course of the day, and a flag was set up to mark the place where the rest were to be found, which was about two miles from the vessel. On the following Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, plaintiffs\u0026rsquo; crew continued to haul their dead seals, bringing on board about three hundred each day; but, upon Wednesday, the ice and the vessels shifted their positions so as to remove the seals further away from the plaintiffs\u0026rsquo; vessel and to bring them much closer to Kane\u0026rsquo;s. On Wednesday Kane\u0026rsquo;s men did not interfere with the dead seals, but on Thursday, the Brothers being then about four miles from them and Kane\u0026rsquo;s vessel being in their midst, the crew of the latter vessel occupied themselves all day in hauling them on board their own ship. The crew of the Brothers also went to the seals on that day and brought one small tow on board, but, partly on account of the distance and the difficulty of hauling, and partly because, as they supposed, Kane had secured what remained, did not return for a second tow. On the next day, Friday, there occurred a change of wind and an opening of the ice, which would have enabled the Brothers to reach the pans where they had left their seals, but her captain did not proceed thither, being under the belief that none remained on the ice, and shortly after both vessels returned to St. John\u0026rsquo;s.\nThe defendant (Kane) admitted having taken, on Thursday and Friday, about six hundred and forty dead seals on the ice in question, but contended that some of these had been killed by men from the shore, and that what he had taken of those killed by Barbor\u0026rsquo;s crew were for the most part round and scattered, and could not have been recovered by the plaintiffs\u0026rsquo; men, and that he, the defendant, had, therefore, the right in law to take them and appropriate them wholly to his own use.\nThe jury were directed by the court to say: first, whether the plaintiffs\u0026rsquo; servants had killed any seals, and by taking measures to identify and recover them by the use of flags, by sculping, piling, cutting, marking or such like means, had reduced them into possession; secondly, if so, whether defendant (Kane) and his crew had taken any of these seals. If they had, the jury should find a verdict for the plaintiff—1st, for their whole value if taken unnecessarily, that is, wrongfully, the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s crew having the power of recovering them if not meddled with; or, 2ndly, for the whole value, less salvage, if taken necessarily, that is, to save them from total loss, the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s crew having no power to recover them.\nTo this ruling, Mr. Pinsent, for the defendants, excepted that the jury should have been told that if the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s crew had no power to recover the seals their right of property in them had been lost and the verdict should be for the defendants; that there was no proof of a joint conversion as against the defendants, Baine, Johnston \u0026amp; Co.; that the present plaintiffs were entitled to sue for half the seals only; and that there was a misdirection in telling the jury that the only custom proven applied to a scattered round seal, and in not directing the jury that the valuation should have been estimated in relation to the circumstances, and that if there were a mixture or confusion of the plaintiffs seals with those of others without distinguishing them, there would be no right of property as against the defendants.\nThe jury found for the plaintiffs for $952 by a special verdict, by which they declared that in their opinion the plaintiffs had not the power of recovering the seals at the ice.\nA rule nisi, founded on the above exceptions, was heard and argued during the present term, and of this rule we have now to dispose.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe first exception, as involving a principle of great practical importance in the prosecution of the seal fishery, and as one upon which a diversity of opinion appears to exist, requires a more particular consideration. It maintains that the jury should have been told, in opposition to the ruling at the trial, that if, after killing the seals and dealing with them in the manner described, the crew of the Brothers had, by the shifting of the ice or the chances of wind or weather, been prevented from finally getting them on board their vessel, the seals returned to the common stock and became the property of the first finder who chose to appropriate them. To this position I am unable to subscribe as it is, in my opinion, unsound in principle and unsupported by authority, and I am constrained to hold, after much consideration and some research, that the direction given to the jury on this point is the only one that can be sustained. This direction was in effect that by killing the seals and reducing them into possession in the manner described, the plaintiffs, through their crew, had obtained an absolute property in them, and would be entitled, subject in a certain event to the payment of salvage, to recover them from any person into whose hands they might afterwards come. This statement, comprises two positions: first, that the killing, seizing and dealing with the seals by piling, sculping, etc., in other words, reducing them into possession vested an absolute property in them in the party so killing and dealing with the seals; and secondly, that the property once absolutely vested could not lie divested out of the owner without his consent, except by certain exceptional causes having no application here.\nFor the first position I cite the following authorities. In 2 St. Com. p 81, it is said:—\u0026ldquo;With regard to animals ferae naturae, all mankind had by original grant of the Creator a right to pursue and take any fowl or insect of the air, any fish or inhabitant of the waters; and this natural right still continues in every individual, unless when it is restrained by the civil laws of the country. By the laws of this realm accordingly, all persons may on their own lands or in the seas in general, exercise this right, and when a man has once seized animals of this description they become, if reclaimed or confined according to the doctrine laid down in a previous chapter, his qualified property, or if dead are absolutely his own, so that to steal them or otherwise to invade this property is, according to the nature of the sometimes a criminal offence, sometimes only a civil injury.\u0026rdquo; So in Blackstone, vol. 2, p 403, \u0026ldquo;and when a man has once so seized them, (i.e., animals ferae naturae) they become while living his qualified property, or if dead are absolutely his own\u0026rdquo;—5O, 2 Tomlin\u0026rsquo;s Law Dictionary, citing under the head \u0026ldquo;Property,\u0026rdquo; Dalton 371-Finch 176-11 Reports, 50 Raym, 16—\u0026ldquo;one may have an absolute property in things of a base nature, as dogs, but not in things ferae naturae, unless dead,\u0026rdquo; and in Bacon\u0026rsquo;s Abridgement, vol. 4, p. 1, Title \u0026ldquo;Game,\u0026rdquo; it is laid down generally, that animals ferae naturae, belong to the parties taking and killing them in the same manner as any other chattels.\n2ndly,—As regards the divesting of the property, once absolutely vested—to contend that a person would lose or be deprived of his right of property in dead seals which he had piled on the ice, while awaiting an opportunity to take them on board his vessel, by a whirl of the ice or a change in the wind or the weather, carrying them out of his reach, is to say that any accident which may happen to deprive him of the possession of his property will deprive him of all right to it. For such a position I venture to think no authority can he found in the books. If a man lose his purse or his coat (and I have shown that as regards the right of property, no difference exists between one inanimate chattel and another) he is thus deprived of the possession, the profitable use, and beneficial enjoyment of it, but his right of property in it remains unaltered, and any one who finds it must restore it. Where is the authority which declares that with the possession, or the power of recovering possession, the right of property also departs? On the contrary, the authorities are the other way, thus in 2 Bl. p. 9 \u0026amp; 1 St., Co. p. 149, it is thus laid down: \u0026ldquo;Property both in lands and moveables being thus originally acquired by the first taker it remains in him by the principles of universal law, till such time as he does some other act which shows an intention to abandon it, for then it becomes publici juris once more. So if one is possessed of a jewel and casts it into the sea, or a highway, this is such an express dereliction that the property will be vested in the first finder—not so if he hides it and it is discovered, there the finder acquires no property, and if he loses or drops it by accident, it cannot be collected from thence, that he designed to quit the possession, and, therefore, in such a case, the property still remains in the loser, who may claim it against of the finder.\u0026rdquo;\nFurther, in the second vol. of the same work, where it treats of the various modes by which property may be acquired, I find none enumerated except such as depend upon the will of the owner (assignment, for instance), and those already referred to as inapplicable, namely, by operation of law, as by forfeiture, seizure under proces, sale in market overt, etc. I find no head of title by finding, except in cases of abandonment,—abandonment not, be it observed, of the search or of the hope of recovery, but of the right of property. In the present case, however, there was not only no evidence of abandonment, but the whole of the plaintiffs\u0026rsquo; case went to show there was no abandonment. The only questions, therefore, for the jury, as regards the plaintiffs\u0026rsquo; right of recovery, were: 1st\u0026ndash;had the property in these seals vested in the plaintiffs, a compound question of law and fact, to be determined by the application of the law as stated by the court to the facts, of killing, sculping, piling, etc., if found by the jury; and 2nd\u0026ndash;had the defendants taken them? If so, the probability that the plaintiffs could not have recovered them from the ice became immaterial except in considering the amount of damages where it received full effect, in the direction to allow salvage, and this exception, consequently fails.\nIn his argument on the rule nisi, Mr. Pinsent seemed to contend that the means mentioned in the charge \u0026ldquo;killing, sculping, etc.\u0026rdquo; did not form or constitute that reduction into possession which is necessary to create property in animals ferae naturae, and that it was also necessary for this purpose that the first taker should be in a position to secure and continue the possession he had originally obtained, by taking the seals on board his vessel, or, at least, by having the ability to do so, the accidents of the sea notwithstanding.\nNeither of these conditions, however, are prescribed as essential by the authorities which I have cited, and with the exception of two local decisions, to which I shall presently refer, none of those mentioned by Mr. Pinsent sustain his position, as they all relate to living animals, as to which it is not denied that they can only be the subject of a qualified property which terminates with their escape.\nThus, the passage in 2 Bl., p. 14, \u0026ldquo;all these things, so long as they remain in possession, every man has a right to enjoy without disturbance, but if once they escape from his custody, etc\u0026rdquo;, plainly applies to the live animal having the power within itself of escaping, and not to the dead carcass which may be lost but cannot escape; so with the passage in Tomlin, \u0026ldquo;If a swarm of bees light upon a tree they are not the owner\u0026rsquo;s of the tree till covered with his hive\u0026rdquo;; so with the whale cases in 1 Taunton. And the analogy attempted to be drawn between bees once hived flying away and escaping though pursued by the owner, who thus loses his qualified property in them, and dead seals, floated away by the ice, fails on the same ground. In the live animal the possessor had a qualified property only, which ceased when it escaped. In the dead seal, an inanimate chattel, he had an absolute property which accidental loss or wrongful deprivation of his possession could not affect. The case of Young vs. Hickens, 6 Q B., is one in which the plaintiff had neither property nor possession in the fish the subject of the action, they being not only alive but at liberty; and the injury done consisted, not in depriving him of property already obtained, but in preventing him from acquiring it.\nThe only conditions required by the authorities for the acquisition of an absolute property in animals, ferae naturae, are killing and seizure\u0026ndash;to insist further that the taker should have the power of permanently continuing in possession, or should not be subject to accidental loss, or should take the property on board his ship, seems to me to be requiring conditions unknown to the law, conditions purely arbitrary, since with as much reason might it be required that the seals should be brought into port as that they should be taken on board ship, as they are exposed to the perils of the sea and the chances of loss in one case as well as in the other.\nIt by no means follows, however, as Mr. Pinsent further contended, that under shelter of the principle excepted to by him, it would be competent, for any person to go upon the ice, and by \u0026ldquo;slaughtering right and left,\u0026rdquo; establish a property in the seals he killed, thus depriving others of them while he could not retain them for himself. Merely killing without seizing, that is, taking possession, would not avail to establish a property; one cannot obtain the property in a flying gull by simply shooting it from tho deck of a ship, nor in a seal by shooting it on a pan to which he cannot obtain access; but if in addition to the killing, he expend time and labor in obtaining corporal possession of the dead animal, he will then have acquired an absolute property in it, which it would be hard that he should be deprived of by accidental loss.\nThe same principles would, of course, govern the case put during the argument of the whale supposed to be killed off the Western Islands, and subsequently picked up in St. Mary\u0026rsquo;s Bay. If the whale was killed merely, and not seized or taken into possession, the killer would have no claim on the finder, but if in addition to the killing he had, taken possession of it, its accidental loss would not deprive him of his property, but he would be entitled to claim it, subject to salvage, in like manner as he could claim a bale of goods washed off the deck of his ship or cast overboard in a storm—2 Bl. (557 Abbott, 8k. 410).\nMuch reliance was placed by Mr. Pinsent upon the alleged fact that in actions heretofore brought in our courts for the recovery of seals wrongfully taken at the ice, the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s right to recover was made by the judges to depend upon the probability of his recovering his seals had they not been interfered with, and that this circumstance was generally made an important point in the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s case.\nHad the question now under consideration ever been formally raised, argued and determined before the full court, and decided as Mr. Pinsent contends it ought now to be, it would even in such case, having regard to the important effect such a decision would have on the right of property in one of the great staples of our industry, be a very grave question whether if clearly erroneous it ought not to be over-ruled, as in a matter of such moment, where a sound ratio decidendi would be of more importance than uniformity in error, it would certainly be our duty rather to correct than follow the mistakes of our predecessors, if such they were.\nNo such decision of the full court, however, can be cited, and I am of opinion, judging from my own experience, which though differing I believe from my learned brother judge, Robinson\u0026rsquo;s, seems to me to be confirmed by the only reported cases I have been able to see, that Mr. Pinsent\u0026rsquo;s statement in this respect was much too broad.\nAssuming, as Mr. Pinsent contends, that the power of recovering the seals at the ice was a condition precedent to the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s right of recovering in the action, it ought to have been expressly put by the judge to the jury in every case; but if, as Mr. Carter contends, and as I think rightly, this power was of importance only in relation to the damages, it would only be put by the judge when expressly raised on the defence. In the former view the question would always arise, in the latter for a different purpose very frequently, for the contest in seal cases having been almost invariably as to the taking by the defendant (a charge denied by him and affirmed by the plaintiff), the power of recovery would naturally be mooted in the course of the trial, not merely in relation to the damages, but because the fact of the seals having been taken by some one would best be established by shewing that the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s crew recovered the pan on which they had been piled, a piece of evidence which would for the most part establish the power of recovery.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe present case then, being the first within my experience, in which the defendant, avowing the taking of the seals, rests his defence upon this ground, and brings it before the full court for deliberate determination, comes to us as one primae impressionis. It has been well argued at the bar, and after full consideration I am clearly of opinion that in an action of trover for seals taken at the ice, it is in law no defence to say that if not taken by the defendants the plaintiff in all probability could not have secured them.\nIn pursuing this inquiry I have had no regard to the supposed expediency or equity of either of the rule contended for, because considerations of that kind, although sometimes useful in aiding the construction of a doubtful statute by throwing light upon the intentions of the Legislature, are apt in other cases unduly to bias the mind of the judge, whose only duty it is to discover what the law is, whatever may be its character, and having found, to declare it.\nI cannot, however, accept the suggestion that the law, as I hold it to be, would be either inexpedient or unjust; on the contrary, I believe that it best accords with sound principles of public policy and with natural equity.\nPanned seals, drifted out of the possession of the owner, would not be left by third parties falling in with them to float away and become lost to the general wealth of the community, merely because the right of property was preserved to the original taker. The certainty of a liberal salvage, and the probability of their never being claimed, would always be sufficient inducements to the finder to bring them into port.\nNor would actions at law be multiplied by reason of the original taker of lost seals instituting proceedings against every one who might bring in seals which he himself had not killed. The difficulty of identification in such cases, and the fear of costs, would sufficiently restrain such speculative litigation.\nOn the other hand, by making the right to recover in an action dependent upon the probable ability to regain possession, the title to such property would be rendered precarious and uncertain by being based, not upon matter of fact, but upon matter of opinion; while at the ice a sense of insecurity and a feeling of suspicion and mistrust would be engendered on the part of its possessor, and the desire for the fruits of another\u0026rsquo;s industry on the part of less fortunate neighbours which would not tend to promote those kindly feelings, and that respect for each other\u0026rsquo;s rights which ought to actuate men engaged in the same pursuit, particularly a pursuit so hazardous as the seal fishery; and a strong temptation would be held out to crews at the ice to appropriate panned seals under any circumstances, since if their possession were afterwards successfully questioned in a court of law, they would lose, besides costs, nothing that they ever owned, while their chance of retaining their plunder would be greatly increased, as it might easily be made contingent upon their being able to satisfy a jury that reliance should be placed upon their opinion of the inability of the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s crew to regain possession.\nIt is true this temptation would also exist if the inability to regain possession could only affect the amount of damages, but it would exist in a comparatively trifling degree, and cases of wrongful taking and consequently actions on that account would be less numerous, and where resort was necessarily had to legal proceedings, the taking would frequently be admitted with a view to salvage, and much of that conflict of testimony which we sometimes find and which is so painful to witness would be avoided.\nAs a matter of equity the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s better position cannot I think be questioned. The principle for which the defendants contend would altogether deprive the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s crew of valuable property, on which they had expended much time and labor, and about which they had incurred great personal risk, solely because by an accident beyond their control they were unfortunate enough to lose their possession of it, and would give it to the defendant who had not laboured for it, and whose whole merit consisted in taking it on board their ship when it was brought by the currents within their reach. The true principle regarding this property as a common fund created by one party and saved by the other, would recognize the just claims of both and give both compensation for their labor, by sharing the fund between them. What could be more just or reasonable?\nJudge Hayward concurring in opinion with me, this rule must be discharged.\nRobinson J. — # After the best consideration I can give this subject, I cannot arrive at any other conclusion than that the rule for a new trial should be made absolute on the ground of misdirection in two particulars, and on the ground that one of the principal issues raised by the pleadings, viz., whether the plaintiffs had property in the seals, was determined by the Court and was not submitted to the jury.\nThe action was brought to recover damages for the wrongful conversion of the pelts of certain seals which the plaintiffs allege they had killed, and sculped, and left on the ice several miles from their vessel during the last seal fishery.\nThe defendants filed two pleas, 1st, denying that they had taken the pelts; and 2nd, denying that such pelts were the property of the plaintiffs.\nActions similar to the present have been common in our Courts. I have been engaged in the trial of many both as counsel and judge, and, up to the present, I do not remember and cannot find a report or record of a single one, in which it was not the ruling of the Court that to vest in the plaintiffs such property and possession as would enable him to recover, he must satisfy the jury not only that he killed the seals, but that they continued under his control, that he had not abandoned the intention to return, and the hope to recover them, and that he had a reasonable prospect of being enabled to take them into his complete possession by putting them on board his vessel if the defendants had not interfered with him.\nWhether such direction was coeval with the seal fishery, or whether it arose after the usage thereat had been proved and established and therefore had become settled law which judges are bound to notice judicially, or when or how it arose I cannot say; this much I can assert, that during my experience at the bar and on the bench, embracing a period of forty years, such was the law invariably laid down by the Court. I do not recollect one instance in which it was questioned, no record of any exception to that ruling is produced (although in every case it was obviously the interest of one side or the other to have challenged it if erroneous) but the law has, up to the trial of this case, so far as I know and believe, been acquiesced in by judges, bar, and suitors, and has regulated the procedure of the Court.\nMr. Pinsent, in his able argument, has referred to the reports of two trials similar to the present, that were published in 1858, and they are conformable with my experience of the law heretofore administered in such cases, whilst none have been cited to the contrary.\nOn the trial of this cause, last term, I proposed to adhere to the ruling thus established, and to deliver to the jury the following direction, which I wrote at the time:\nPlaintiff entitled to recover if he reduced into full possession any seals which Kane afterwards took, and plaintiff reduces seals into such possession by\n1st. Killing them.\n2nd. By taking measures to identify and recover them by sculping, cutting, marking, piling or such like means.\n3rd By not abandoning the hope of recovering, and intention of returning to them, and\n4th. By being able to get them on board if not prevented by Kane.\nFirst question.—Did Kane take any seals of plaintiffs so circumstanced? If yea, verdict for plaintiff for their value. Second question.—If none, verdict for defendants.\nMy learned brethren, however, were of opinion that from the elements which constituted the plaintiffs\u0026rsquo; property, should be excluded their intention to return, their hope to recover and their power to secure the seals on board; holding that their property became absolute by merely killing the seals; and they also determined that the jury might, under a certain contingency, allow the defendants salvage.\nSuch being the opinion of the majority of the Court, the direction to the jury was given in the words written by the Chief Justice, as follows:\nFirst question is: Did plaintiff kill and reduce into possession, by taking measures to identify and recover them by the use of flags, by sculping, piling, cutting, marking, or such like means?\nSecond.—If so, did defendant take any of these seals?\nThird,—If both questions answered in the affirmative find for plaintiff.\n1st, for whole value if taken unnecessarily, i.e., plaintiff having power to recover.\n2nd, for whole value, less salvage, if taken necessarily, i.e., plaintiff having no power to recover.\nThe jury, on this direction, found a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for $952, adding, that in their opinion the seals had been lost by the plaintiffs, and were taken by the defendants when the plaintiffs had not any power to recover them at the ice, and that the jury had made in their verdict, an allowance to the defendants on account of salvage.\nTo unsettle the law which a long and uninterrupted series of decisions had established, can hardly fail to occasion confusion and injury in a commercial community, and the present case furnishes a striking instance of the effect of such disturbance. Under the former ruling of our Courts, the facts here found by the jury would have resulted in a verdict for the defendants, whereas in consequence of the new interpretation of the law, they result in a verdict for the plaintiffs.\nIn my judgment the former ruling was correct, and it is the latter interpretation that is erroneous, not only by reason of the Court ignoring the usage of the seal-fishery which had ascertained the facts requisite to constitute ownership of seals at the ice, without taking the opinion of the jury as to what other facts are requisite, but also by reason of the Court introducing the question of salvage in relation to damages.\nTo dispose of this last point first—\nIt is observable that the defendants did not prefer any claim in the nature of a set-off for salvage, such a claim has never been recognized in seal cases before, and in an action of trover a set-off is not admissible at all. There is only one way in which a claim for salvage could, in such an action, properly arise, namely, as a bar to the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s right to recover, but that was not the way in which it was here put to the Court, if it had been the result must have been different, for a plaintiff cannot recover in trover, unless he had, at the time of conversion, the right to immediate possession, as well as the property—Roscoe 638; but the plaintiffs here had no such right to possession by reason of the defendant\u0026rsquo;s claim upon the seals for salvage—(\u0026ldquo;an action of trover will not lie to recover wrecked goods before tender of expenses.\u0026quot;—Hartford v. Jones, Lord Ray, 393)—the action therefore was premature, and the defendants were entitled to a non-suit, or to a verdict—2 Sel. Np. 1353, instead whereof, the verdict is for the plaintiffs, but for a sum less than they are entitled to, if they are entitled to any, and the defendants are condemned in the whole costs of suit for not delivering up property which they had a lien upon and a legal right to retain.\nIt may be said that this was a short method of doing justice, to speak colloquially, a rough and ready mode of effecting an equitable arrangement between the parties. I am quite convinced that such an arrangement was contemplated, but I doubt the success, and I question the correctness of the proceeding; it is not one which could properly have been introduced in the present case, because the Supreme Court of Newfoundland is bound to administer justice on the same principles that prevail in Westminister Hall; the defendants in an action at law are restricted to legal pleas, they must shape their course by established practice, and expect to have their rights disposed of by the rules of law. It has been seen how a departure from strict law has operated to the prejudice of both parties, and it seems to me that the importation of hypothetical equity does not mend the matter, for I am unable to discover any equity in making one sealer—who secures animals ferae naturae found adrift upon the ocean abandoned by the killer, and lost to all the world,—pay any portion of their value—to another sealer who, although he killed them, had failed, through the ordinary casualties of the fishery, to secure the possession of them, and was obliged, however involuntarily, to abandon the pursuit of them.\nIt has been asked, would it not be fair to allow the man who killed the seal some benefit for his labour? Reading the present by the light of the past I venture to say, no. What he did was not for the benefit of another but of himself; he acquired no right whatever to these wild animals until he secured possession (except the right of uninterrupted pursuit). When he was compelled to abandon them they again became common property, open to all; he who lost them with them lost his labor; he who captured them took them free of all lien, for lien presupposes actual possession.—Kinlock v. Craig, 3 S. R.; Taylor v. Robinson, 8 Saunt.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the direction to the jury, on the subject of salvage, occasioned a miscarriage of justice, and amounted to a misdirection of law.\nThe other misdirection appears to me to have been in the judges undertaking to prescribe the facts necessary to constitute ownership in seal pelts drifting about upon floating ice.\nBy the 2nd plea the fact of ownership was expressly denied, it is the province of a jury to find facts, and when found the judge must apply them to the law. Ownership is therefore a mixed question, compounded of facts and law, and in many instances it is settled by usage. The course pursued in English Courts with reference to whale cases has been to leave a jury to ascertain what facts, by the usage of trade, constitute the right of possession in the whale; the like course ought in my opinion to have been followed in this case, since it was determined to abandon the usage that had heretofore been recognized; but instead thereof the Court assumed that certain acts would establish ownership of seals on the ice, rejecting what I understand to have been the ancient usage that had hitherto been our guide, and ignoring the province of the jury to find any other in its place.\nShips from the United Kingdom, from the United States and Newfoundland are now engaged in the seal-fishery, and it is very desirable that the rule of law which governs the practice of such fishery should be well defined, and as I am so unfortunate as to differ in opinion from my brother judges, as they do from their predecessors, I wish to explain the ground upon which my judgment rests. It seems to me a radical error to place wild animals and domestic animals in the same legal category, because the distinctions between them are many and material, and arise from the fact that the latter are the absolute property of some person indefeasible except by his own act, whilst the former are, by nature\u0026rsquo;s law, common to all, and are only the subject of a qualified property dependant for its acquisition upon special circumstances, and liable to be lost by accidental causes.\nI find the law upon the subject thus laid down in 2 Black C—389, and adopted by the recent and very learned commentator Mr. Serjeant Stephen: \u0026ldquo;In animals of a tame nature such as horses, sheep, \u0026amp;c., \u0026amp;c., a man may have an absolute property as in any inanimate thing, but in animals ferae naturae, a man can have no absolute property,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;he may be invested with a qualified, but not an absolute property in all creatures that are ferae naturae, by reclaiming or so confining them within his own immediate power that they cannot escape and use their natural liberty,\u0026quot;—p. 390. \u0026ldquo;These are no longer the property of a man than while they continue in his keeping or actual possession,\u0026rdquo; and the author gives an example in the case of bees, \u0026ldquo;which are ferae naturae, but, when hived a man may have a qualified property in them,\u0026rdquo; and Bracton adds it is occupation, i.e., hiving and including them that gives the property in bees, \u0026ldquo;though a swarm lights upon my tree, I have no property in them till I have hived them, a swarm which flies out of my hive is mine, so long as I can keep it in sight, and have power to pursue it.\u0026rdquo; Substitute the word \u0026ldquo;seals\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;bees\u0026rdquo; and the word \u0026ldquo;vessel\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;hive\u0026rdquo; and we have the present case, mutado nomine, de te fabula narratur.\nMr. Serjeant Stephen, in his commentary, 1 vol. p. 165, whilst treating of the usufructuary property which a man has in light, air, water, goes on to say, \u0026ldquo;such also are the generality of those animals that are ferae naturae, which so long as they remain in possession every man has a right to enjoy without disturbance, but if once they escape from his custody—though without his voluntary abandonment, it naturally follows that they return to the common stock, and any man else has an equal right to seize and enjoy them afterwards.\u0026rdquo;\nIt is contended that the right is altered by the death of a wild animal, that when once it is killed it becomes the absolute property of the killer, and for that contention a dictum in Blackstone, adopted also by Stephen, is quoted, but with all respect I do not think that such dictum refers to the seal-fishery, or has any relation in principle to the question now under consideration—to cleave to the letter without regard to the spirit of a quotation, is what Lord Coke condemns in the maxim, \u0026ldquo;qui haeret in litera haeret in cortice.\u0026rdquo; When Blackstone speaks of a hunter converting an animal ferae naturae into his absolute property by killing it, he simply means that the hunter thereby gets it into his full possession and control—he chiefly refers to the case of an animal on land, where its death would prevent the probability of its being lost to the killer, and to cases in which the death of the animal is the consummation of the enterprise but in the seal-fishery of Newfoundland every one knows that killing the seal is only one of several steps in the process of reducing its pelt into possession, no doubt it is the first, then follows sculping, then hauling over the ice, (in which act, the pelt is often lost) and finally securing it on board ship; but so long as the seal remains unshipped it is exposed to various casualties which may remove it beyond the power and possession of the killer as completely as if it were alive in the water, and may prevent him effectuating the object of his enterprise.\nIn Bell\u0026rsquo;s principles of Scotch law, title \u0026ldquo;occupancy,\u0026rdquo; it is declared \u0026ldquo;that an act of appropriation to vest the property in animals ferae naturae is effectual only when it is complete.\u0026rdquo; Now of what avail is it that a sealing crew should kill their thousands, if they are unable—through the perils of the sea and the drifting of the ice—to secure the possession of them in their vessel? Then is all their labour in vain, and the object in view utterly defeated, the qualified property which alone they had whilst killing them is lost, and the event in the present case demonstrates that an absolute and indefeasible property had never vested, for the elements defeated it.\nIt may be useful to reflect for a moment upon the consequences that will result from this new doctrine. I will put a suppositious case likely enough to occur. A man kills a number of seals and leaves them on the ice; before he can take them on board, his vessel is sunk by some accident of the sea, his crew are able to save their lives, but are powerless to save their seals; the ice and the seals drift away and are eventually found by a more fortunate sealer, who takes possession of what he finds thus afloat and unguarded, and appropriates to his own use what otherwise would be lost to all the world. By the doctrine now maintained by my learned brothers, the man who avowedly cannot get possession of these seals and save them for himself at the ice, may nevertheless recover them after they have been brought, by the industry of another, into port, and especially by an action of trover, which presupposes a right to possession, that is admitted to have been a physical impossibility.\nOr, suppose another case: A kills a number of seals which he sculps, marks and leaves on the ice; before he can secure them on board, the ice is carried away by wind and tides wholly beyond his reach and control, he afterwards is fortunate enough to fill his vessel with other seals; those first killed are found by B, who takes possession of them and secures them in his vessel. By the doctrine now propounded the first lot became, by the mere act of killing and sculping, the absolute property of the killer, and although he had not means to secure them or bring them into port, he is nevertheless entitled to recover their value from the man who could and did save them.\nThese startling consequences are the necessary result of the novel interpretation of the law now introduced, and of abandoning the ancient usage and simple rule hitherto administered in our Courts, which declared that the right of property in seals at the ice was dependent upon the ability to get them into full possession, by putting them on shipboard or on the shore, as is sometimes done.\nThe case Young v. Hickens, 6 Q.B., 606, is to the same effect. The plaintiff had encompassed a shoal of pilchard by a net with the exception of a small opening, but had not actually secured them when the defendant interfered. Lord Dennan held that the plaintiff had not sufficient possession to maintain trespass, because he \u0026ldquo;could not be said to have had possession of the fish till he had actual power over it.\u0026rdquo;\nThe same rule prevails in the whale fishery. It has been established by various decisions from the year 1788 to 1827, that \u0026ldquo;the fish is the property of the first striker only so long as it continues under his power and management, and when the first striker loses his power and management over it, it becomes what is termed a loose fish and is the property of the person who afterwards secures it.\u0026quot;—Littledale v. Scarth. 1 Taun; Hogarth v. Jackson, 2 C. \u0026amp; P.\nI cannot find in any of the whale cases a decision, or even an obiter dictum, that the mere killing the fish without the ability to get it into actual possession and power vests absolute property in the killer.\nIt has been argued that the seal being dead cannot \u0026ldquo;escape,\u0026rdquo; and that such word must relate to a living animal. That may be grammatically true, but is it really a fact? Of course it cannot actively paddle away, but may it not passively be floated away? And what practical difference does it make whether the seal is lost by its own action, or by the action of the ice on which it floats? The substantial fact being that whether actively or passively the animal is lost to the man who killed it.\nThe pernicious consequences to the trade likely to follow from this new interpretation, and the prolific source of litigation it will prove, have been well depicted by Mr. Pinsent; but perhaps such inconveniences are subject rather for the consideration of the Legislature than of the judges, who must administer the law irrespective of consequences.\nThe grave question here is, what is the law? Is it what the Supreme Court has for the last forty years uniformly and unanimously declared, or is it what the Supreme Court of today by a majority of its judges declare, in opposition to the former ruling? And in the next case that shall arise, which ruling is to prevail?\nSuch uncertainty in relation to one of the staple trades of the colony cannot it seems be a voided, nevertheless it is to be regretted; for my part I feel it to be wise and safe \u0026ldquo;to stand upon the ancient ways,\u0026rdquo; which in the present instance I believe to be also the legal ways, and in my opinion the rule should be made absolute on the grounds to which I have adverted.\n"},{"id":45,"href":"/casebook/title/","title":"Chapter 3","section":"The Normal Casebook","content":"This is the third chapter, focused on the basic nature of title and its transfer over time.\nThe private/public theme comes through in the move from estates and qualified transfers to title registration\nTitle (Estates) # This section is about title.\nBasic Estates and Future Interests Introduction to the basic common law estates in land and the concept of future interests.\nConveyancing Act A statue establishing parameters for the transfer of land title in Nova Scotia.\nRe Walker Interpretation of a will addressing the type of common law estate conveyed.\nStuartburn (Municipality) v Kiansky Addressing the question of what forms of interest in land qualify as \u0026#34;ownership\u0026#34; in the context of municipal electoral legislation.\nTenure and Estates Brief background to the common law doctrines of tenues and estates in land.\nWills Act A statue addressing the transfer of land title by bequest in Nova Scotia.\nAboriginal Title # Constitution Act, 1982 Delgamuukw v British Columbia Duty to Consult Guerin v R Overview - The St. Catherine\u0026#39;s Milling Case Background to St. Catherine\u0026#39;s Milling\nRoyal Proclamation (1763) Issued by King George III in 1763 following the Treaty of Paris, by which Britain acquired control over French territories in North America.\nSouthwind v Canada St. Catherine\u0026#39;s Milling and Lumber Co. v R Tsilhqot’in Nation v.

(majority) \u0026ndash; # This cause comes before us on a return to a certiorari directed to one of the justices of Queens county.\nThe question submitted by the counsel in this cause for our determination is, whether Lodowick Post, by the pursuit with his hounds in the manner alleged in his declaration, acquired such a right to, or property in, the fox, as will sustain an action against Pierson for killing and taking him away?\nThe cause was argued with much ability by the counsel on both sides, and presents for our decision a novel and nice question. It is admitted that a fox is an animal feræ naturæ, and that property in such animals is acquired by occupancy only. These admissions narrow the discussion to the simple question of what acts amount to occupancy, applied to acquiring right to wild animals?\nIf we have recourse to the ancient writers upon general principles of law, the judgment below is obviously erroneous. Justinian's Institutes, lib. 2. tit. 1. s. 13. and Fleta, lib. 3. c. 2. p. 175. adopt the principle, that pursuit alone vests no property or right in the huntsman; and that even pursuit, accompanied with wounding, is equally ineffectual for that purpose, unless the animal be actually taken. The same principle is recognised by Bracton, lib. 2. c. 1. p. 8.\nPuffendorf, lib. 4. c. 6. s. 2. and 10. defines occupancy of beasts feræ naturæ, to be the actual corporal possession of them, and Bynkershoek is cited as coinciding in this definition. It is indeed with hesitation that Puffendorf affirms that a wild beast mortally wounded, or greatly maimed, cannot be fairly intercepted by another, whilst the pursuit of the person inflicting the wound continues. The foregoing authorities are decisive to show that mere pursuit gave Post no legal right to the fox, but that he became the property of Pierson, who intercepted and killed him.\nIt therefore only remains to inquire whether there are any contrary principles, or authorities, to be found in other books, which ought to induce a different decision. Most of the cases which have occurred in England, relating to property in wild animals, have either been discussed and decided upon the principles of their positive statute regulations, or have arisen between the huntsman and the owner of the land upon which beasts feræ naturæ have been apprehended; the former claiming them by title of occupancy, and the latter ratione soli. Little satisfactory aid can, therefore, be derived from the English reporters.\nBarbeyrac, in his notes on Puffendorf, does not accede to the definition of occupancy by the latter, but, on the contrary, affirms, that actual bodily seizure is not, in all cases, necessary to constitute possession of wild animals. He does not, however, describe the acts which, according to his ideas, will amount to an appropriation of such animals to private use, so as to exclude the claims of all other persons, by title of occupancy, to the same animals; and he is far from averring that pursuit alone is sufficient for that purpose. To a certain extent, and as far as Barbeyrac appears to me to go, his objections to Puffendorf's definition of occupancy are reasonable and correct. That is to say, that actual bodily seizure is not indispensable to acquire right to, or possession of, wild beasts; but that, on the contrary, the mortal wounding of such beasts, by one not abandoning his pursuit, may, with the utmost propriety, be deemed possession of him; since, thereby, the pursuer manifests an unequivocal intention of appropriating the animal to his individual use, has deprived him of his natural liberty, and brought him within his certain control. So also, encompassing and securing such animals with nets and toils, or otherwise intercepting them in such a manner as to deprive them of their natural liberty, and render escape impossible, may justly be deemed to give possession of them to those persons who, by their industry and labour, have used such means of apprehending them. Barbeyrac seems to have adopted, and had in view in his notes, the more accurate opinion of Grotius, with respect to occupancy. That celebrated author, lib. 2. c. 8. s. 3. p. 309. speaking of occupancy, proceeds thus: \u0026quot;Requiritur autem corporalis quædam possessio ad dominium adipiscendum; atque ideo, vulnerasse non sufficit.\u0026quot; But in the following section he explains and qualifies this definition of occupancy: \u0026quot;Sed possessio illa potest non solis manibus, sed instrumentis, ut decipulis, retibus, laqueis dum duo adsint: primum ut ipsa instrumenta sint in nostra potestate, deinde ut fera, ita inclusa sit, ut exire inde nequeat.\u0026quot; This qualification embraces the full extent of Barbeyrac's objection to Puffendorf's definition, and allows as great a latitude to acquiring property by occupancy, as can reasonably be inferred from the words or ideas expressed by Barbeyrac in his notes. The case now under consideration is one of mere pursuit, and presents no circumstances or acts which can bring it within the definition of occupancy by Puffendorf, or Grotius, or the ideas of Barbeyrac upon that subject.\nThe case cited from 11 Mod. 74\u0026mdash;130. I think clearly distinguishable from the present; inasmuch as there the action was for maliciously hindering and disturbing the plaintiff in the exercise and enjoyment of a private franchise; and in the report of the same case, 3 Salk. 9. Holt, Ch. J. states, that the ducks were in the plaintiff's decoy pond, and so in his possession, from which it is obvious the court laid much stress in their opinion upon the plaintiff's possession of the ducks, ratione soli.\nWe are the more readily inclined to confine possession or occupancy of beasts feræ naturæ, within the limits prescribed by the learned authors above cited, for the sake of certainty, and preserving peace and order in society. If the first seeing, starting, or pursuing such animals, without having so wounded, circumvented or ensnared them, so as to deprive them of their natural liberty, and subject them to the control of their pursuer, should afford the basis of actions against others for intercepting and killing them, it would prove a fertile source of quarrels and litigation.\nHowever uncourteous or unkind the conduct of Pierson towards Post, in this instance, may have been, yet his act was productive of no injury or damage for which a legal remedy can be applied. We are of opinion the judgment below was erroneous, and ought to be reversed.\nLivingston J. \u0026ndash; # My opinion differs from that of the court.\nOf six exceptions, taken to the proceedings below, all are abandoned except the third, which reduces the controversy to a single question.\nWhether a person who, with his own hounds, starts and hunts a fox on waste and uninhabited ground, and is on the point of seizing his prey, acquires such an interest in the animal, as to have a right of action against another, who in view of the huntsman and his dogs in full pursuit, and with knowledge of the chase, shall kill and carry him away?\nThis is a knotty point, and should have been submitted to the arbitration of sportsmen, without poring over Justinian, Fleta, Bracton, Puffendorf, Locke, Barbeyrac, or Blackstone, all of whom have been cited; they would have had no difficulty in coming to a prompt and correct conclusion. In a court thus constituted, the skin and carcass of poor reynard would have been properly disposed of, and a precedent set, interfering with no usage or custom which the experience of ages has sanctioned, and which must be so well known to every votary of Diana. But the parties have referred the question to our judgment, and we must dispose of it as well as we can, from the partial lights we possess, leaving to a higher tribunal, the correction of any mistake which we may be so unfortunate as to make. By the pleadings it is admitted that a fox is a \u0026quot;wild and noxious beast.\u0026quot; Both parties have regarded him, as the law of nations does a pirate, \u0026quot;hostem humani generis,\u0026quot; and although \u0026quot;de mortuis nil nisi bonum,\u0026quot; be a maxim of our profession, the memory of the deceased has not been spared. His depredations on farmers and on barn yards, have not been forgotten; and to put him to death wherever found, is allowed to be meritorious, and of public benefit. Hence it follows, that our decision should have in view the greatest possible encouragement to the destruction of an animal, so cunning and ruthless in his career. But who would keep a pack of hounds; or what gentleman, at the sound of the horn, and at peep of day, would mount his steed, and for hours together, \u0026quot;sub jove frigido,\u0026quot; or a vertical sun, pursue the windings of this wily quadruped, if, just as night came on, and his stratagems and strength were nearly exhausted, a saucy intruder, who had not shared in the honours or labours of the chase, were permitted to come in at the death, and bear away in triumph the object of pursuit? Whatever Justinian may have thought of the matter, it must be recollected that his code was compiled many hundred years ago, and it would be very hard indeed, at the distance of so many centuries, not to have a right to establish a rule for ourselves. In his day, we read of no order of men who made it a business, in the language of the declaration in this cause, \u0026quot;with hounds and dogs to find, start, pursue, hunt, and chase,\u0026quot; these animals, and that, too, without any other motive than the preservation of Roman poultry; if this diversion had been then in fashion, the lawyers who composed his institutes, would have taken care not to pass it by, without suitable encouragement. If any thing, therefore, in the digests or pandects shall appear to militate against the defendant in error, who, on this occasion, was the foxhunter, we have only to say tempora mutantur; and if men themselves change with the times, why should not laws also undergo an alteration?\nIt may be expected, however, by the learned counsel, that more particular notice be taken of their authorities. I have examined them all, and feel great difficulty in determining, whether to acquire dominion over a thing, before in common, it be sufficient that we barely see it, or know where it is, or wish for it, or make a declaration of our will respecting it; or whether, in the case of wild beasts, setting a trap, or lying in wait, or starting, or pursuing, be enough; or if an actual wounding, or killing, or bodily tact and occupation be necessary. Writers on general law, who have favoured us with their speculations on these points, differ on them all; but, great as is the diversity of sentiment among them, some conclusion must be adopted on the question immediately before us. After mature deliberation, I embrace that of Barbeyrac, as the most rational, and least liable to objection. If at liberty, we might imitate the courtesy of a certain emperor, who, to avoid giving offence to the advocates of any of these different doctrines, adopted a middle course, and by ingenious distinctions, rendered it difficult to say (as often happens after a fierce and angry contest) to whom the palm of victory belonged. He ordained, that if a beast be followed with large dogs and hounds, he shall belong to the hunter, not to the chance occupant; and in like manner, if he be killed or wounded with a lance or sword; but if chased with beagles only, then he passed to the captor, not to the first pursuer. If slain with a dart, a sling, or a bow, he fell to the hunter, if still in chase, and not to him who might afterwards find and seize him.\nNow, as we are without any municipal regulations of our own, and the pursuit here, for aught that appears on the case, being with dogs and hounds of imperial stature, we are at liberty to adopt one of the provisions just cited, which comports also with the learned conclusion of Barbeyrac, that property in animals feræ naturæ may be acquired without bodily touch or manucaption, provided the pursuer be within reach, or have a reasonable prospect (which certainly existed here) of taking, what he has thus discovered an intention of converting to his own use.\nWhen we reflect also that the interest of our husbandmen, the most useful of men in any community, will be advanced by the destruction of a beast so pernicious and incorrigible, we cannot greatly err, in saying, that a pursuit like the present, through waste and unoccupied lands, and which must inevitably and speedily have terminated in corporal possession, or bodily seisin, confers such a right to the object of it, as to make any one a wrongdoer, who shall interfere and shoulder the spoil. The justice's judgment ought, therefore, in my opinion, to be affirmed.\nJudgment of reversal.\n"},{"id":48,"href":"/casebook/relationships/popov/","title":"Popov v Hayashi","section":"Chapter 1","content":" McCarthy J. — # Facts # In 1927, Babe Ruth hit sixty home runs. That record stood for thirty four years until Roger Maris broke it in 1961 with sixty one home runs. Mark McGwire hit seventy in 1998. On October 7, 2001, at PacBell Park in San Francisco, Barry Bonds hit number seventy three. That accomplishment set a record which, in all probability, will remain unbroken for years into the future.\nThe event was widely anticipated and received a great deal of attention.\nThe ball that found itself at the receiving end of Mr. Bond’s bat garnered some of that attention. Baseball fans in general, and especially people at the game, understood the importance of the ball. It was worth a great deal of money and whoever caught it would bask, for a brief period of time, in the reflected fame of Mr. Bonds.\nWith that in mind, many people who attended the game came prepared for the possibility that a record setting ball would be hit in their direction. Among this group were plaintiff Alex Popov and defendant Patrick Hayashi. They were unacquainted at the time. Both men brought baseball gloves, which they anticipated using if the ball came within their reach.\nThey, along with a number of others, positioned themselves in the arcade section of the ballpark. This is a standing room only area located near right field. It is in this general area that Barry Bonds hits the greatest number of home runs.2 The area was crowded with people on October 7, 2001 and access was restricted to those who held tickets for that section.\nBarry Bonds came to bat in the first inning. With nobody on base and a full count, Bonds swung at a slow knuckleball. He connected. The ball sailed over the right-field fence and into the arcade.\nJosh Keppel, a cameraman who was positioned in the arcade, captured the event on videotape. Keppel filmed much of what occurred from the time Bonds hit the ball until the commotion in the arcade had subsided. He was standing very near the spot where the ball landed and he recorded a significant amount of information critical to the disposition of this case.\nIn addition to the Keppel tape, seventeen percipient witnesses testified as to what they saw after the ball came into the stands. The testimony of these witnesses varied on many important points. Some of the witnesses had a good vantage point and some did not. Some appeared disinterested in the outcome of the litigation and others had a clear bias. Some remembered the events well and others did not. Some were encumbered by prior inconsistent statements which diminished their credibility.\nThe factual findings in this case are the result of an analysis of the testimony of all the witnesses as well as a detailed review of the Keppel tape. Those findings are as follows:\nWhen the seventy-third home run ball went into the arcade, it landed in the upper portion of the webbing of a softball glove worn by Alex Popov. While the glove stopped the trajectory of the ball, it is not at all clear that the ball was secure. Popov had to reach for the ball and in doing so, may have lost his balance.\nEven as the ball was going into his glove, a crowd of people began to engulf Mr. Popov. He was tackled and thrown to the ground while still in the process of attempting to complete the catch. Some people intentionally descended on him for the purpose of taking the ball away, while others were involuntarily forced to the ground by the momentum of the crowd.\nEventually, Mr. Popov was buried face down on the ground under several layers of people. At one point he had trouble breathing. Mr. Popov was grabbed, hit and kicked. People reached underneath him in the area of his glove. Neither the tape nor the testimony is sufficient to establish which individual members of the crowd were responsible for the assaults on Mr. Popov.\nThe videotape clearly establishes that this was an out of control mob, engaged in violent, illegal behavior. Although some witnesses testified in a manner inconsistent with this finding, their testimony is specifically rejected as being false on a material point.\nMr. Popov intended at all times to establish and maintain possession of the ball. At some point the ball left his glove and ended up on the ground. It is impossible to establish the exact point in time that this occurred or what caused it to occur.\nMr. Hayashi was standing near Mr. Popov when the ball came into the stands. He, like Mr. Popov, was involuntarily forced to the ground. He committed no wrongful act. While on the ground he saw the loose ball. He picked it up, rose to his feet and put it in his pocket.\nAlthough the crowd was still on top of Mr. Popov, security guards had begun the process of physically pulling people off. Some people resisted those efforts. One person argued with an official and another had to be pulled off by his hair.\nMr. Hayashi kept the ball hidden. He asked Mr. Keppel to point the camera at him. At first, Mr. Keppel did not comply and Mr. Hayashi continued to hide the ball. Finally after someone else in the crowd asked Mr. Keppel to point the camera at Mr. Hayashi, Mr. Keppel complied. It was only at that point that Mr. Hayashi held the ball in the air for others to see. Someone made a motion for the ball and Mr. Hayashi put it back in his glove. It is clear that Mr. Hayashi was concerned that someone would take the ball away from him and that he was unwilling to show it until he was on videotape. Although he testified to the contrary, that portion of his testimony is unconvincing.\nMr. Popov eventually got up from the ground. He made several statements while he was on the ground and shortly after he got up which are consistent with his claim that he had achieved some level of control over the ball and that he intended to keep it. Those statements can be heard on the audio portion of the tape. When he saw that Mr. Hayashi had the ball he expressed relief and grabbed for it. Mr. Hayashi pulled the ball away. Security guards then took Mr. Hayashi to a secure area of the stadium.\nIt is important to point out what the evidence did not and could not show. Neither the camera nor the percipient witnesses were able to establish whether Mr. Popov retained control of the ball as he descended into the crowd. Mr. Popov’s testimony on this question is inconsistent on several important points, ambiguous on others and, on the whole, unconvincing. We do not know when or how Mr. Popov lost the ball.\nPerhaps the most critical factual finding of all is one that cannot be made. We will never know if Mr. Popov would have been able to retain control of the ball had the crowd not interfered with his efforts to do so. Resolution of that question is the work of a psychic, not a judge.\nLegal Analysis # Plaintiff has pled causes of actions for conversion, trespass to chattel, injunctive relief and constructive trust.\nConversion is the wrongful exercise of dominion over the personal property of another. There must be actual interference with the plaintiff’s dominion. Wrongful withholding of property can constitute actual interference even where the defendant lawfully acquired the property. If a person entitled to possession of personal property demands its return, the unjustified refusal to give the property back is conversion.\nThe act constituting conversion must be intentionally done. There is no requirement, however, that the defendant know that the property belongs to another or that the defendant intends to dispossess the true owner of its use and enjoyment. Wrongful purpose is not a component of conversion.\nThe injured party may elect to seek either specific recovery of the property or monetary damages.\nTrespass to chattel, in contrast, exists where personal property has been damaged or where the defendant has interfered with the plaintiff’s use of the property. Actual dispossession is not an element of the tort of trespass to chattel.\nIn the case at bar, Mr. Popov is not claiming that Mr. Hayashi damaged the ball or that he interfered with Mr. Popov’s use and enjoyment of the ball. He claims instead that Mr. Hayashi intentionally took it from him and refused to give it back. There is no trespass to chattel. If there was a wrong at all, it is conversion.\nConversion does not exist, however, unless the baseball rightfully belongs to Mr. Popov. One who has neither title nor possession, nor any right to possession, cannot sue for conversion. The deciding question in this case then, is whether Mr. Popov achieved possession or the right to possession as he attempted to catch and hold on to the ball.\nThe parties have agreed to a starting point for the legal analysis. Prior to the time the ball was hit, it was possessed and owned by Major League Baseball. At the time it was hit it became intentionally abandoned property. The first person who came in possession of the ball became its new owner.\nThe parties fundamentally disagree about the definition of possession. In order to assist the court in resolving this disagreement, four distinguished law professors participated in a forum to discuss the legal definition of possession. The professors also disagreed.\nThe disagreement is understandable. Although the term possession appears repeatedly throughout the law, its definition varies depending on the context in which it is used. Various courts have condemned the term as vague and meaningless.\nThis level of criticism is probably unwarranted.\nWhile there is a degree of ambiguity built into the term possession, that ambiguity exists for a purpose. Courts are often called upon to resolve conflicting claims of possession in the context of commercial disputes. A stable economic environment requires rules of conduct which are understandable and consistent with the fundamental customs and practices of the industry they regulate. Without that, rules will be difficult to enforce and economic instability will result. Because each industry has different customs and practices, a single definition of possession cannot be applied to different industries without creating havoc.\nThis does not mean that there are no central principles governing the law of possession. It is possible to identify certain fundamental concepts that are common to every definition of possession.\nProfessor Roger Bernhardt has recognized that “[p]ossession requires both physical control over the item and an intent to control it or exclude others from it. But these generalizations function more as guidelines than as direct determinants of possession issues. Possession is a blurred question of law and fact.”\nProfessor Brown argues that “[t]he orthodox view of possession regards it as a union of the two elements of the physical relation of the possessor to the thing, and of intent. This physical relation is the actual power over the thing in question, the ability to hold and make use of it. But a mere physical relation of the possessor to the thing in question is not enough. There must also be manifested an intent to control it.”\nThe task of this court is to use these principles as a starting point to craft a definition of possession that applies to the unique circumstances of this case.\nWe start with the observation that possession is a process which culminates in an event. The event is the moment in time that possession is achieved. The process includes the acts and thoughts of the would be possessor which lead up to the moment of possession.\nThe focus of the analysis in this case is not on the thoughts or intent of the actor. Mr. Popov has clearly evidenced an intent to possess the baseball and has communicated that intent to the world. The question is whether he did enough to reduce the reduce the ball to his exclusive dominion and control. Were his acts sufficient to create a legally cognizable interest in the ball?\nMr. Hayashi argues that possession does not occur until the fan has complete control of the ball. Professor Brian Gray, suggests the following definition “A person who catches a baseball that enters the stands is its owner. A ball is caught if the person has achieved complete control of the ball at the point in time that the momentum of the ball and the momentum of the fan while attempting to catch the ball ceases. A baseball, which is dislodged by incidental contact with an inanimate object or another person, before momentum has ceased, is not possessed. Incidental contact with another person is contact that is not intended by the other person. The first person to pick up a loose ball and secure it becomes its possessor.”\nMr. Popov argues that this definition requires that a person seeking to establish possession must show unequivocal dominion and control, a standard rejected by several leading cases. Instead, he offers the perspectives of Professor Bernhardt and Professor Paul Finkelman who suggest that possession occurs when an individual intends to take control of a ball and manifests that intent by stopping the forward momentum of the ball whether or not complete control is achieved.\nProfessors Finkelman and Bernhardt have correctly pointed out that some cases recognize possession even before absolute dominion and control is achieved. Those cases require the actor to be actively and ably engaged in efforts to establish complete control. Moreover, such efforts must be significant and they must be reasonably calculated to result in unequivocal dominion and control at some point in the near future.\nThis rule is applied in cases involving the hunting or fishing of wild animals or the salvage of sunken vessels. The hunting and fishing cases recognize that a mortally wounded animal may run for a distance before falling. The hunter acquires possession upon the act of wounding the animal not the eventual capture. Similarly, whalers acquire possession by landing a harpoon, not by subduing the animal.\nIn the salvage cases, an individual may take possession of a wreck by exerting as much control “as its nature and situation permit”. Inadequate efforts, however, will not support a claim of possession. Thus, a “sailor cannot assert a claim merely by boarding a vessel and publishing a notice, unless such acts are coupled with a then present intention of conducting salvage operations, and he immediately thereafter proceeds with activity in the form of constructive steps to aid the distressed party.”\nThese rules are contextual in nature. The are crafted in response to the unique nature of the conduct they seek to regulate. Moreover, they are influenced by the custom and practice of each industry. The reason that absolute dominion and control is not required to establish possession in the cases cited by Mr. Popov is that such a rule would be unworkable and unreasonable. The “nature and situation” of the property at issue does not immediately lend itself to unequivocal dominion and control. It is impossible to wrap ones arms around a whale, a fleeing fox or a sunken ship.\nThe opposite is true of a baseball hit into the stands of a stadium. Not only is it physically possible for a person to acquire unequivocal dominion and control of an abandoned baseball, but fans generally expect a claimant to have accomplished as much. The custom and practice of the stands creates a reasonable expectation that a person will achieve full control of a ball before claiming possession. There is no reason for the legal rule to be inconsistent with that expectation. Therefore Gray’s Rule is adopted as the definition of possession in this case.\nThe central tenant of Gray’s Rule is that the actor must retain control of the ball after incidental contact with people and things. Mr. Popov has not established by a preponderance of the evidence that he would have retained control of the ball after all momentum ceased and after any incidental contact with people or objects. Consequently, he did not achieve full possession.\nThat finding, however, does not resolve the case. The reason we do not know whether Mr. Popov would have retained control of the ball is not because of incidental contact. It is because he was attacked. His efforts to establish possession were interrupted by the collective assault of a band of wrongdoers.\nA decision which ignored that fact would endorse the actions of the crowd by not repudiating them. Judicial rulings, particularly in cases that receive media attention, affect the way people conduct themselves. This case demands vindication of an important principle. We are a nation governed by law, not by brute force.\nAs a matter of fundamental fairness, Mr. Popov should have had the opportunity to try to complete his catch unimpeded by unlawful activity. To hold otherwise would be to allow the result in this case to be dictated by violence. That will not happen.\nFor these reasons, the analysis cannot stop with the valid observation that Mr. Popov has not proved full possession.\nThe legal question presented at this point is whether an action for conversion can proceed where the plaintiff has failed to establish possession or title. It can. An action for conversion may be brought where the plaintiff has title, possession or the right to possession.\nHere Mr. Popov seeks, in effect, a declaratory judgment that he has either possession or the right to possession. In addition he seeks the remedies of injunctive relief and a constructive trust. These are all actions in equity. A court sitting in equity has the authority to fashion rules and remedies designed to achieve fundamental fairness.\nConsistent with this principle, the court adopts the following rule. Where an actor undertakes significant but incomplete steps to achieve possession of a piece of abandoned personal property and the effort is interrupted by the unlawful acts of others, the actor has a legally cognizable pre-possessory interest in the property. That pre-possessory interest constitutes a qualified right to possession which can support a cause of action for conversion.\nPossession can be likened to a journey down a path. Mr. Popov began his journey unimpeded. He was fast approaching a fork in the road. A turn in one direction would lead to possession of the ball ––– he would complete the catch. A turn in the other direction would result in a failure to achieve possession ––– he would drop the ball. Our problem is that before Mr. Popov got to the point where the road forked, he was set upon by a gang of bandits, who dislodged the ball from his grasp.\nRecognition of a legally protected pre-possessory interest, vests Mr. Popov with a qualified right to possession and enables him to advance a legitimate claim to the baseball based on a conversion theory. Moreover it addresses the harm done by the unlawful actions of the crowd.\nIt does not, however, address the interests of Mr. Hayashi. The court is required to balance the interests of all parties.\nMr. Hayashi was not a wrongdoer. He was a victim of the same bandits that attacked Mr. Popov. The difference is that he was able to extract himself from their assault and move to the side of the road. It was there that he discovered the loose ball. When he picked up and put it in his pocket he attained unequivocal dominion and control.\nIf Mr. Popov had achieved complete possession before Mr. Hayashi got the ball, those actions would not have divested Mr. Popov of any rights, nor would they have created any rights to which Mr. Hayashi could lay claim. Mr. Popov, however, was able to establish only a qualified pre-possessory interest in the ball. That interest does not establish a full right to possession that is protected from a subsequent legitimate claim.\nOn the other hand, while Mr. Hayashi appears on the surface to have done everything necessary to claim full possession of the ball, the ball itself is encumbered by the qualified pre-possessory interest of Mr. Popov. At the time Mr. Hayashi came into possession of the ball, it had, in effect, a cloud on its title.\nAn award of the ball to Mr. Popov would be unfair to Mr. Hayashi. It would be premised on the assumption that Mr. Popov would have caught the ball. That assumption is not supported by the facts. An award of the ball to Mr. Hayashi would unfairly penalize Mr. Popov. It would be based on the assumption that Mr. Popov would have dropped the ball. That conclusion is also unsupported by the facts.\nBoth men have a superior claim to the ball as against all the world. Each man has a claim of equal dignity as to the other. We are, therefore, left with something of a dilemma.\nThankfully, there is a middle ground.\nThe concept of equitable division was fully explored in a law review article authored by Professor R.H. Helmholz in the December 1983 edition of the Fordham Law Review. Professor Helmholz addressed the problems associated with rules governing finders of lost and mislaid property. For a variety of reasons not directly relevant to the issues raised in this case, Helmholz suggested employing the equitable remedy of division to resolve competing claims between finders of lost or mislaid property and the owners of land on which the property was found.\nThere is no reason, however, that the same remedy cannot be applied in a case such as this, where issues of property, tort and equity intersect.\nThe concept of equitable division has its roots in ancient Roman law. As Helmholz points out, it is useful in that it “provides an equitable way to resolve competing claims which are equally strong.” Moreover, “[i]t comports with what one instinctively feels to be fair”.\nAlthough there is no California case directly on point, Arnold v. Producers Fruit Company (1900) 128 Cal. 637, 61 P. 283 provides some insight. There, a number of different prune growers contracted with Producer’s Fruit Company to dry and market their product. Producers did a bad job. They mixed fruit from many different growers together in a single bin and much of the fruit rotted because it was improperly treated.\nWhen one of the plaintiffs offered proof that the fruit in general was rotten, Producers objected on the theory that the plaintiff could not prove that the prunes he contributed to the mix were the same prunes that rotted. The court concluded that it did not matter. After the mixing was done, each grower had an undivided interest in the whole, in proportion to the amount of fruit each had originally contributed.\nThe principle at work here is that where more than one party has a valid claim to a single piece of property, the court will recognize an undivided interest in the property in proportion to the strength of the claim.\nApplication of the principle of equitable division is illustrated in the case of Keron v. Cashman (1896) 33 A. 1055. In that case, five boys were walking home along a railroad track in the city of Elizabeth New Jersey. The youngest of the boys came upon an old sock that was tied shut and contained something heavy. He picked it up and swung it. The oldest boy took it away from him and beat the others with it. The sock passes from boy to boy. Each controlled it for a short time. At some point in the course of play, the sock broke open and out spilled $775 as well as some rags, cloths and ribbons.\nThe court noted that possession requires both physical control and the intent to reduce the property to one’s possession. Control and intent must be concurrent. None of the boys intended to take possession until it became apparent that the sock contained money. Each boy had physical control of the sock at some point before that discovery was made.\nBecause none could present a superior claim of concurrent control and intent, the court held that each boy was entitled to an equal share of the money. Their legal claims to the property were of equal quality, therefore their entitlement to the property was also equal.\nHere, the issue is not intent, or concurrence. Both men intended to possess the ball at the time they were in physical contact with it. The issue, instead, is the legal quality of the claim. With respect to that, neither can present a superior argument as against the other.\nMr. Hayashi’s claim is compromised by Mr. Popov’s pre-possessory interest. Mr. Popov cannot demonstrate full control. Albeit for different reasons, they stand before the court in exactly the same legal position as did the five boys. Their legal claims are of equal quality and they are equally entitled to the ball.\nThe court therefore declares that both plaintiff and defendant have an equal and undivided interest in the ball. Plaintiff’s cause of action for conversion is sustained only as to his equal and undivided interest. In order to effectuate this ruling, the ball must be sold and the proceeds divided equally between the parties.\nThe parties are ordered to meet and confer forthwith before Judge Richard Kramer to come to an agreement as to how to implement this decision. If no decision is made by December 30, 2002, the parties are directed to appear before this court on that date at 9:00 am.\nThe court retains jurisdiction to issue orders consistent with this decision. The ball is to remain in the custody of the court until further order.\n"},{"id":49,"href":"/casebook/","title":"The Normal Casebook","section":"About the Casebook","content":"This section contains short explanations or definitions of key concepts used in the course, with links to related material.\n"},{"id":50,"href":"/casebook/other/didow/","title":"Didow","section":"Chapter 6","content":" Haddad J.A. — # The single issue in this appeal is to determine, on the particular facts which follow, whether the respondent has trespassed the air space above the appellants’ land.\nThe material facts are not in dispute.

The distance between the centre of the base of four power poles, each approximately 50 feet in height, to the boundary of the appellants’ land is two feet.

The power line overhangs the east side of the farm yard and we consider it to be unsightly. Since Alberta Power Limited cut down the existing trees under the overhang, we would be reluctant to plant trees in any other area of the overhang. We are also concerned about the danger associated with the lines and the location and operation of tall machinery and equipment such as steel augers or metal granaries under the overhang. In addition, the overhang will restrict the use of aerial spraying and seeding on the land.\nThe learned chambers judge considered a series of authorities and concluded that the protrusion did not interfere with the appellants’ possession of the air space or its right to possession [45 Alta. L.R. (2d) 116, 37 C.C.L.T. 90, 36 L.C.R. 139, 70 A.R. 199]. He applied the following test [pp. 123-24]:\nClearly the question is, is it an interference with possession or even the right to possession?\nHere the applicants do not claim any diminution in their right to full enjoyment of their property. Indeed, the facts are that they are not making use of the air space occupied by the cross-arms and wires and they have no intention of doing so.\nWith respect, that statement does not take into account the problems, actual or potential, referred to in Kenneth W. Didow’s affidavit. Moreover, I have read the relevant authorities and applying the principles and tests I extract therefrom I arrive at a conclusion contrary to that reached by the learned chambers judge. Accordingly, I would allow the appeal.\nThe character of a trespass was not put in controversy. In essence, it is an unjustifiable interference with possession. The appellants are the registered owners of the land below the air space and their status to bring this action is not in dispute.\nA resolution of the issue before the court turns on the extent of the rights acquired by the appellants to the column of air above and within the boundaries of the land.\nThe jurisprudence in this area of the law has developed from early English cases, before the advent of air traffic, where decisions were influenced by the maxim cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad coelum et ad inferos (referred to hereafter as “the Latin maxim”) which in simple language means that the owner of a piece of land owns everything above and below it to an indefinite extent.\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Mini-Lecture: the Ad Coelum Rule \u0026lt;div style=\u0026quot;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/684773265?dnt=0\u0026quot; style=\u0026quot;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;\u0026quot; allow=\u0026quot;fullscreen\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; The authorities cited can, generally speaking, be divided into two groups:\nCases involving permanent structural projections into the air space above another’s land;\nCases involving a transient invasion into the air space above another’s land at a height not likely to interfere with the land owner.\nWith respect to cases in the first group, the weight of authority favours the view that a direct invasion by a permanent artificial projection constitutes a trespass.\nThe appellants, as have all claimants to air space, rely in the main on the Latin maxim. This maxim has been the subject of constant attack in air space litigation over the years and if not discredited has been qualified in its application. Some of the older cases cited by the respondent were aimed at establishing that an overhanging encroachment will have nuisance value only and is therefore not actionable in trespass. This theory is no longer viable, according to recent authority, at least insofar as it applies to structures of a permanent nature.\nThe first of the early decisions cited is Baten’s Case (1610), 9 Co. Rep. 53b, 77 E.R. 810, where a portion of the defendant’s new home was found to overhang part of the plaintiff’s home. Notwithstanding reference to the foregoing maxim the court characterized the overhang as a nuisance. Today, by the application of modern concepts, the overhang, in my view, would be treated as a trespass.\nIn Pickering v. Rudd (1815), 4 Camp. 219, 171 E.R. 70, and Fay v. Prentice (1845), 1 C.B. 828, 135 E.R. 769, it was said that the appropriate remedy in each case was an action in nuisance. Each dealt with projections over an adjoining property.\nIn Pickering, the alleged overhang consisted of a board and Lord Ellenborough did not “think it a trespass to interfere with the air superincumbent on the close”. Caution led him to reject trespass by reasoning that to hold otherwise “an aeronaut is liable to an action in trespass quare clausum fregit, at the suit of the occupier of every field over which his balloon passes in the course of his voyage.” Subsequent judicial pronouncements and existing laws regulating aircraft have now removed Lord Ellenborough’s concern. His decision has been supplanted by more recent authority. (See Kelsen v. Imp. Tobacco Co. (of Great Britain \u0026amp; Ireland), [1957] 2 Q.B. 334, [1957] 2 W.L.R. 1007, [1957] 2 All E.R. 343.)\nThe encroachment of overhanging tree branches litigated in Lemmon v. Webb, [1894] 3 Ch. 1, 10 T.L.R. 467, was also actionable only in nuisance — on sound reasoning. Lindley L.J. found no analogy between an artificial projection and the consequential interference caused by the branch of a tree which could be severed.\nCorbett v. Hill (1870), L.R. 9 Eq. 671, sustained an action in trespass and acknowledged an owner’s right to air space — at least to the vertical column of air over a building.\nThe decision in Wandsworth Bd. of Works v. United Telephone Co. (1884), 13 Q.B.D. 904 (C.A.), although rejecting a plea of trespass on the facts, confirmed a land owner’s rights to air space without explicitly defining the extent of those rights. Telephone wires strung above a street was held not to be a trespass because, by statute, the surface was vested in the board, not as absolute owner, but for the purpose only of maintaining a street. Accordingly, it acquired no right to the air above the street. Their Lordships distinguished between that kind of ownership and that of owners of land vested by ordinary conveyance. The tenor of the three judgments delivered is that absolute ownership of the surface in the board would have created rights to the air space to justify a finding of trespass by the placement of overhead wires. This case has received recognition for the characterization given by Brett M.R. to the Latin maxim as a “fanciful phrase” to diminish its application in a literal sense.\nI come now to cases decided after the turn of the century. In Gifford v. Dent, [1926] W.N. 336, and Kelsen v. Imp. Tobacco Co., supra, the court in each case leaned on the Latin maxim in concluding that an overhanging sign amounted to a trespass of air space.\nMcNair J. in the Kelsen case refused to follow the decision in Pickering v. Rudd. In holding that a trespass had been committed as opposed to a nuisance he adopted the reasoning of cases which followed later in time. He referred, with approval, to both Wandsworth Bd. of Works and Gifford v. Dent. In rejecting Pickering, he thought it significant that in the Civil Aviation Act “the legislature found it necessary expressly to negative the action of trespass or nuisance” arising from an airplane overhead. He interpreted that to mean that the legislature did not share Lord Ellenborough’s view in Pickering. He said “Accordingly, I reach the conclusion that a trespass, and not a mere nuisance, was created by the invasion of the plaintiff’s air space by this sign.”\nThe facts recited by McNair J. disclosed that the presence of the sign in his air space caused the plaintiff no harm or inconvenience and did not diminish his enjoyment. Moreover, His Lordship put no value in the argument that the plaintiff did not require the use of the air space. I particularly mention these facts because the test employed by the learned chambers judge, based on similar circumstances, according to the excerpt from his judgment quoted at the outset of these reasons, led to a verdict adverse to the appellants.\nThe learned chambers judge distinguished Kelsen on the ground that the litigants were tenants within the same building. With respect, that only clouds the issue. As McNair J. discussed and disposed of the defendant’s reliance on the terms of its lease, the ratio of the case did not turn on the tenancies nor was this aspect argued by counsel before this court.\nCounsel for the appellants argues, with some justification, that Kelsen and the case at bar are indistinguishable.\nPlowman J. presided over the case of Ward v. Gold, 211 E.G. 155, [1969] E.G.D. 630, where the offending intrusion consisted of overhanging eaves. There is nothing distinctive about this case except to say that in the opinion of Plowman J. the Kelsen case was in point and he upheld the action taken in trespass.\nThe authorities to which I have referred following Fay v. Prentice, supra, establish that the right to use land includes the right to use and enjoy the air space above the land. These cases cautiously fall short of saying that ownership of land includes ownership of all air space above the land. In any event, they serve to make clear that intrusion by an artificial or permanent structure into the air space of another is forbidden as a trespass.\nCases which fall into the second group involve transient invasion of air space at a height unlikely to affect the landowner. The cases in this group to which the respondent is attracted deal with airplanes. Predicated on sound logic and common sense both case law and statute law now decree that a landowner cannot object to air traffic which does not interfere with the use and enjoyment of his property.\nThe respondent’s strongest submission is that actionable trespass only occurs when the intrusion into air space actually interferes with a landowner’s use and enjoyment of that space. Its submissions follow the statements leading to the decision reached by the chambers judge. The argument is directed to convince the court that a landowner cannot object to an intrusion into air space over his land which he is not actually occupying and using for the time being. Counsel points to public policy principles developed by the courts to permit the use of aircraft in air space and then argues that analogous public policy considerations apply to air space intrusion by overhead electrical installations. As an extension of that argument he says that tens of thousands of miles of transmission lines across Alberta occupy private property.\nThe analogy is hardly appropriate. Aircraft which are transient and invade space at a height beyond the contemplation of reasonable and ordinary use by the landowner cannot be equated with a low level intrusion of a permanent nature. I agree with the opinion stated of Griffiths J. in Lord Bernstein of Leigh v. Skyviews \u0026amp; Gen. Ltd., [1978] A.C. 479, [1977] 3 W.L.R. 136, [1977] 2 All E.R. 902, that low flying aircraft might very well commit a trespass.\nMoreover, if there are many miles of transmission lines already trespassing the air space above private property without any leave or licence, they will not transform an unlawful practice into a lawful one.\nThe respondent cited Lacroix v. R., [1954] Ex. C.R. 69, [1954] 4 D.L.R. 470, to advance the proposition that the landowner’s rights to the air space over his property were limited to what he could possess or occupy. This case arose out of a claim for compensation for an easement to provide lighting for the purposes of aerial navigation of aircraft using the Dorval Airport as well as a claim for damages. It was alleged that the air space over the claimant’s land was used by aircraft as a flightway to and from the airport. Fournier J. referred to the Latin maxim as a maxim not suited to meet the development and invention of today’s world. In its application, its interpretation in his view, has to be restricted without depriving the landowner of full enjoyment of his property — a principle which he endorsed. That portion of his judgment which lends support to the respondent’s position is to be found at pp. 76-77 where he said:\nIt seems to me that the owner of land has a limited right in the air space over his property; it is limited by what he can possess or occupy for the use and enjoyment of his land. By putting up buildings or other constructions the owner does not take possession of the air but unites or incorporates something to the surface of his land. This which is annexed or incorporated to his land becomes part and parcel of the property \u0026hellip;\nI need go only so far as to say that the owner of land is not and cannot be the owner of the unlimited air space over his land, because air and space fall in the cateogry of res omnium communis. For these reasons the suppliant’s claim for damages by reason of the so-called establishment of a flightway over his land fails.\nThe second case which gives the respondent comfort is Air Can. v. R., [1978] 2 W.W.R. 694, 86 D.L.R. (3d) 631, *(*sub nom. Min. of Fin. (Man.) v. Air Can.) [1978] C.T.C. 812 (C.A.), cited to expound the proposition that ownership of air space cannot be claimed by anyone as it falls under the category of omnium communis. This case is distinguishable on the facts as the claim to jurisdiction to air space is made by the province of Manitoba. It unsuccessfully asserted its right to levy a sales tax against Air Canada in respect of goods and services provided by it while occupying air space over the province. Moreover, the case is not founded in trespass. However, the comments of Monnin J.A (now C.J.M.) are relevant and of some significance. After accepting a statement made by the trial judge, which is of no account here, he said at p. 697:\n… I would rather rest the case on the basis that air and airspace are not the subject of ownership by anyone, either state or individual, but fall in the category of res omnium communis.\nLater in his reasons, Mr. Justice Monnin (at p. 699) quoted an extract from the judgment delivered in Lord Bernstein of Leigh v. Skyviews \u0026amp; Gen. Ltd., supra, at p. 907 — in which Griffiths J. qualified the application of the Latin maxim by suggesting “a balance” in compromising the rights of landowners against the general public. Monnin J.A. then added these remarks:\nThe maxim cannot go further than to direct the owner or occupier of land in his enjoyment of the land and also to prevent anyone else from acquiring any title or exclusive right to the space above such land so as to limit a person to whatever proper use he can make of his land.\nAfter giving due consideration to the judgment in Bernstein I find the reasoning of Griffiths J. most persuasive. He reviewed the earlier decisions which found favour with the Latin maxim and the circumstance in each instance in which it was applied. At p. 905 of his reasons, he said:\nThe plaintiff claims that as owner of the land he is also owner of the air space above the land, or at least has the right to exclude any entry into the air space above his land. He relies on the old Latin maxim, cujus est solum ejus est usque ad coelum et ad inferos, a colourful phrase often on the lips of lawyers since it was first coined by Accursius in Bologna in the 13th century. There are a number of cases in which the maxim has been used by English judges but an examination of those cases shows that they have all been concerned with structures attached to the adjoining land, such as overhanging buildings, signs or telegraph wires, and for their solution it has not been necessary for the judge to cast his eyes towards the heavens; he has been concerned with the rights of the owner in the air space immediately adjacent to the surface of the land.\nThat an owner has certain rights in the air space above his land is well established by authority.\nFollowing a reference to Gifford v. Dent Mr. Justice Griffiths discussed the judgment of McNair J. in Kelsen. He quoted the words used by McNair J. in reaching his final conclusion and then made this assessment relevant to that decision at p. 906:\nI very much doubt if in that passage McNair J was intending to hold that the plaintiff’s rights in the air space continued to an unlimited height or “ad coelum” as counsel for the plaintiff submits. The point that the judge was considering was whether the sign was a trespass or a nuisance at the very low level at which it projected. This to my mind is clearly indicated by his reference to Winfield on Tort in which the text reads: “\u0026hellip; it is submitted that trespass will be committed by [aircraft] to the air-space if they fly so low as to come within the area of ordinary user.” The author in that passage is careful to limit the trespass to the height at which it is contemplated an owner might be expected to make use of the air space as a natural incident of the user of his land. If, however, the learned judge was by his reference to the Civil Aviation Act 1949, and his disapproval of the views of Lord Ellenborough in Pickering v. Rudd, indicating the opinion that the flight of an aircraft at whatever height constituted a trespass at common law, I must respectfully disagree.\nI do not wish to cast any doubts on the correctness of the decision on its own particular facts. It may be a sound and practical rule to regard any incursion into the air space at a height which may interfere with the ordinary user of the land as a trespass rather than a nuisance. Adjoining owners then know where they stand; they have no right to erect structures overhanging or passing over their neighbours’ land and there is no room for argument whether they are thereby causing damage or annoyance to their neighbours about which there may be much room for argument and uncertainty. But wholly different considerations arise when considering the passage of aircraft at a height which in no way affects the user of the land.\nGriffiths J. makes a valid distinction between permanent structures which interfere with air space and transient invasions by aircraft to demonstrate that differing considerations apply. At the same time, his remarks convey approval of the decision reached by McNair J. in Kelsen. In my view the approach he pursues is both reasonable and practical. Lord Wilberforce took the opportunity to trace the Latin maxim’s origin and to attack its literal application in Commr. for Ry. v. Valuer-General, [1974] A.C. 328, [1973] 2 W.L.R. 1021, [1973] 3 All E.R. 268, [1972-73] A.L.R. 1209, [1973] 1 N.S.W.L.R. 1 (sub nom. Commr. for Ry. (N.S.W.) v. Wynyard Hldg. Ltd.) (Aus.). The maxim found its way into a dispute regarding the valuation of land for rating purposes. At pp. 351-52 (A.C.) Lord Wilberforce described the maxim as:\nso sweeping, unscientific and unpractical a doctrine is unlikely to appeal to the common law mind. At most the maxim is used as a statement, imprecise enough, of the extent of the rights, prima facie, of owners of land \u0026hellip;\nThe criticism levelled at the Latin maxim by Lord Wilberforce and others no doubt influenced the reasoning of Griffiths J. in Bernstein v. Skyviews. Recognizing that the maxim must be given limited application, Griffiths J. conceived the idea of striking a “balance”.\nThe quotation from the Bernstein case at p. 907, which appears in the reasons delivered by Monnin J.A. in Air Can. provides a reasonable test in determining the rights of a landlord to the air space above his land. He said:\nThe problem is to balance the rights of an owner to enjoy the use of his land against the rights of the general public to take advantage of all that science now offers in the use of air space. This balance is in my judgment best struck in our present society by restricting the rights of an owner in the air space above his land to such height as is necessary for the ordinary use and enjoyment of his land and the structures on it, and declaring that above that height he has no greater rights in the air space than any other member of the public.\nFournier J. in Lacroix limited the landowner’s rights to what he could possess and occupy. Griffiths J. in Skyviews took a broader view by recognizing the landowner’s right to enjoy the use of air space above his land without limitation except as to height. Beyond the height necessary for the landowner’s use, the air space becomes public domain.\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has also considered the landowner’s rights in air space in U.S. v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256, 90 L. Ed. 1206, 66 S. Ct. 1062 (1946). While rejecting the Latin maxim as having no place in the modern world — it preserved the landowner’s rights to this extent at pp. 264-65 which, in my view, is consistent with the views of Griffiths J. in Bernstein v. Skyviews:\nThe landowner owns at least as much of the space above the ground as he can occupy or use in connection with the land \u0026hellip; The fact that he does not occupy it in any physical sense — by the erection of buildings and the like — is not material \u0026hellip; While the owner does not in physical manner occupy that stratum of airspace or make use of it in the conventional sense, he does use it in somewhat the same sense that space left between buildings for the purpose of light and air is used. The superadjacent airspace at this low altitude is so close to the land that continuous invasions of it affect the use of the surface of the land itself. We think that the landowner, as an incident to his ownership, has a claim to it and that invasions of it are in the same category as invasions of the surface.\nThe two concepts which become apparent are firstly that the courts will not give literal effect to the Latin maxim and secondly, the proper remedy for interference with a landowner’s air space with a permanent fixture is in trespass as opposed to nuisance.\nIn my opinion, the balancing criterion formulated by Griffiths J. is a logical compromise to the rights of the landowner and the general public. It is a test I adopt. I view this test as saying a landowner is entitled to freedom from permanent structures which in any way impinge upon the actual or potential use and enjoyment of his land. The cross-arms constitute a low level intrusion which interferes with the appellant’s potential, if not actual, use and enjoyment. This amounts to trespass.\nFor the sole purpose of comment I refer to the cases of Woollerton \u0026amp; Wilson Ltd. v. Richard Costain Ltd., [1970] 1 W.L.R. 411, [1970] 1 All E.R. 483, and Lewvest Ltd. v. Scotia Towers Ltd. (1981), 19 R.P.R. 192, 10 C.E.L.R. 139, 126 D.L.R. 239 (Nfld. T.D.), where, in each instance, it was held that an overhanging crane used in the construction of a building trespassed a landowner’s air space, notwithstanding that the cranes were not permanent intrusions. In light of the distinction now recognized in encroachment cases between nuisance and trespass my inclination would be to characterize the overhanging cranes as a nuisance.\nI would allow the appeal and grant the appellants the declaratory relief sought by them. The appellant are entitled to costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed.\n"},{"id":51,"href":"/casebook/other/moore/","title":"Moore","section":"Chapter 6","content":" Panelli J. — # I. Introduction # We granted review in this case to determine whether plaintiff has stated a cause of action against his physician and other defendants for using his cells in potentially lucrative medical research without his permission. Plaintiff alleges that his physician failed to disclose preexisting research and economic interests in the cells before obtaining consent to the medical procedures by which they were extracted. The superior court sustained all defendants’ demurrers to the third amended complaint, and the Court of Appeal reversed. We hold that the complaint states a cause of action for breach of the physician’s disclosure obligations, but not for conversion.\nII. Facts # Our only task in reviewing a ruling on a demurrer is to determine whether the complaint states a cause of action. Accordingly, we assume that the complaint’s properly pleaded material allegations are true and give the complaint a reasonable interpretation by reading it as a whole and all its parts in their context. We do not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions, or conclusions of fact or law. For these purposes we briefly summarize the pertinent factual allegations of the 50–page complaint.\nThe plaintiff is John Moore (Moore), who underwent treatment for hairy-cell leukemia at the Medical Center of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA Medical Center). The five defendants are: (1) Dr. David W. Golde (Golde), a physician who attended Moore at UCLA Medical Center; (2) the Regents of the University of California (Regents), who own and operate the university; (3) Shirley G. Quan, a researcher employed by the Regents; (4) Genetics Institute, Inc. (Genetics Institute); and (5) Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corporation and related entities (collectively Sandoz).\nMoore first visited UCLA Medical Center on October 5, 1976, shortly after he learned that he had hairy-cell leukemia. After hospitalizing Moore and “withdr[awing] extensive amounts of blood, bone marrow aspirate, and other bodily substances,” Golde confirmed that diagnosis. At this time all 126 defendants, including Golde, were aware that “certain blood products and blood components were of great value in a number of commercial and scientific efforts” and that access to a patient whose blood contained these substances would provide “competitive, commercial, and scientific advantages.”\nOn October 8, 1976, Golde recommended that Moore’s spleen be removed. Golde informed Moore “that he had reason to fear for his life, and that the proposed splenectomy operation \u0026hellip; was necessary to slow down the progress of his disease.” Based upon Golde’s representations, Moore signed a written consent form authorizing the splenectomy.\nBefore the operation, Golde and Quan “formed the intent and made arrangements to obtain portions of [Moore’s] spleen following its removal” and to take them to a separate research unit. Golde gave written instructions to this effect on October 18 and 19, 1976. These research activities “were not intended to have \u0026hellip; any relation to [Moore’s] medical \u0026hellip; care.” However, neither Golde nor Quan informed Moore of their plans to conduct this research or requested his permission. Surgeons at UCLA Medical Center, whom the complaint does not name as defendants, removed Moore’s spleen on October 20, 1976.\nMoore returned to the UCLA Medical Center several times between November 1976 and September 1983. He did so at Golde’s direction and based upon representations “that such visits were necessary and required for his health and well-being, and based upon the trust inherent in and by virtue of the physician-patient relationship\u0026hellip;.” On each of these visits Golde withdrew additional samples of “blood, blood serum, skin, bone marrow aspirate, and sperm.” On each occasion Moore travelled to the UCLA Medical Center from his home in Seattle because he had been told that the procedures were to be performed only there and only under Golde’s direction.\n“In fact, [however,] throughout the period of time that [Moore] was under [Golde’s] care and treatment, \u0026hellip; the defendants were actively involved in a number of activities which they concealed from [Moore]\u0026hellip;.” Specifically, defendants were conducting research on Moore’s cells and planned to “benefit financially and competitively \u0026hellip; [by exploiting the cells] and [their] exclusive access to [the cells] by virtue of [Golde’s] on-going physician-patient relationship\u0026hellip;.”\nSometime before August 1979, Golde established a cell line from Moore’s T-lymphocytes. On January 30, 1981, the Regents applied for a patent on the cell line, listing Golde and Quan as inventors. “[B]y virtue of an established policy \u0026hellip;, [the] Regents, Golde, and Quan would share in any royalties or profits \u0026hellip; arising out of [the] patent.” The patent issued on March 20, 1984, naming Golde and Quan as the inventors of the cell line and the Regents as the assignee of the patent.\nThe Regent’s patent also covers various methods for using the cell line to produce lymphokines. Moore admits in his complaint that “the true clinical potential of each of the lymphokines \u0026hellip; [is] difficult to predict, [but] \u0026hellip; competing commercial firms in these relevant fields have published reports in biotechnology industry periodicals predicting a potential market of approximately $3.01 Billion Dollars by the year 1990 for a whole range of [such lymphokines]\u0026hellip;.”\nWith the Regents’ assistance, Golde negotiated agreements for commercial development of the cell line and products to be derived from it. Under an agreement with Genetics Institute, Golde “became a paid consultant” and “acquired the rights to 75,000 shares of common stock.” Genetics Institute also agreed to pay Golde and the Regents “at least $330,000 over three years, including a pro-rata share of [Golde’s] salary and fringe benefits, in exchange for \u0026hellip; exclusive access to the materials and research performed” on the cell line and products derived from it. On June 4, 1982, Sandoz “was added to the agreement,” and compensation payable to Golde and the Regents was increased by $110,000. “[T]hroughout this period, \u0026hellip; Quan spent as much as 70 [percent] of her time working for [the] Regents on research” related to the cell line.\u0026quot;\nBased upon these allegations, Moore attempted to state 13 causes of action. Each defendant demurred to each purported cause of action. The superior court, however, expressly considered the validity of only the first cause of action, conversion. Reasoning that the remaining causes of action incorporated the earlier, defective allegations, the superior court sustained a general demurrer to the entire complaint with leave to amend. In a subsequent proceeding, the superior court sustained Genetics Institute’s and Sandoz’s demurrers without leave to amend on the grounds that Moore had not stated a cause of action for conversion and that the complaint’s allegations about the entities’ secondary liability were too conclusory. In accordance with its earlier ruling that the defective allegations about conversion rendered the entire complaint insufficient, the superior court took the remaining demurrers off its calendar.\nWith one justice dissenting, the Court of Appeal reversed, holding that the complaint did state a cause of action for conversion. The Court of Appeal agreed with the superior court that the allegations against Genetics Institute and Sandoz were insufficient, but directed the superior court to give Moore leave to amend. The Court of Appeal also directed the superior court to decide “the remaining causes of action, which [had] never been expressly ruled upon.”\nIII. Discussion # A. Breach of Fiduciary Duty and Lack of Informed Consent # The Court first discusses Moore\u0026rsquo;s claim that Dr. Golde breached his fiduciary duty to Moore because the doctor failed to disclose his economic interests in obtaining the cells. So, although Golde obtained Moore\u0026rsquo;s consent to conduct the medical procedures he underwent, he failed to obtain Moore\u0026rsquo;s informed consent. This portion of the judgement is omitted. B. Conversion # Moore also attempts to characterize the invasion of his rights as a conversion—a tort that protects against interference with possessory and ownership interests in personal property. He theorizes that he continued to own his cells following their removal from his body, at least for the purpose of directing their use, and that he never consented to their use in potentially lucrative medical research. Thus, to complete Moore’s argument, defendants’ unauthorized use of his cells constitutes a conversion. As a result of the alleged conversion, Moore claims a proprietary interest in each of the products that any of the defendants might ever create from his cells or the patented cell line.\nNo court, however, has ever in a reported decision imposed conversion liability for the use of human cells in medical research. While that fact does not end our inquiry, it raises a flag of caution. In effect, what Moore is asking us to do is to impose a tort duty on scientists to investigate the consensual pedigree of each human cell sample used in research. To impose such a duty, which would affect medical research of importance to all of society, implicates policy concerns far removed from the traditional, two-party ownership disputes in which the law of conversion arose.Invoking a tort theory originally used to determine whether the loser or the finder of a horse had the better title, Moore claims ownership of the results of socially important medical research, including the genetic code for chemicals that regulate the functions of every human being’s immune system.\nWe have recognized that, when the proposed application of a very general theory of liability in a new context raises important policy concerns, it is especially important to face those concerns and address them openly.

Interactive Data Corp. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 654, 694–700, 254 Cal.Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373 [declining to apply tort remedies for breach of the covenant of good faith in the employment context];Brown v. Superior Court(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1049, 1061–1066, 245 Cal.Rptr. 412, 751 P.2d 470 [declining to apply strict products liability to pharmaceutical manufacturers].) Moreover, we should be hesitant to “impose [new tort duties] when to do so would involve complex policy decisions” (Nally v. Grace Community Church, supra, 47 Cal.3d at p. 299, 253 Cal.Rptr. 97, 763 P.2d 948), especially when such decisions are more appropriately the subject of legislative deliberation and resolution. (See Foley v. Interactive Data Corp., supra, 47 Cal.3d at p. 694 \u0026amp; fn. 31, 254 Cal.Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373.) This certainly is not to say that the applicability of common law torts is limited to the historical or factual contexts of existing cases. But on occasions when we have opened or sanctioned new areas of tort liability, we “have noted that the ‘wrongs and injuries involved were both comprehensible and assessable within the existing judicial framework.’” (Nally v. Grace Community Church, supra, 47 Cal.3d at p. 298, 253 Cal.Rptr. 97, 763 P.2d 948, quoting Peter W. v. San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist. (1976) 60 Cal.App.3d 814, 824, 131 Cal.Rptr. 854.)\nAccordingly, we first consider whether the tort of conversion clearly gives Moore a cause of action under existing law. We do not believe it does. Because of the novelty of Moore’s claim to own the biological materials at issue, to apply the theory of conversion in this context would frankly have to be recognized as an extension of the theory. Therefore, we consider next whether it is advisable to extend the tort to this context.\n(1) Moore’s Claim Under Existing Law # “To establish a conversion, plaintiff must establish an actual interference with his ownership or right of possession…. Where plaintiff neither has title to the property alleged to have been converted, nor possession thereof, he cannot maintain an action for conversion.”(Del E. Webb Corp. v. Structural Materials Co. (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 593, 610–611, 176 Cal.Rptr. 824, emphasis added. See also General Motors A. Corp. v. Dallas (1926) 198 Cal. 365, 370, 245 P. 184.)\nSince Moore clearly did not expect to retain possession of his cells following their removal, to sue for their conversion he must have retained an ownership interest in them. But there are several reasons to doubt that he did retain any such interest. First, no reported judicial decision supports Moore’s claim, either directly or by close analogy. Second, California statutory law drastically limits any continuing interest of a patient in excised cells. Third, the subject matters of the Regents’ patent—the patented cell line and the products derived from it—cannot be Moore’s property.\nNeither the Court of Appeal’s opinion, the parties’ briefs, nor our research discloses a case holding that a person retains a sufficient interest in excised cells to support a cause of action for conversion. We do not find this surprising, since the laws governing such things as human tissues,transplantable organs, blood, fetuses, pituitary glands, corneal tissue, and dead bodies deal with human biological materials as objects sui generis, regulating their disposition to achieve policy goals rather than abandoning them to the general law of personal property. It is these specialized statutes, not the law of conversion, to which courts ordinarily should and do look for guidance on the disposition of human biological materials.\nLacking direct authority for importing the law of conversion into this context, Moore relies, as did the Court of Appeal, primarily on decisions addressing privacy rights. One line of cases involves unwanted publicity. (Lugosi v. Universal Pictures (1979) 25 Cal.3d 813, 160 Cal.Rptr. 323, 603 P.2d 425; Motschenbacher v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (9th Cir.1974) 498 F.2d 821 [interpreting Cal. law].) These opinions hold that every person has a proprietary interest in his own likeness and that unauthorized, business use of a likeness is redressible as a tort. But in neither opinion did the authoring court expressly base its holding on property law. (Lugosi v. Universal Pictures, supra, 25 Cal.3d at pp. 819, 823–826, 160 Cal.Rptr. 323, 603 P.2d 425; Motschenbacher v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, supra, 498 F.2d at pp. 825–826.) Each court stated, following Prosser, that it was “pointless” to debate the proper characterization of the proprietary interest in a likeness. (Motschenbacher v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, supra, 498 F.2d at p. 825, quoting Prosser, Law of Torts (4th ed. 1971) at p. 807; Lugosi v. Universal Pictures, supra, 25 Cal.3d at pp. 819, 824, 160 Cal.Rptr. 323, 603 P.2d 425.) For purposes of determining whether the tort of conversion lies, however, the characterization of the right in question is far from pointless. Only property can be converted.\nNot only are the wrongful-publicity cases irrelevant to the issue of conversion, but the analogy to them seriously misconceives the nature of the genetic materials and research involved in this case. Moore, adopting the analogy originally advanced by the Court of Appeal, argues that “[i]f the courts have found a sufficient proprietary interest in one’s persona, how could one not have a right in one’s own genetic material, something far more profoundly the essence of one’s human uniqueness than a name or a face?” However, as the defendants’ patent makes clear—and the complaint, too, if read with an understanding of the scientific terms which it has borrowed from the patent—the goal and result of defendants’ efforts has been to manufacture lymphokines. Lymphokines, unlike a name or a face, have the same molecular structure in every human being and the same, important functions in every human being’s immune system. Moreover, the particular genetic material which is responsible for the natural production of lymphokines, and which defendants use to manufacture lymphokines in the laboratory, is also the same in every person; it is no more unique to Moore than the number of vertebrae in the spine or the chemical formula of hemoglobin.\nAnother privacy case offered by analogy to support Moore’s claim establishes only that patients have a right to refuse medical treatment. (Bouvia v. Superior Court (1986) 179 Cal.App.3d 1127, 225 Cal.Rptr. 297.) In this context the court in Bouvia wrote that “ ‘[e]very human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body\u0026hellip;.’ ” (Id., at p. 1139, 225 Cal.Rptr. 297, quoting from Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hospital, supra, 211 N.Y. 125, 105 N.E. at p. 93.) Relying on this language to support the proposition that a patient has a continuing right to control the use of excised cells, the Court of Appeal in this case concluded that “[a] patient must have the ultimate power to control what becomes of his or her tissues. To hold otherwise would open the door to a massive invasion of human privacy and dignity in the name of medical progress.” Yet one may earnestly wish to protect privacy and dignity without accepting the extremely problematic conclusion that interference with those interests amounts to a conversion of personal property. Nor is it necessary to force the round pegs of “privacy” and “dignity” into the square hole of “property” in order to protect the patient, since the fiduciary-duty and informed-consent theories protect these interests directly by requiring full disclosure.\nJump to Mosk\u0026rsquo;s Counter-Argument The next consideration that makes Moore’s claim of ownership problematic is California statutory law, which drastically limits a patient’s control over excised cells. Pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 7054.4,“[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, recognizable anatomical parts, human tissues, anatomical human remains, or infectious waste following conclusion of scientific use shall be disposed of by interment, incineration, or any other method determined by the state department [of health services] to protect the public health and safety.” Clearly the Legislature did not specifically intend this statute to resolve the question of whether a patient is entitled to compensation for the nonconsensual use of excised cells. A primary object of the statute is to ensure the safe handling of potentially hazardous biological waste materials. Yet one cannot escape the conclusion that the statute’s practical effect is to limit, drastically, a patient’s control over excised cells. By restricting how excised cells may be used and requiring their eventual destruction, the statute eliminates so many of the rights ordinarily attached to property that one cannot simply assume that what is left amounts to “property” or “ownership” for purposes of conversion law.\nIt may be that some limited right to control the use of excised cells does survive the operation of this statute. There is, for example, no need to read the statute to permit “scientific use” contrary to the patient’s expressed wish. A fully informed patient may always withhold consent to treatment by a physician whose research plans the patient does not approve. That right, however, as already discussed, is protected by the fiduciary-duty and informed-consent theories.\nJump to Mosk\u0026rsquo;s Counter-Argument Finally, the subject matter of the Regents’ patent—the patented cell line and the products derived from it—cannot be Moore’s property. This is because the patented cell line is both factually and legally distinct from the cells taken from Moore’s body.Federal law permits the patenting of organisms that represent the product of “human ingenuity,” but not naturally occurring organisms. (Diamond v. Chakrabarty (1980) 447 U.S. 303, 309–310, 100 S.Ct. 2204, 2208, 65 L.Ed.2d 144.) Human cell lines are patentable because “[l]ong-term adaptation and growth of human tissues and cells in culture is difficult—often considered an art \u0026hellip;,” and the probability of success is low. (OTA Rep., supra, at p. 33; see fn. 2, ante.) It is this inventive effort that patent law rewards, not the discovery of naturally occurring raw materials. Thus, Moore’s allegations that he owns the cell line and the products derived from it are inconsistent with the patent, which constitutes an authoritative determination that the cell line is the product of invention. Since such allegations are nothing more than arguments or conclusions of law, they of course do not bind us. (Daar v. Yellow Cab Co., supra, 67 Cal.2d at p. 713, 63 Cal.Rptr. 724, 433 P.2d 732.)\nJump to Mosk\u0026rsquo;s Counter-Argument (2) Should Conversion Liability Be Extended? # As we have discussed, Moore’s novel claim to own the biological materials at issue in this case is problematic, at best. Accordingly, his attempt to apply the theory of conversion within this context must frankly be recognized as a request to extend that theory. While we do not purport to hold that excised cells can never be property for any purpose whatsoever, the novelty of Moore’s claim demands express consideration of the policies to be served by extending liability (cf. Nally v. Grace Community Church, supra, 47 Cal.3d at pp. 291–300, 253 Cal.Rptr. 97, 763 P.2d 948; Foley v. Interactive Data Corp., supra, 47 Cal.3d at pp. 694–700, 254 Cal.Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373; Brown v. Superior Court, supra, 44 Cal.3d at pp. 1061–1066, 245 Cal.Rptr. 412, 751 P.2d 470) rather than blind deference to a complaint alleging as a legal conclusion the existence of a cause of action.\nThere are three reasons why it is inappropriate to impose liability for conversion based upon the allegations of Moore’s complaint. First, a fair balancing of the relevant policy considerations counsels against extending the tort. Second, problems in this area are better suited to legislative resolution. Third, the tort of conversion is not necessary to protect patients’ rights. For these reasons, we conclude that the use of excised human cells in medical research does not amount to a conversion.\nOf the relevant policy considerations, two are of overriding importance. The first is protection of a competent patient’s right to make autonomous medical decisions. That right, as already discussed, is grounded in well-recognized and long-standing principles of fiduciary duty and informed consent.(See, e.g., Cobbs v. Grant, supra, 8 Cal.3d at pp. 242–246, 104 Cal.Rptr. 505, 502 P.2d 1; Bowman v. McPheeters, supra, 77 Cal.App.2d at p. 800, 176 P.2d 745.)This policy weighs in favor of providing a remedy to patients when physicians act with undisclosed motives that may affect their professional judgment. The second important policy consideration is that we not threaten with disabling civil liability innocent parties who are engaged in socially useful activities, such as researchers who have no reason to believe that their use of a particular cell sample is, or may be, against a donor’s wishes.\nTo reach an appropriate balance of these policy considerations is extremely important. In its report to Congress (see fn. 2, ante), the Office of Technology Assessment emphasized that “[u]ncertainty about how courts will resolve disputes between specimen sources and specimen users could be detrimental to both academic researchers and the infant biotechnology industry, particularly when the rights are asserted long after the specimen was obtained. The assertion of rights by sources would affect not only the researcher who obtained the original specimen, but perhaps other researchers as well.\n“Biological materials are routinely distributed to other researchers for experimental purposes, and scientists who obtain cell lines or other specimen-derived products, such as gene clones, from the original researcher could also be sued under certain legal theories [such as conversion]. Furthermore, the uncertainty could affect product developments as well as research. Since inventions containing human tissues and cells may be patented and licensed for commercial use, companies are unlikely to invest heavily in developing, manufacturing, or marketing a product when uncertainty about clear title exists.” (OTA Rep., supra, at p. 27.)\nIndeed, so significant is the potential obstacle to research stemming from uncertainty about legal title to biological materials that the Office of Technology Assessment reached this striking conclusion: “[R]egardless of the merit of claims by the different interested parties, resolving the current uncertainty may be more important to the future of biotechnology than resolving it in any particular way.” (OTA Rep., supra, at p. 27.)\nWe need not, however, make an arbitrary choice between liability and nonliability. Instead, an examination of the relevant policy considerations suggests an appropriate balance: Liability based upon existing disclosure obligations, rather than an unprecedented extension of the conversion theory, protects patients’ rights of privacy and autonomy without unnecessarily hindering research.\nTo be sure, the threat of liability for conversion might help to enforce patients’ rights indirectly. This is because physicians might be able to avoid liability by obtaining patients’ consent, in the broadest possible terms, to any conceivable subsequent research use of excised cells. Unfortunately, to extend the conversion theory would utterly sacrifice the other goal of protecting innocent parties. Since conversion is a strict liability tort,it would impose liability on all those into whose hands the cells come, whether or not the particular defendant participated in, or knew of, the inadequate disclosures that violated the patient’s right to make an informed decision. In contrast to the conversion theory, the fiduciary-duty and informed-consent theories protect the patient directly, without punishing innocent parties or creating disincentives to the conduct of socially beneficial research.\nResearch on human cells plays a critical role in medical research. This is so because researchers are increasingly able to isolate naturally occurring, medically useful biological substances and to produce useful quantities of such substances through genetic engineering. These efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Products developed through biotechnology that have already been approved for marketing in this country include treatments and tests for leukemia, cancer, diabetes, dwarfism, hepatitis-B, kidney transplant rejection, emphysema, osteoporosis, ulcers, anemia, infertility, and gynecological tumors, to name but a few. (Note, Source Compensation for Tissues and Cells Used in Biotechnical Research: Why a Source Shouldn’t Share in the Profits (1989) 64 Notre Dame L.Rev. 628 \u0026amp; fn. 1 (hereafter Note, Source Compensation); see also OTA Rep., supra, at pp. 58–59.)\nThe extension of conversion law into this area will hinder research by restricting access to the necessary raw materials. Thousands of human cell lines already exist in tissue repositories, such as the American Type Culture Collection and those operated by the National Institutes of Health and the American Cancer Society. These repositories respond to tens of thousands of requests for samples annually. Since the patent office requires the holders of patents on cell lines to make samples available to anyone, many patent holders place their cell lines in repositories to avoid the administrative burden of responding to requests. (OTA Rep., supra, at p. 53.) At present, human cell lines are routinely copied and distributed to other researchers for experimental purposes, usually free of charge.This exchange of scientific materials, which still is relatively free and efficient, will surely be compromised if each cell sample becomes the potential subject matter of a lawsuit. (OTA Rep., supra, at p. 52.)\nTo expand liability by extending conversion law into this area would have a broad impact. The House Committee on Science and Technology of the United States Congress found that “49 percent of the researchers at medical institutions surveyed used human tissues or cells in their research.” Many receive grants from the National Institute of Health for this work. (OTA Rep., supra, at p. 52.) In addition, “there are nearly 350 commercial biotechnology firms in the United States actively engaged in biotechnology research and commercial product development and approximately 25 to 30 percent appear to be engaged in research to develop a human therapeutic or diagnostic reagent\u0026hellip;. Most, but not all, of the human therapeutic products are derived from human tissues and cells, or human cell lines or cloned genes.” (Id., at p. 56.)\nIn deciding whether to create new tort duties we have in the past considered the impact that expanded liability would have on activities that are important to society, such as research. For example, in Brown v. Superior Court, supra, 44 Cal.3d 1049, 245 Cal.Rptr. 412, 751 P.2d 470, the fear that strict product liability would frustrate pharmaceutical research led us to hold that a drug manufacturer’s liability should not be measured by those standards. We wrote that, “[i]f drug manufacturers were subject to strict liability, they might be reluctant to undertake research programs to develop some pharmaceuticals that would prove beneficial or to distribute others that are available to be marketed, because of the fear of large adverse monetary judgments.” (Id., at p. 1063, 245 Cal.Rptr. 412, 751 P.2d 470.)\nAs in Brown, the theory of liability that Moore urges us to endorse threatens to destroy the economic incentive to conduct important medical research. If the use of cells in research is a conversion, then with every cell sample a researcher purchases a ticket in a litigation lottery. Because liability for conversion is predicated on a continuing ownership interest, “companies are unlikely to invest heavily in developing, manufacturing, or marketing a product when uncertainty about clear title exists.” (OTA Rep., supra, at p. 27.) In our view, borrowing again from Brown, “[i]t is not unreasonable to conclude in these circumstances that the imposition of a harsher test for liability would not further the public interest in the development and availability of these important products.” (Brown v. Superior Court, supra, 44 Cal.3d at p. 1065, 245 Cal.Rptr. 412, 751 P.2d 470.)\nIndeed, this is a far more compelling case for limiting the expansion of tort liability than Brown. In Brown, eliminating strict liability made it more difficult for plaintiffs to recover actual damages for serious physical injuries resulting from their mothers’ prenatal use of the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES). (Brown v. Superior Court, supra, 44 Cal.3d at pp. 1054–1055, 245 Cal.Rptr. 412, 751 P.2d 470.) In this case, by comparison, limiting the expansion of liability under a conversion theory will only make it more difficult for Moore to recover a highly theoretical windfall. Any injury to his right to make an informed decision remains actionable through the fiduciary-duty and informed-consent theories.\nJump to Mosk\u0026rsquo;s Counter-Argument If the scientific users of human cells are to be held liable for failing to investigate the consensual pedigree of their raw materials, we believe the Legislature should make that decision. Complex policy choices affecting all society are involved, and “[l]egislatures, in making such policy decisions, have the ability to gather empirical evidence, solicit the advice of experts, and hold hearings at which all interested parties present evidence and express their views\u0026hellip;.” (Foley v. Interactive Data Corp., supra, 47 Cal.3d at p. 694, fn. 31, 254 Cal.Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373.) Legislative competence to act in this area is demonstrated by the existing statutes governing the use and disposition of human biological materials. Legislative interest is demonstrated by the extensive study recently commissioned by the United States Congress. (OTA Rep., supra.) Commentators are also recommending legislative solutions. (See Danforth, Cells, Sales, and Royalties: The Patient’s Right to a Portion of the Profits (1988) 6 Yale L. \u0026amp; Pol’y Rev. 179, 198–201; Note, Source Compensation, supra, 64 Notre Dame L.Rev. at pp. 643–645.)\nJump to Mosk\u0026rsquo;s Counter-Argument Finally, there is no pressing need to impose a judicially created rule of strict liability, since enforcement of physicians’ disclosure obligations will protect patients against the very type of harm with which Moore was threatened. So long as a physician discloses research and economic interests that may affect his judgment, the patient is protected from conflicts of interest. Aware of any conflicts, the patient can make an informed decision to consent to treatment, or to withhold consent and look elsewhere for medical assistance. As already discussed, enforcement of physicians’ disclosure obligations protects patients directly, without hindering the socially useful activities of innocent researchers.\nJump to Mosk\u0026rsquo;s Counter-Argument For these reasons, we hold that the allegations of Moore’s third amended complaint state a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty or lack of informed consent, but not conversion.\nIV. Disposition # The decision of the Court of Appeal is affirmed in part and reversed in part. The case is remanded to the Court of Appeal, which shall direct the superior court to: (1) overrule Golde’s demurrers to the causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and lack of informed consent; (2) sustain, with leave to amend, the demurrers of the Regents, Quan, Sandoz, and Genetics Institute to the purported causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and lack of informed consent; (3) sustain, without leave to amend, all defendants’ demurrers to the purported cause of action for conversion; and (4) hear and determine all defendants’ remaining demurrers.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nMosk J., dissenting — # I dissent.\nContrary to the principal holding of the Court of Appeal, the majority conclude that the complaint does not—in fact cannot—state a cause of action for conversion. I disagree with this conclusion for all the reasons stated by the Court of Appeal, and for additional reasons that I shall explain. For convenience I shall discuss the six premises of the majority’s conclusion in the order in which they appear.\nThe majority first take the position that Moore has no cause of action for conversion under existing law because he retained no “ownership interest” in his cells after they were removed from his body. (Maj. opn., ante, p. 156 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 489 of 793 P.2d.) To state a conversion cause of action a plaintiff must allege his “ownership or right to possession of the property at the time of the conversion” (Baldwin v. Marina City Properties, Inc. (1978) 79 Cal.App.3d 393, 410, 145 Cal.Rptr. 406). Here the complaint defines Moore’s “Blood and Bodily Substances” to include inter alia his blood, his bodily tissues, his cells, and the cell lines derived therefrom. Moore thereafter alleges that “he is the owner of his Blood and Bodily Substances and of the by-products produced therefrom\u0026hellip;.” And he further alleges that such blood and bodily substances “are his tangible personal property, and the activities of the defendants as set forth herein constitute a substantial interference with plaintiff’s possession or right thereto, as well as defendants’ wrongful exercise of dominion over plaintiff’s personal property rights in his Blood and Bodily Substances.”\nThe majority impliedly hold these allegations insufficient as a matter of law, finding three “reasons to doubt” that Moore retained a sufficient ownership interest in his cells, after their excision, to support a conversion cause of action. (Maj. opn., ante, p. 156 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 489 of 793 P.2d.) In my view the majority’s three reasons, taken singly or together, are inadequate to the task.\nThe majority’s first reason is that “no reported judicial decision supports Moore’s claim, either directly or by close analogy.” (Maj. opn., ante, p. 156 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 489 of 793 P.2d.) Neither, however, is there any reported decision rejecting such a claim. The issue is as new as its source—the recent explosive growth in the commercialization of biotechnology.\nThe majority next cite several statutes regulating aspects of the commerce in or disposition of certain parts of the human body, and conclude in effect that in the present case we should also “look for guidance” to the Legislature rather than to the law of conversion. (Id. at p. 156 of 271 Cal.Rptr., at p. 489 of 793 P.2d.) Surely this argument is out of place in an opinion of the highest court of this state. As the majority acknowledge, the law of conversion is a creature of the common law. “The inherent capacity of the common law for growth and change is its most significant feature. Its development has been determined by the social needs of the community which it serves. It is constantly expanding and developing in keeping with advancing civilization and the new conditions and progress of society, and adapting itself to the gradual change of trade, commerce, arts, inventions, and the needs of the country.\u0026quot;\nIn short, as the United States Supreme Court has aptly said, \u0026ldquo;This flexibility and capacity for growth and adaptation is the peculiar boast and excellence of the common law. \u0026hellip; Although the Legislature may of course speak to the subject, in the common law system the primary instruments of this evolution are the courts, adjudicating on a regular basis the rich variety of individual cases brought before them.” (Rodriguez v. Bethlehem Steel Corp. (1974) 12 Cal.3d 382, 394, 115 Cal.Rptr. 765, 525 P.2d 669.)\nEspecially is this true in the field of torts. I need not review the many instances in which this court has broken fresh ground by announcing new rules of tort law: time and again when a new rule was needed we did not stay our hand merely because the matter was one of first impression. For example, in Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories (1980) 26 Cal.3d 588, 163 Cal.Rptr. 132, 607 P.2d 924, we adopted a “market share” theory of liability for injury resulting from administration of a prescription drug and suffered by a plaintiff who without fault cannot trace the particular manufacturer of the drug that caused the harm. Like the opinion in the case at bar, the dissent in Sindell objected that market share liability was “a wholly new theory” and an “unprecedented extension of liability” (id. at pp. 614, 615, 163 Cal.Rptr. 132, 607 P.2d 924), and urged that in view of the economic, social, and medical effects of this new rule the decision to adopt it should rest with the Legislature (id. at p. 621, 163 Cal.Rptr. 132, 607 P.2d 924). We nevertheless declared the new rule for sound policy reasons, explaining that “In our contemporary complex industrialized society, advances in science and technology create fungible goods which may harm consumers and which cannot be traced to any specific producer. The response of the courts can be either to adhere rigidly to prior doctrine, denying recovery to those injured by such products, or to fashion remedies to meet these changing needs.” (Id. at p. 610, 163 Cal.Rptr. 132, 607 P.2d 924.) We took the latter course.\nThe case at bar, of course, does not involve a drug-induced injury. Yet it does present a claim arising, like Sindell’s, from “advances in science and technology” that could not have been foreseen when traditional tort doctrine here, the law of conversion—was formulated. My point is that if the cause of action for conversion is otherwise an appropriate remedy on these facts, we should not refrain from fashioning it simply because another court has not yet so held or because the Legislature has not yet addressed the question. We need not wait on either event, because neither is a precondition to an exercise of our long-standing “power to insure the just and rational development of the common law in our state” (Rodriguez v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., supra, 12 Cal.3d 382, 394, 115 Cal.Rptr. 765, 525 P.2d 669).\nJump to Panelli\u0026rsquo;s Counter-Argument The majority’s second reason for doubting that Moore retained an ownership interest in his cells after their excision is that “California statutory law \u0026hellip; drastically limits a patient’s control over excised cells.” (Maj. opn., ante, p. 158 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 491 of 793 P.2d.) For this proposition the majority rely on Health and Safety Code section 7054.4 (hereafter section 7054.4), set forth in the margin. The majority concede that the statute was not meant to directly resolve the question whether a person in Moore’s position has a cause of action for conversion, but reason that it indirectly resolves the question by limiting the patient’s control over the fate of his excised cells: “By restricting how excised cells may be used and requiring their eventual destruction, the statute eliminates so many of the rights ordinarily attached to property that one cannot simply assume that what is left amounts to ‘property’ or ‘ownership’ for purposes of conversion law.” (Maj. opn., ante, pp. 158–159 of 271 Cal.Rptr., pp. 491–492 of 793 P.2d.) As will appear, I do not believe section 7054.4 supports the just quoted conclusion of the majority.\nFirst, in my view the statute does not authorize the principal use that defendants claim the right to make of Moore’s tissue, i.e., its commercial exploitation. In construing section 7054.4, of course, “we look first to the words of the statute themselves” (Long Beach Police Officers Assn. v. City of Long Beach (1988) 46 Cal.3d 736, 741, 250 Cal.Rptr. 869, 759 P.2d 504), and give those words their usual and ordinary meaning (California Teachers Assn. v. San Diego Community College Dist. (1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 698, 170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856).\nBy its terms, section 7054.4 permits only “scientific use” of excised body parts and tissue before they must be destroyed. We must therefore determine the usual and ordinary meaning of that phrase. I would agree that “scientific use” at least includes routine postoperative examination of excised tissue conducted by a pathologist for diagnostic or prognostic reasons (e.g., to verify preoperative diagnosis or to assist in determining postoperative treatment). I might further agree that “scientific use” could be extended to include purely scientific study of the tissue by a disinterested researcher for the purpose of advancing medical knowledge—provided of course that the patient gave timely and informed consent to that use. It would stretch the English language beyond recognition, however, to say that commercial exploitation of the kind and degree alleged here is also a usual and ordinary meaning of the phrase “scientific use.”\nThe majority dismiss this difficulty by asserting that I read the statute to define “scientific use” as “not-for-profit scientific use,” and by finding “no reason to believe that the Legislature intended to make such a distinction.” (Maj. opn., ante, p. 159, fn. 34 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 492, fn. 34 of 793 P.2d.) The objection misses my point. I do not stress the concept of profit, but the concept of science: the distinction I draw is not between nonprofit scientific use and scientific use that happens to lead to a marketable by-product; it is between a truly scientific use and the blatant commercial exploitation of Moore’s tissue that the present complaint alleges. Under those allegations, defendants Dr. David W. Golde and Shirley G. Quan were not only scientists, they were also full-fledged entrepreneurs: the complaint repeatedly declares that they appropriated Moore’s tissue in order “to further defendants’ independent research and commercial activities and promote their economic, financial and competitive interests.” The complaint also alleges that defendant Regents of the University of California (hereafter Regents) actively assisted the individual defendants in applying for patent rights and in negotiating with bioengineering and pharmaceutical companies to exploit the commercial potential of Moore’s tissue. Finally, the complaint alleges in detail the contractual arrangements between the foregoing defendants and defendants Genetics Institute, Inc., and Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corporation, giving the latter companies exclusive rights to exploit that commercial potential while providing substantial financial benefits to the individual defendants in the form of cash, stock options, consulting fees, and fringe benefits. To exclude such traditionally commercial activities from the phrase “scientific use,” as I do here, does not give it a restrictive definition; rather, it gives the phrase its usual and ordinary meaning, as settled law requires.\nSecondly, even if section 7054.4 does permit defendants’ commercial exploitation of Moore’s tissue under the guise of “scientific use,” it does not follow that—as the majority conclude—the statute “eliminates so many of the rights ordinarily attached to property” that what remains does not amount to “property” or “ownership” for purposes of the law of conversion. (Maj. opn., ante, p. 159 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 492 of 793 P.2d.)\nThe concepts of property and ownership in our law are extremely broad. (See Civ.Code, §§ 654, 655.) A leading decision of this court approved the following definition: “The term \u0026lsquo;property\u0026rsquo; is sufficiently comprehensive to include every species of estate, real and personal, and everything which one person can own and transfer to another. It extends to every species of right and interest capable of being enjoyed as such upon which it is practicable to place a money value.” (Yuba River Power Co. v. Nevada Irr. Dist. (1929) 207 Cal. 521, 523, 279 P. 128.)\nBeing broad, the concept of property is also abstract: rather than referring directly to a material object such as a parcel of land or the tractor that cultivates it, the concept of property is often said to refer to a “bundle of rights” that may be exercised with respect to that object—principally the rights to possess the property, to use the property, to exclude others from the property, and to dispose of the property by sale or by gift. “Ownership is not a single concrete entity but a bundle of rights and privileges as well as of obligations.” (Union Oil Co. v. State Bd. of Equal. (1963) 60 Cal.2d 441, 447, 34 Cal.Rptr. 872, 386 P.2d 496.) But the same bundle of rights does not attach to all forms of property. For a variety of policy reasons, the law limits or even forbids the exercise of certain rights over certain forms of property. For example, both law and contract may limit the right of an owner of real property to use his parcel as he sees fit. Owners of various forms of personal property may likewise be subject to restrictions on the time, place, and manner of their use. Limitations on the disposition of real property, while less common, may also be imposed. Finally, some types of personal property may be sold but not given away, while others may be given away but not sold, and still others may neither be given away nor sold.\nIn each of the foregoing instances, the limitation or prohibition diminishes the bundle of rights that would otherwise attach to the property, yet what remains is still deemed in law to be a protectable property interest. “Since property or title is a complex bundle of rights, duties, powers and immunities, the pruning away of some or a great many of these elements does not entirely destroy the title\u0026hellip;.” (People v. Walker (1939) 33 Cal.App.2d 18, 20, 90 P.2d 854 [even the possessor of contraband has certain property rights in it against anyone other than the state].) The same rule applies to Moore’s interest in his own body tissue: even if we assume that section 7054.4 limited the use and disposition of his excised tissue in the manner claimed by the majority, Moore nevertheless retained valuable rights in that tissue. Above all, at the time of its excision he at least had the right to do with his own tissue whatever the defendants did with it: i.e., he could have contracted with researchers and pharmaceutical companies to develop and exploit the vast commercial potential of his tissue and its products. Defendants certainly believe that their right to do the foregoing is not barred by section 7054.4 and is a significant property right, as they have demonstrated by their deliberate concealment from Moore of the true value of his tissue, their efforts to obtain a patent on the Mo cell line, their contractual agreements to exploit this material, their exclusion of Moore from any participation in the profits, and their vigorous defense of this lawsuit. The Court of Appeal summed up the point by observing that “Defendants’ position that plaintiff cannot own his tissue, but that they can, is fraught with irony.” It is also legally untenable. As noted above, the majority cite no case holding that an individual’s right to develop and exploit the commercial potential of his own tissue is not a right of sufficient worth or dignity to be deemed a protectable property interest. In the absence of such authority—or of legislation to the same effect—the right falls within the traditionally broad concept of property in our law.\nJump to Panelli\u0026rsquo;s Counter-Argument The majority’s third and last reason for their conclusion that Moore has no cause of action for conversion under existing law is that “the subject matter of the Regents’ patent—the patented cell line and the products derived from it—cannot be Moore’s property.” (Maj. opn., ante, p. 159 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 492 of 793 P.2d.) The majority then offer a dual explanation: “This is because the patented cell line is factually and legally distinct from the cells taken from Moore’s body.” (Ibid., italics added.) Neither branch of the explanation withstands analysis.\nFirst, in support of their statement that the Mo cell line is “factually distinct” from Moore’s cells, the majority assert that “Cells change while being developed into a cell line and continue to change over time,” and in particular may acquire an abnormal number of chromosomes. (Maj. opn., ante, p. 159, fn. 35 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 492, fn. 35 of 793 P.2d.) No one disputes these assertions, but they are nonetheless irrelevant. For present purposes no distinction can be drawn between Moore’s cells and the Mo cell line. It appears that the principal reason for establishing a cell line is not to “improve” the quality of the parent cells but simply to extend their life indefinitely, in order to permit long-term study and/or exploitation of the qualities already present in such cells. The complaint alleges that Moore’s cells naturally produced certain valuable proteins in larger than normal quantities; indeed, that was why defendants were eager to culture them in the first place. Defendants do not claim that the cells of the Mo cell line are in any degree more productive of such proteins than were Moore’s own cells. Even if the cells of the Mo cell line in fact have an abnormal number of chromosomes, at the present stage of this case we do not know if that fact has any bearing whatever on their capacity to produce proteins; yet it is in the commercial exploitation of that capacity—not simply in their number of chromosomes—that Moore seeks to assert an interest. For all that appears, therefore, the emphasized fact is a distinction without a difference.\nSecond, the majority assert in effect that Moore cannot have an ownership interest in the Mo cell line because defendants patented it. The majority’s point wholly fails to meet Moore’s claim that he is entitled to compensation for defendants’ unauthorized use of his bodily tissues before defendants patented the Mo cell line: defendants undertook such use immediately after the splenectomy on October 20, 1976, and continued to extract and use Moore’s cells and tissue at least until September 20, 1983; the patent, however, did not issue until March 20, 1984, more than seven years after the unauthorized use began. Whatever the legal consequences of that event, it did not operate retroactively to immunize defendants from accountability for conduct occurring long before the patent was granted.\nNor did the issuance of the patent in 1984 necessarily have the drastic effect that the majority contend. To be sure, the patent granted defendants the exclusive right to make, use, or sell the invention for a period of 17 years.(35 U.S.C. § 154.) But Moore does not assert any such right for himself. Rather, he seeks to show that he is entitled, in fairness and equity, to some share in the profits that defendants have made and will make from their commercial exploitation of the Mo cell line. I do not question that the cell line is primarily the product of defendants’ inventive effort. Yet likewise no one can question Moore’s crucial contribution to the invention—an invention named, ironically, after him: but for the cells of Moore’s body taken by defendants, there would have been no Mo cell line. Thus the complaint alleges that Moore’s “Blood and Bodily Substances were absolutely essential to defendants’ research and commercial activities with regard to his cells, cell lines, [and] the Mo cell-line, \u0026hellip; and that defendants could not have applied for and had issued to them the Mo cell-line patent and other patents described herein without obtaining and culturing specimens of plaintiff’s Blood and Bodily Substances.” Defendants admit this allegation by their demurrers, as well they should: for all their expertise, defendants do not claim they could have extracted the Mo cell line out of thin air.\nNevertheless the majority conclude that the patent somehow cut off all Moore’s rights—past, present, and future—to share in the proceeds of defendants’ commercial exploitation of the cell line derived from his own body tissue. The majority cite no authority for this unfair result, and I cannot believe it is compelled by the general law of patents: a patent is not a license to defraud.Perhaps the answer lies in an analogy to the concept of “joint inventor.” I am aware that “patients and research subjects who contribute cells to research will not be considered inventors.” (OTA Rep., supra, at p. 71.) Nor is such a person strictly speaking a “joint inventor” within the meaning of the term in federal law. (35 U.S.C. § 116.) But he does fall within the spirit of that law:\nThe joint invention provision guarantees that all who contribute in a substantial way to a product’s development benefit from the reward that the product brings. Thus, the protection of joint inventors encourages scientists to cooperate with each other and ensures that each contributor is rewarded fairly.\nAlthough a patient who donates cells does not fit squarely within the definition of a joint inventor, the policy reasons that inform joint inventor patents should also apply to cell donors. Neither John Moore nor any other patient whose cells become the basis for a patentable cell line qualifies as a ‘joint inventor’ because he or she did not further the development of the product in any intellectual or conceptual sense. Nor does the status of patients as sole owners of a component part make them deserving of joint inventorship status. What the patients did do, knowingly or unknowingly, is collaborate with the researchers by donating their body tissue\u0026hellip;. By providing the researchers with unique raw materials, without which the resulting product could not exist, the donors become necessary contributors to the product. Concededly, the patent is not granted for the cell as it is found in nature, but for the modified biogenetic product. However, the uniqueness of the product that gives rise to its patentability stems from the uniqueness of the original cell. A patient’s claim to share in the profits flowing from a patent would be analogous to that of an inventor whose collaboration was essential to the success of a resulting product. The patient was not a coequal, but was a necessary contributor to the cell line. (Danforth, Cells, Sales, \u0026amp; Royalties: The Patient’s Right to a Portion of the Profits (1988) 6 Yale L. \u0026amp; Pol’y Rev. 179, 197, fns. omitted, italics added (hereafter Danforth).)\nUnder this reasoning, which I find persuasive, the law of patents would not be a bar to Moore’s assertion of an ownership interest in his cells and their products sufficient to warrant his sharing in the proceeds of their commercial exploitation.\nJump to Panelli\u0026rsquo;s Counter-Argument Having concluded—mistakenly, in my view—that Moore has no cause of action for conversion under existing law, the majority next consider whether to “extend” the conversion cause of action to this context. Again the majority find three reasons not to do so, and again I respectfully disagree with each.\nThe majority’s first reason is that a balancing of the “relevant policy considerations” counsels against recognizing a conversion cause of action in these circumstances. (Maj. opn., ante, p. 160 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 493 of 793 P.2d.) The memo identifies two such policies, but concedes that one of them—“protection of a competent patient’s right to make autonomous medical decisions” (id. at p. 160 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 493 of 793 P.2d)—would in fact be promoted, even though “indirectly,” by recognizing a conversion cause of action. (Id. at p. 160 of 271 Cal.Rptr., at p. 493 of 793 P.2d.)\nThe majority focus instead on a second policy consideration, i.e., their concern “that we not threaten with disabling civil liability innocent parties who are engaged in socially useful activities, such as researchers who have no reason to believe that their use of a particular cell sample is, or may be, against a donor’s wishes.” (Maj. opn., ante, p. 160 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 493 of 793 P.2d.) As will appear, in my view this concern is both overstated and outweighed by contrary considerations.\nThe majority begin their analysis by stressing the obvious facts that research on human cells plays an increasingly important role in the progress of medicine, and that the manipulation of those cells by the methods of biotechnology has resulted in numerous beneficial products and treatments. Yet it does not necessarily follow that, as the majority claim, application of the law of conversion to this area “will hinder research by restricting access to the necessary raw materials,” i.e., to cells, cell cultures, and cell lines. (Maj. opn., ante, p. 161 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 494 of 793 P.2d.) The majority observe that many researchers obtain their tissue samples, routinely and at little or no cost, from cell-culture repositories. The majority then speculate that “This exchange of scientific materials, which still is relatively free and efficient, will surely be compromised if each cell sample becomes the potential subject matter of a lawsuit.” (Maj. opn., ante, p. 162 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 495 of 793 P.2d.) There are two grounds to doubt that this prophecy will be fulfilled.\nTo begin with, if the relevant exchange of scientific materials was ever “free and efficient,” it is much less so today. Since biological products of genetic engineering became patentable in 1980 (Diamond v. Chakrabarty 1980) 447 U.S. 303, 100 S.Ct. 2204, 65 L.Ed.2d 144), human cell lines have been amenable to patent protection and, as the Court of Appeal observed in its opinion below, “The rush to patent for exclusive use has been rampant.” Among those who have taken advantage of this development, of course, are the defendants herein: as we have seen, defendants Golde and Quan obtained a patent on the Mo cell line in 1984 and assigned it to defendant Regents. With such patentability has come a drastic reduction in the formerly free access of researchers to new cell lines and their products: the “novelty” requirement for patentability prohibits public disclosure of the invention at all times up to one year before the filing of the patent application. (35 U.S.C. § 102(b).) Thus defendants herein recited in their patent specification, “At no time has the Mo cell line been available to other than the investigators involved with its initial discovery and only the conditioned medium from the cell line has been made available to a limited number of investigators for collaborative work with the original discoverers of the Mo cell line.”\nAn even greater force for restricting the free exchange of new cell lines and their products has been the rise of the biotechnology industry and the increasing involvement of academic researchers in that industry. When scientists became entrepreneurs and negotiated with biotechnological and pharmaceutical companies to develop and exploit the commercial potential of their discoveries—as did defendants in the case at bar—layers of contractual restrictions were added to the protections of the patent law.\nIn their turn, the biotechnological and pharmaceutical companies demanded and received exclusive rights in the scientists’ discoveries, and frequently placed those discoveries under trade secret protection. Trade secret protection is popular among biotechnology companies because, among other reasons, the invention need not meet the strict standards of patentability and the protection is both quickly acquired and unlimited in duration. (Note, Patent and Trade Secret Protection in University–Industry Research Relationships in Biotechnology (1987) 24 Harv.J. on Legis. 191, 218–219.) Secrecy as a normal business practice is also taking hold in university research laboratories, often because of industry pressure (id. at pp. 204–208): “One of the most serious fears associated with university-industry cooperative research concerns keeping work private and not disclosing it to the researcher’s peers. [Citation.] \u0026hellip; Economic arrangements between industry and universities inhibit open communication between researchers, especially for those who are financially tied to smaller biotechnology firms.” (Howard, supra, 44 Food Drug Cosm.L.J. at p. 339, fn. 72.)\nSecondly, to the extent that cell cultures and cell lines may still be “freely exchanged,” e.g., for purely research purposes, it does not follow that the researcher who obtains such material must necessarily remain ignorant of any limitations on its use: by means of appropriate record keeping, the researcher can be assured that the source of the material has consented to his proposed use of it, and hence that such use is not a conversion. To achieve this end the originator of the tissue sample first determines the extent of the source’s informed consent to its use— e.g., for research only, or for public but academic use, or for specific or general commercial purposes; he then enters this information in the record of the tissue sample, and the record accompanies the sample into the hands of any researcher who thereafter undertakes to work with it. “Record keeping would not be overly burdensome because researchers generally keep accurate records of tissue sources for other reasons: to trace anomalies to the medical history of the patient, to maintain title for other researchers and for themselves, and to insure reproducibility of the experiment.” (Toward the Right of Commerciality, supra, 34 UCLA L.Rev. at p. 241.) As the Court of Appeal correctly observed, any claim to the contrary “is dubious in light of the meticulous care and planning necessary in serious modern medical research.”\nThe majority rely on Brown v. Superior Court, supra, 44 Cal.3d 1049, 245 Cal.Rptr. 412, 751 P.2d 470 (hereafter Brown), but the case is plainly distinguishable. In a unanimous opinion that I authored for the court, we considered inter alia whether pharmaceutical manufacturers should be held strictly liable for injuries caused by “defectively designed” prescription drugs. We declined to so hold for several policy reasons.(Id. at pp. 1063–1065, 245 Cal.Rptr. 412, 751 P.2d 470.) One of those reasons was our concern that “the fear of large adverse monetary judgments” might dissuade such manufacturers from developing or distributing potentially beneficial new drugs. (Id. at p. 1063, 245 Cal.Rptr. 412, 751 P.2d 470.) The majority now seek to draw an analogy between Brown and the case at bar, but the analogy fails because liability exposure in the Brown context is qualitatively far greater. As we acknowledged in Brown, “unlike other important medical products \u0026hellip; harm to some users from prescription drugs is unavoidable.”(Ibid., italics added.) On an industry-wide basis, therefore, the imposition of strict liability for defective prescription drugs would inevitably result in hundreds, if not thousands, of meritorious claims by often seriously harmed plaintiffs, most of them likely to be seeking exemplary as well as compensatory damages. Given the innocence and vulnerability of the typical plaintiff in such cases, sympathetic juries might well return substantial verdicts again and again, and the industry’s total liability could reach intimidating proportions. Indeed, in Brown we chronicled actual instances in which the mere threat of such liability did cause the industry to refuse to supply new prescription drugs. (Id. at p. 1064, 245 Cal.Rptr. 412, 751 P.2d 470.)\nNone of the foregoing is true in the case at bar. The majority claim that a conversion cause of action threatens to “destroy the economic incentive” to conduct the type of research here in issue (maj. opn., ante, p. 162 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 495 of 793 P.2d), but it is difficult to take this hyperbole seriously. First, the majority reason that with every cell sample a researcher “purchases a ticket in a litigation lottery.” (Id. at p. 162–163 of 271 Cal.Rptr., at p. 495–496 of 793 P.2d.)This is a colorful image, but it does not necessarily reflect reality: as explained above, with proper record keeping the researcher acquires not a litigation-lottery ticket but the information he needs precisely in order to avoid litigation. In contrast to Brown,therefore, here the harm is by no means “unavoidable.” Second, the risk at hand is not of a multiplicity of actions: in Brown the harm would be suffered by many members of the public—the users of the end product of the process of developing the new drug—while here it can be suffered by only one person—the original source of the research material that began that process. Third, the harm to the latter will be primarily economic, rather than the potentially grave physical injuries at issue in Brown.\nIn any event, in my view whatever merit the majority’s single policy consideration may have is outweighed by two contrary considerations, i.e., policies that are promoted by recognizing that every individual has a legally protectable property interest in his own body and its products. First, our society acknowledges a profound ethical imperative to respect the human body as the physical and temporal expression of the unique human persona. One manifestation of that respect is our prohibition against direct abuse of the body by torture or other forms of cruel or unusual punishment. Another is our prohibition against indirect abuse of the body by its economic exploitation for the sole benefit of another person. The most abhorrent form of such exploitation, of course, was the institution of slavery. Lesser forms, such as indentured servitude or even debtor’s prison, have also disappeared. Yet their specter haunts the laboratories and boardrooms of today’s biotechnological research-industrial complex. It arises wherever scientists or industrialists claim, as defendants claim here, the right to appropriate and exploit a patient’s tissue for their sole economic benefit —the right, in other words, to freely mine or harvest valuable physical properties of the patient’s body: “Research with human cells that results in significant economic gain for the researcher and no gain for the patient offends the traditional mores of our society in a manner impossible to quantify. Such research tends to treat the human body as a commodity—a means to a profitable end. The dignity and sanctity with which we regard the human whole, body as well as mind and soul, are absent when we allow researchers to further their own interests without the patient’s participation by using a patient’s cells as the basis for a marketable product.” (Danforth, supra, 6 Yale L. \u0026amp; Pol’y Rev. at p. 190, fn. omitted.)\nA second policy consideration adds notions of equity to those of ethics. Our society values fundamental fairness in dealings between its members, and condemns the unjust enrichment of any member at the expense of another. This is particularly true when, as here, the parties are not in equal bargaining positions. We are repeatedly told that the commercial products of the biotechnological revolution “hold the promise of tremendous profit.” (Toward the Right of Commerciality, supra, 34 UCLA L.Rev. at p. 211.)In the case at bar, for example, the complaint alleges that the market for the kinds of proteins produced by the Mo cell line was predicted to exceed $3 billion by 1990. These profits are currently shared exclusively between the biotechnology industry and the universities that support that industry. The profits are shared in a wide variety of ways, including “direct entrepreneurial ties to genetic-engineering firms” and “an equity interest in fledgling biotechnology firms” (Howard, supra, 44 Food Drug Cosm.L.J. at p. 338). Thus the complaint alleges that because of his development of the Mo cell line defendant Golde became a paid consultant of defendant Genetics Institute and acquired the rights to 75,000 shares of that firm’s stock at a cost of 1 cent each; that Genetics Institute further contracted to pay Golde and the Regents at least $330,000 over 3 years, including a pro rata share of Golde’s salary and fringe benefits; and that defendant Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corporation subsequently contracted to increase that compensation by a further $110,000.\nThere is, however, a third party to the biotechnology enterprise—the patient who is the source of the blood or tissue from which all these profits are derived. While he may be a silent partner, his contribution to the venture is absolutely crucial: as pointed out above (pt. 3, ante), but for the cells of Moore’s body taken by defendants there would have been no Mo cell line at all.Yet defendants deny that Moore is entitled to any share whatever in the proceeds of this cell line. This is both inequitable and immoral. As Dr. Thomas H. Murray, a respected professor of ethics and public policy, testified before Congress, “the person [who furnishes the tissue] should be justly compensated\u0026hellip;. If biotechnologists fail to make provision for a just sharing of profits with the person whose gift made it possible, the public’s sense of justice will be offended and no one will be the winner.” (Murray, Who Owns the Body? On the Ethics of Using Human Tissue for Commercial Purposes (Jan.–Feb.1986) IRB: A Review of Human Subjects Research, at p. 5.)\nThere will be such equitable sharing if the courts recognize that the patient has a legally protected property interest in his own body and its products: “property rights in one’s own tissue would provide a morally acceptable result by giving effect to notions of fairness and preventing unjust enrichment\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Societal notions of equity and fairness demand recognition of property rights. There are bountiful benefits, monetary and otherwise, to be derived from human biologics. To deny the person contributing the raw material a fair share of these ample benefits is both unfair and morally wrong.” (Toward the Right of Commerciality, supra, 34 UCLA L.Rev. at p. 229.) Recognizing a donor’s property rights would prevent unjust enrichment by giving monetary rewards to the donor and researcher proportionate to the value of their respective contributions. Biotechnology depends upon the contributions of both patients and researchers. If not for the patient’s contribution of cells with unique attributes, the medical value of the bioengineered cells would be negligible. But for the physician’s contribution of knowledge and skill in developing the cell product, the commercial value of the patient’s cells would also be negligible. Failing to compensate the patient unjustly enriches the researcher because only the researcher’s contribution is recognized.” (Id. at p. 230.) In short, as the Court of Appeal succinctly put it, “If this science has become science for profit, then we fail to see any justification for excluding the patient from participation in those profits.”\nJump to Panelli\u0026rsquo;s Counter-Argument The majority’s second reason for declining to extend the conversion cause of action to the present context is that “the Legislature should make that decision.” (Maj. opn., ante, p. 163 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 496 of 793 P.2d.) I do not doubt that the Legislature is competent to act on this topic. The fact that the Legislature may intervene if and when it chooses, however, does not in the meanwhile relieve the courts of their duty of enforcing—or if need be, fashioning—an effective judicial remedy for the wrong here alleged. As I observed above (pt. 1, ante), if a conversion cause of action is otherwise an appropriate remedy on these facts we should not refrain from recognizing it merely because the Legislature has not yet addressed the question. To do so would be to abdicate pro tanto our responsibility over a body of law—torts—that is particularly a creature of the common law. And such reluctance to act would be especially unfortunate at the present time, when the rapid expansion of biotechnological science and industry makes resolution of these issues an increasingly pressing need.\nThe inference I draw from the current statutory regulation of human biological materials, moreover, is the opposite of that drawn by the majority. By selective quotation of the statutes (maj. opn., ante, p. 156, fns. 22 \u0026amp; 23 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 489, fns. 22 \u0026amp; 23 of 793 P.2d) the majority seem to suggest that human organs and blood cannot legally be sold on the open market—thereby implying that if the Legislature were to act here it would impose a similar ban on monetary compensation for the use of human tissue in biotechnological research and development. But if that is the argument, the premise is unsound: contrary to popular misconception, it is not true that human organs and blood cannot legally be sold.\nAs to organs, the majority rely on the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (Health \u0026amp; Saf.Code, § 7150 et seq., hereafter the UAGA) for the proposition that a competent adult may make a post mortem gift of any part of his body but may not receive “valuable consideration” for the transfer. But the prohibition of the UAGA against the sale of a body part is much more limited than the majority recognize: by its terms (Health \u0026amp; Saf. Code, § 7155, subd. (a)) the prohibition applies only to sales for “transplantation” or “therapy.” Yet a different section of the UAGA authorizes the transfer and receipt of body parts for such additional purposes as “medical or dental education, research, or advancement of medical or dental science.” (Health \u0026amp; Saf. Code, § 7153, subd. (a)(1).) No section of the UAGA prohibits anyone from selling body parts for any of those additional purposes; by clear implication, therefore, such sales are legal. Indeed, the fact that the UAGA prohibits no sales of organs other than sales for “transportation” or “therapy” raises a further implication that it is also legal for anyone to sell human tissue to a biotechnology company for research and development purposes.\nWith respect to the sale of human blood the matter is much simpler: there is in fact no prohibition against such sales. The majority rely (maj. opn., ante, p. 156, fn. 23 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 489, fn. 23 of 793 P.2d) on Health and Safety Code section 1606, which provides in relevant part that the procurement and use of blood for transfusion “shall be construed to be, and is declared to be \u0026hellip; the rendition of a service \u0026hellip; and shall not be construed to be, and is declared not to be, a sale\u0026hellip;.” There is less here, however, than meets the eye: the statute does not mean that a person cannot sell his blood or, by implication, that his blood is not his property. “While many jurisdictions have classified the transfer of blood or other human tissue as a service rather than a sale, this position does not conflict with the notion that human tissue is property.” (Columbia Note, supra, 90 Colum.L.Rev. at p. 544, fn. 76.) The reason is plain: “No State or Federal statute prohibits the sale of blood, plasma, semen, or other replenishing tissues if taken in non-vital amounts. Nevertheless, State laws usually characterize these paid transfers as the provision of services rather than the sale of a commodity\u0026hellip;.\n\u0026ldquo;The primary legal reason for characterizing these transactions as involving services rather than goods is to avoid liability for contaminated blood products under either general product liability principles or the [Uniform Commercial Code’s] implied warranty provisions.” (OTA Rep., supra, at p. 76, fn. omitted.) The courts have repeatedly recognized that the foregoing is the real purpose of this harmless legal fiction. (See, e.g., Hyland Therapeutics v. Superior Court (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 509, 220 Cal.Rptr. 590;Cramer v. Queen of Angels Hosp. (1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 812, 133 Cal.Rptr. 339;Shepard v. Alexian Brothers Hosp. (1973) 33 Cal.App.3d 606, 109 Cal.Rptr. 132.) Thus despite the statute relied on by the majority, it is perfectly legal in this state for a person to sell his blood for transfusion or for any other purpose indeed, such sales are commonplace, particularly in the market for plasma. (See OTA Rep., supra, at p. 121.)\nIt follows that the statutes regulating the transfers of human organs and blood do not support the majority’s refusal to recognize a conversion cause of action for commercial exploitation of human blood cells without consent. On the contrary, because such statutes treat both organs and blood as property that can legally be sold in a variety of circumstances, they impliedly support Moore’s contention that his blood cells are likewise property for which he can and should receive compensation, and hence are protected by the law of conversion.\nJump to Panelli\u0026rsquo;s Counter-Argument The majority’s final reason for refusing to recognize a conversion cause of action on these facts is that “there is no pressing need” to do so because the complaint also states another cause of action that is assertedly adequate to the task (maj. opn., ante, p. 163 of 271 Cal.Rptr., p. 496 of 793 P.2d); that cause of action is “the breach of a fiduciary duty to disclose facts material to the patient’s consent or, alternatively, \u0026hellip; the performance of medical procedures without first having obtained the patient’s informed consent” (id. at p. 150 of 271 Cal.Rptr., at p. 483 of 793 P.2d). Although last, this reason is not the majority’s least; in fact, it underlies much of the opinion’s discussion of the conversion cause of action, recurring like a leitmotiv throughout that discussion.\nThe majority hold that a physician who intends to treat a patient in whom he has either a research interest or an economic interest is under a fiduciary duty to disclose such interest to the patient before treatment; that his failure to do so may give rise to a nondisclosure cause of action; and that the complaint herein states such a cause of action at least against defendant Golde. I agree with that holding as far as it goes.\nI disagree, however, with the majority’s further conclusion that in the present context a nondisclosure cause of action is an adequate—in fact, a superior—substitute for a conversion cause of action. In my view the nondisclosure cause of action falls short on at least three grounds.\nIn his final set of arguments, Justice Mosk addresses the majority\u0026rsquo;s position that the availability of a claim for breach of fiduciary duty is sufficient to vindicate Moore\u0026rsquo;s interests in the case. You do not need to read this aspect of Justice Mosk\u0026rsquo;s judgement in detail — it wades into a thicket of tort law consideration that don\u0026rsquo;t concern us here. The summative paragraph below is sufficient for you to understand Justice Mosk\u0026rsquo;s position in this aspect of the argument. In sum, the nondisclosure cause of action (1) is unlikely to be successful in most cases, (2) fails to protect patients’ rights to share in the proceeds of the commercial exploitation of their tissue, and (3) may allow the true exploiters to escape liability. It is thus not an adequate substitute, in my view, for the conversion cause of action.\nJump to Panelli\u0026rsquo;s Counter-Argument [\u0026hellip;]\nI would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeal to direct the trial court to overrule the demurrers to the cause of action for conversion.\n"},{"id":52,"href":"/casebook/other/tenures-estates/","title":"Tenures Estates","section":"Chapter 6","content":" Excerpted from Jeremy Sheff, \u0026ldquo;Estates and Future Interests\u0026rdquo; in Stephen Clowney, James Grimmelmann, Michael Grynberg, Jeremy Sheff, and Rebecca Tushnet, eds., Open Source Property: A Free Casebook (2015). According to the common law doctrine of tenure all land under the dominion of the English crown is held “mediately or immediately, of the king”—that is, the crown has “radical title” to all land under its political dominion. William the Conqueror declared that all land in England was literally the king’s property; everyone else had to settle for the privilege of holding it for him—the privilege of tenure (from the Norman French word “tenir”—to hold). Tenurial rights were intensely personal in early feudal society: the right to hold land was a privilege granted by the crown in exchange for an oath of allegiance and a promise of military service by the tenant—the oath of homage. The word homage derives from the French word homme—literally “man”—precisely because the ceremony surrounding the oath created not only the right of tenure, but a political and military relationship between “lord and man.” In exchange for the tenant’s loyal support, or fealty, the lord warranted the tenant’s right to hold a plot of land, called a fief, or fee.\nAcceptance of this form of military tenure obligated the tenant to provide a certain number of knights when called on by the king, and the land held by the tenant was supposed to provide sufficient material support to enable him to meet this military obligation. Sometimes, by the process of subinfeudation, the King’s direct tenants (or “tenants-in-chief”) could spread this burden around by in turn accepting homage from other, lesser nobles and freemen, each of whom would be responsible to the tenant-in-chief for a portion of the tenant-in-chief’s obligation to provide knight-service. The tenants-in-chief thereby became “mesne lords” in their own right (“mesne” being Norman French for “middle” or “intermediate”). There could be several layers of mesne lords (i.e., “land lords”) in the feudal hierarchy, at the bottom of which were “tenants in demesne” (“demesne” being Norman French for “domain” or “dominion”)—who actually held the land rather than subinfeudating it further. Of course, holding land did not mean one actually worked it; a tenant in demesne often left the cultivation and productive use of land to those of lower social status. These could be “villeins”—serfs legally bound to the land by birth—or “leasehold” tenants—a leasehold being a right to hold land for a term of years in exchange for payment of rent in cash or (more often) kind, and of lesser status than the “freehold” estate held by feudal tenants tracing their rights up the feudal pyramid to the crown.\nBecause a feudal tenant’s land rights were intimately connected to this web of personal, political, and military relationships, there was no logical reason why the tenant ought to be free to transfer those rights to anyone else—and good reason for the lords to resist such alienation of the fee by their tenants. Indeed, fees could be forfeited to the lord for the tenant’s breach of the homage relationship or commission of some other “felony,” and on the tenant’s death it was not clear that his family members had the right to inherit the fee. The king was assumed to have the right to retake the fee and re-grant it to a preferable new tenant upon his displeasure with or the death of the old tenant (it was his land, after all). Within a century, however, the dynastic ambitions of the baronage compelled King Henry I to concede (in his Coronation Charter of 1100) that a recently deceased baron’s heir could redeem his fee upon payment of “a just and lawful relief”—i.e., a payment of money to the crown, as a kind of inheritance tax. Under the principle of primogeniture that took hold in England around this time, the lord’s heir was his eldest son; landowners were not free to choose who would take over their tenancy after their death. Thus, subject to the payment of a relief, the fee became descendible—capable of being inherited from one generation to the next—and the grant of a descendible tenancy by the crown was now made not “to Lord Hobnob,” but “to Lord Hobnob and his heirs.” To this day, the latter phrase remains the classic common-law formula for creating the broadest interest in land that the law will recognize: the fee simple absolute.\nDescendibility of the fee simple having been settled early in the history of English land law, the broader question of full alienability took several more centuries to work out. The history of medieval English land law is a history of tenants trying to secure their families’ wealth and power by expanding alienability and evading tenurial obligations to their lords and the crown, while the crown and higher nobility tried to adapt the law to preserve their status and prevent such evasions. There is a dialectical quality to this history. For example: for complicated reasons subinfeudation quickly came to present a greater threat to the economic interests of the higher ranks of the feudal hierarchy than simple substitution of one tenant for another. Thus, in 1290 the Statute of Quia Emptores banned subinfeudation. But in doing so it validated substitution, and with it the practice of selling an entire fee in exchange for money during the life of the tenant. Similarly, in 1536, at the insistence of King Henry VIII, the Statute of Uses abolished many clever schemes adopted by tenants to use intermediaries to direct the disposition of real property interests after death and to put those interests outside the reach of the law courts (and of the crown’s feudal authority). But in doing so, the statute validated one type of flexible property arrangement we have come to know as a trust. Moreover, the removal of the primary mechanism lawyers had developed to meet tenants’ demand for intergenerational planning was sufficiently unpopular that Henry felt compelled to consent to the enactment of the Statute of Wills in 1540—finally permitting tenants to pass their legal estates in land by will rather than being at the whim of the rule of primogeniture. Finally, since the 16th century, primogeniture has given way to a more complex system of default inheritance rights for various relatives of the deceased who leaves no will; these rights are designed to try to approximate what legislatures think the decedent would have wanted, not necessarily what is best for the government. This set of default rights comprises the law of intestate succession […]\nVarious other statutes and common-law developments over the centuries culminated in the system of possessory estates and future interests that were imported into the North American English colonies, and thus into the independent American states (excluding Louisiana). Underlying them all is a fundamental distinction that traces back to the “radical title” asserted by William the Conqueror in 1066: there is a conceptual difference between the ownership of land and the ownership of a legal interest in that land […]\nBasic Estates and Future Interests # We will begin by examining two possessory estates—the fee simple absolute and the life estate—and two future interests \u0026hellip; —the reversion and the remainder.\nThe Fee Simple Absolute # The fee simple absolute is the most complete interest in land that the law will recognize. When we say that “O owns Blackacre” without any further qualification, what we actually mean is that O owns a presently possessory fee simple absolute in Blackacre. The key distinguishing characteristic of the fee simple absolute is that it has no inherent end—it is an estate of indefinite duration. It is descendible, devisable, and alienable inter vivos; so it can be transferred to a new owner, but it cannot be destroyed. At most, it can be carved up into lesser estates and interests for a while, and we will spend most of the rest of this chapter understanding how that happens.\nAt common law, as previously noted, the fee simple absolute was created by the formula: “to A and his heirs.” That formula still works, but in modern usage it is sufficient to simply say “to A,” and the use of such language in a conveyance from the owner of a fee simple absolute will be presumed to create a fee simple absolute in A.\nThe Life Estate # The life estate is just what it sounds like: an estate that confers a right to possession for the life of its owner. The owner of a life estate is referred to as a life tenant. The life estate terminates by operation of law upon the owner’s death (i.e., it ceases to exist). It is created by the formula: “to A for life.” Because it must by definition end—we all have to die sometime—any land held by a life tenant must also be subject to a future interest in some other person.\n[…]\nThe Reversion # […] Consider what happens when A, owning a life estate in Blackacre, dies. A’s life estate terminates by operation of law; it simply ceases to exist and disappears. Who “owns” Blackacre now? It seems obvious that somebody must have a right to possession of the land, but it seems equally obvious that whoever that somebody is, they had no right to possession before A died. Whoever they are, during the term of A’s life estate they must have held an interest that would entitle them to take possession at some point in the future (that is, a future interest).\nThere are two candidates for such an interest. We will begin with the most basic: the reversion. Suppose that O, owning a fee simple absolute in Blackacre, conveys Blackacre “to A for life,” and says nothing more? What is the legal effect of this grant?\nBased on the formula we just learned, it should be clear that A receives a life estate in Blackacre. But what other effects does the grant have on the legal rights of the parties? Think about the interest O held prior to the conveyance: the fee simple absolute. Remember that a fee simple absolute is an interest of infinite duration—it never ends. So when O starts with a possessory interest of infinite duration, and then gives away a life estate—whose duration is limited by a human lifespan—to A, something was left over. Specifically, O never gave away the right to possession of Blackacre from the day of A’s death to the end of time. Whether meaning to or not, O gave away less of an interest in Blackacre than what he owned, meaning he still holds some interest. We call this type of interest—the residual interest left over when a grantor gives away less than they have—a retained interest.\nThis retained interest can’t entitle O to possession during A’s life—A has the exclusive right to possession as the life tenant. So O’s interest must be a future interest during the term of A’s life estate: an interest that will entitle O to possession after the natural termination of the life estate. As we discussed in the example of the lease, we call this kind of future interest a reversion. It is a retained interest in the grantor—created when a grantor conveys less than his entire interest—that will become possessory by operation of law upon the natural termination of the preceding estate. Colloquially, we say that Blackacre “reverts” to O. In some opinions, you will see the holder of a reversion referred to as a “reversioner.”\nA reversion can of course also be created explicitly, for example, if O conveys Blackacre “to A for life, then to O.” In this case, O has explicitly created a life estate in A followed by a reversion in O.\nThe Remainder # A remainder is a type of future interest created in someone other than the grantor. The distinguishing characteristic of the remainder is that—like a reversion—it cannot cut short or divest any possessory estate. (We will later encounter other future interests that can.) A remainder simply “remains,” sitting around and waiting for the natural termination of the preceding possessory estate (be it a life estate or a lease), at which point the remainder will become possessory by operation of law. Suppose that O, owning a fee simple absolute in Blackacre, conveys Blackacre “to A for life, and then to B.” Again, A would have a life estate, but now O has also affirmatively created a future interest in B. Because the future interest is created in someone other than the grantor, it isn’t a reversion. And because it cannot cut short A’s life estate (note the “and then” language), it must therefore be a remainder. Due to the persistence of dated gendered terms in legal discourse, you will often see the holder of a remainder referred to as a “remainderman,” even today, regardless of that person’s gender.\n"},{"id":53,"href":"/planning/description/","title":"Description","section":"Planning","content":"This text develops a new approach to the conventional first-year Property Law course that is still taught in most Canadian law schools.

In addition, consider the way Henderson engages with some of the common law rationales for property rights regimes we looked at previously\u0026hellip; [A]n Aboriginal worldview is a spatial consciousness rather than material consciousness. Sharing and mobility discourages the accumulation of inessential resources. The sharing of space, then, is the meaning for all of Aboriginal life. The relations contained in those spaces shape both choice and placement and ultimately group life. Aboriginal people do not speak of living \u0026ldquo;there\u0026rdquo;; rather, each family or person \u0026ldquo;belongs\u0026rdquo; to the space. Belonging, then, is directly tied both linguistically and experientially to a space as well as to shared knowledge of a series of common places. Belonging to a space is more than just living in a place or using its resources; it is attendant with benefits and obligations. Belonging is viewed as a special responsibility.1\nHenderson also offers a specific example of how this kind of belonging is communicated as part of the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw system of land tenure:\nRenewal ceremonies also emphasize the relationship between space and claims in the indigenous Mikmaw worldview. The places of certain ceremonies are bounded to a specific location and can be transported. They symbolically reiterated and renewed the ancient relationships between a particular family and people and a particular ecosystem. The grounding in a particular ecosystem has been categorized as \u0026ldquo;geopiety\u0026rdquo;. In the renewal ceremonies, various family claims are continually being asserted and adjusted. While each renegotiation affects family allegiance and identity, this is seen as relatively unimportant; the crucial factor is the periodic equalization of shared rights among the collective families.2 Keep in mind how Henderson\u0026rsquo;s description of renewal ceremonies relates to (or conflicts with) ways of communicating possession within the common law tradition.\nJames [sákéj] Youngblood Henderson, “Mikmaw Tenure in Atlantic Canada” (1995) 18(2) Dalhousie Law Journal 196 at 219\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nJames [sákéj] Youngblood Henderson, “Mikmaw Tenure in Atlantic Canada” (1995) 18(2) Dalhousie Law Journal 196 at 234\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":59,"href":"/problems/auto-insurance/","title":"A \"Monkey Wrench in the Free Market\"","section":"Problems","content":"In October 2003, the Government of Nova Scotia introduced a bill with proposed amendments to automobile insurance laws in the province.

Some of the proposed amendments included a temporary cap on insurance rates, a requirement that the Nova Scotia Insurance Review Board approve the way that insurers classify risk (which determines how much individuals in each class pay for insurance), and a cap on the amount of non-monetary loss (such as for pain and suffering) that insured people can claim for minor injuries.\nBelow is an excerpt from the official report of the House of Assembly debates (called Hansard) that contains MLA Kevin Deveaux\u0026rsquo;s response to the bill when it was introduced.

I\u0026rsquo;ve been listening to the different debates and particularly, obviously, from members from this side of the House, Opposition members, members from the Third Party, members from our Party. I haven\u0026rsquo;t heard much from the Tory caucus yet. I would hope that maybe they would take the chance to get up because this is an opportunity for them to put on the record what they heard from their constituents because presumably from this bill we can presume that the government has talked to their constituents, that the constituents have expressed to them the desire that this type of legislation come forward.\nI must say that\u0026rsquo;s a very different opinion than I received when I was on the doorstep because the Nova Scotians I spoke to, the people in my riding of Cole Harbour-Eastern Passage, had a very different perspective.

They wanted lower rates that could be guaranteed and that could be based on a legitimate form of insurance and, quite frankly, this bill doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide that. This bill is, quite frankly, trying to tinker with a free market system that we have in this province. We have a free market system of insurance. If I want insurance for my vehicle, of course it\u0026rsquo;s mandatory according to the Motor Vehicle Act, to drive a car I need insurance, then I go to the marketplace and there are private companies that will provide me with insurance.\nThat system had in the past worked well for our province, but I would suggest to you the system is broken, that it has failed and that the rates now are not good enough. They are too high and many Nova Scotians are unable to afford insurance. We see that in the rates on which the number of people who are being charged with driving without insurance has increased. Most of them are telling us they can\u0026rsquo;t afford the insurance. So it\u0026rsquo;s important for them to go out and actually drive.\nNow, we all know that\u0026rsquo;s not legal, or that\u0026rsquo;s not right and, of course, that isn\u0026rsquo;t appropriate, but there are other means of trying to ensure that people can drive while ensuring that they have automobile insurance so that they and others, if they get in an accident, are protected. That\u0026rsquo;s really what this system is about. Don\u0026rsquo;t drive a vehicle unless you have a pool of money for which, if you get in an accident, that money can be drawn upon to ensure that people are going to be protected, whether you hit a pedestrian in a crosswalk, or whether you bump into someone else\u0026rsquo;s car, or whether they bump into you.\nMr. Speaker, there needs to be a pool of money through insurance to ensure that that money is going to be there to protect people and ensure that they are going to be able to be provided for because in some cases it\u0026rsquo;s very serious, in death obviously, but people can be paralyzed. People could have a closed head injury that could result in them spending the rest of their lives never being able to work again and some of the cases you hear about, obviously, are very compassionate, but the fact is that, you know, some of the most classic examples I recall from days of studying are those in which someone may be 20 or 22 years old, or maybe a little older, in their 20s, and they just finished their university degree, or maybe they just finished medical school, or maybe they just finished law school and they have great potential to become someone who is going to earn a lot of money in their life and they are struck by a car, or they are in a car accident, and there has to be some determination through the Insurance Act. That\u0026rsquo;s what we provide - rules and regulations as to how we determine what those policies will provide for so that those people are provided with an income and that income should be based on future loss, future potential loss in many cases.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not so hard when they\u0026rsquo;re 50 and you already know what their career is or if they\u0026rsquo;re younger maybe but, Mr. Speaker, the fact is that we have a very complicated system in this province, a complicated system of how we determine through the courts how much someone will be paid if they are injured and they are not able to go back to work - whether that\u0026rsquo;s for a day, a week, a month or for the rest of their life.\nThat system, as I said, had worked well. The problem is that it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been working, not that people haven\u0026rsquo;t been compensated if they are injured, not that people aren\u0026rsquo;t getting the money they deserve if someone else hits them with a vehicle and they are in a car or are a pedestrian, that part hasn\u0026rsquo;t broken down; what has broken down, Mr. Speaker, is the cost that is prohibitive to so many Nova Scotians that prevents them from being able to afford the insurance. And in a province like ours, a car is not only a privilege, it\u0026rsquo;s invaluable.\nIn many parts of this province outside of Halifax and maybe parts of CBRM, there is no choice. The concept of having public transit, to be able to transport you around as a means of going for groceries or going to the store to buy clothing, it\u0026rsquo;s just not practical, it\u0026rsquo;s not there. So a car is a necessity. Because of that, a car becomes a necessity in rural Nova Scotia, Mr. Speaker, to most Nova Scotians, therefore we must ensure that we have affordable insurance.\nThis government, Mr. Speaker, has taken the position that affordable insurance comes from sticking a monkey wrench in the free market system. This bill basically tells the insurance companies, and I suspect they were aware this was coming, I suspect there were consultations with the insurance industry, that this isn\u0026rsquo;t coming out of the blue to them. Considering the same day this bill came out, the Insurance Bureau of Canada had full page ads in the local newspapers saying how they felt this was a wonderful idea. So I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m too far off in suggesting there might have been some consultations between the government and the Insurance Bureau of Canada before this bill ever hit the desks of the members in this House.\nBut because of this, Mr. Speaker, as I say, a money [sic] wrench has been driven into the free market system. This has already been tried in New Brunswick, a few months ago, and we are beginning to already see the problems that have been caused by this approach. I find it quite ironic that a Party like the Progressive Conservative Party that for so many is equated with a Party of the free market, a Party of a form of neo-Liberalism in which we ensure that business should be able - we should get off the backs of business.\nI remember a few years ago when this Party got re-elected to government in 1999, Mr. Speaker, they created a red tape committee because they wanted to make sure that we were going to reduce the red tape for business so that business could get on with the job of creating jobs and government would do the job of minimizing the amount of regulation that would be required. We didn\u0026rsquo;t hear much of it after awhile. I think the backbenchers who were involved sort of petered out and decided to do something else.\nBut the fact is, that this government has a history, or this Party that is the government, Mr. Speaker, has a history of presenting itself as the Party supporting the free market system. Supporting a system that ensures that business should be able to be minimally regulated and, in return, they will ensure that most of the money that they spend will be in creating jobs and putting it back into the economy, sort of the free hand of capitalism. That is what the Progressive Conservative Party has generally stood for over the years. That\u0026rsquo;s what this government, I think, has generally run itself on.\nYet what do we see in this legislation? We see massive regulation, we see complicated rules imposed on businesses as some form or way of manipulating or twisting the free market system as a means of trying to argue we can reduce rates. Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, this government, I think, knew when this issue became a clear and present problem for them in January 2002, almost two years ago, when people started getting their renewal rates, and people started realizing the cost. Then the government said well we have a problem because the free market isn\u0026rsquo;t working. The private insurance companies aren\u0026rsquo;t able to provide this at a rate that most Nova Scotians can afford, it\u0026rsquo;s going sky-high, this is a problem, what are we going to do?\nWell there are a few options. Our Party decided to take one of those options, Mr. Speaker, and say the free market system isn\u0026rsquo;t working. In most cases we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say that. Our Party believes that in most cases the free market system works just fine. There are a few problems with regard to auto insurance though. Unlike most products where you have the automatic choice of deciding whether you want to buy this or buy that, or whether you want to buy the product at all. Do you want to buy guns or butter, I guess, as most economists would say, or do you want to buy butter or margarine, different types of the same product. With regard to auto insurance, consumers have no choice. They have to buy it if they have a car and as I said earlier, a car is a necessity in this province and therefore, quite frankly, most people in Nova Scotia have no choice. They have to buy insurance. In the free market system - well really, it isn\u0026rsquo;t a free market system if they are forced to buy it - we have a problem where those people are not able to get affordable insurance.\u0026quot;\n"},{"id":60,"href":"/problems/testementary-bequest/","title":"A Testamentary Bequest","section":"Problems","content":" Source: Aaron Burden on Unsplash\nA testator, recently deceased, has two surviving adult children who are the sole beneficiaries of the testator\u0026rsquo;s will.

As the quoted passage above notes, abandonment requires the owner to demonstrate an express intention to permanently abandon their property rights: they must have “the intention of terminating ownership, possession and control.”1\nFor example, in Manning v Algard, the defendant Algard lost or misplaced a briefcase containing 17th century gold coins. Those coins were later sold to Manning in a garage sale. Since Algard lost or misplaced his briefcase rather than intentionally leaving it behind, the court found that he had not abandoned the coins, and therefore concluded that Algard’s estate still held a superior property interest in them.\nHowever, as Chief Justice Hoyles also explains in Clift, there is a different rule with respect to wild animals (animals ferae naturae).

In the memo, provincial employees were instructed not to give territorial or title acknowledgements in the context of their work.

We have already emphasized the point that legal possession and legal title are distinctive concepts. In general, \u0026ldquo;mere possession\u0026rdquo; does not disturb the legal title of the landowner, but the doctrine of adverse possession creates a dramatic exception to this rule. Under the doctrine, when a person has been in possession of land for longer than a period established by statute (called the limitation period), they may become the title holder—and the original title holder may end up with nothing. The ultimate effect of adverse possession is to take title out of the hands of the original owner and to put that title into the hands of the person in possession.\nAdverse possession claims are not easily won. There is a laundry list of legal requirements that an adverse possessor needs to meet—in addition to possession beyond the limitation period. Our purpose in introducing adverse possession here is to explore how the doctrine helps us to understand the relationship between possession and title and how its underlying rationales came to be interpreted in the style of classical common law thought. From this perspective, adverse possession was fundamentally about competition between the title holder and the adverse possessor—competition that was generally resolved based on whether the court regarded the adverse possessor as a productive member of society putting land to good use or, alternatively, as a duplicitous trespasser seeking to take unfair advantage of the law.\n"},{"id":65,"href":"/context/ans-settlement/","title":"African Nova Scotian Settlement","section":"Context","content":"Although African Nova Scotians have lived in Nova Scotia since 17th century (many of them enslaved by British settlers), the major waves of African Nova Scotian migration occured in the 18th and 19th centuries.

McNeil cites the following quote attributed to Chief Ma-we-do-pe-nais on the third day of negotiations around Treaty 3, included in Alexander Morris\u0026rsquo; book on the Numbered Treaties: 1\nAll this is our property where you have come \u0026hellip; This is what we think, that the Great Spirit has planted us on this ground where we are, as you were where you came from.

The inability and unwillingness to acknowledge these perspectives and what they could have told the courts about the relevance of Indigenous peoples\u0026rsquo; own laws is grounded in an underlying assumption that is only hinted at but never explicitly acknowledged by the judges: the assumption that the British Crown had legitimately asserted sovereignty over Indigenous territories in North America and therefore had an \u0026ldquo;underlying interest\u0026rdquo; to begin with.\nThis assumption is premised on the so-called international law doctrine of discovery, which was used by European colonial powers to confiscate Indigenous peoples\u0026rsquo; lands and \u0026ldquo;destabilized their decision-making powers.\u0026rdquo;2 The doctrine of discovery was in turn constructed on the legal fiction of terra nullius—the fiction that Indigenous peoples had no established legal systems of their own prior to colonization. If Indigenous peoples had no laws, the land was \u0026ldquo;legally vacant\u0026rdquo; and therefore open to discovery and settlement.

Overview # This appeal calls upon the Court to clarify the circumstances in which state regulation of land use may effect a de facto or (as we will refer to it) “constructive” taking of private property.\nThe appellant, Annapolis Group Inc., contends that the respondent, Halifax Regional Municipality, improperly used its regulatory powers to effectively seize Annapolis’ land for use as a public park without compensation. Halifax says that Annapolis’ claim is a veiled attempt to make taxpayers foot the bill for a decades-long development gamble. It sought summary dismissal of this part of Annapolis’ claim, while permitting other claims (for misfeasance in public office and unjust enrichment) to proceed to trial.\nAlthough unsuccessful at first instance, Halifax persuaded the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal that it should apply this Court’s judgment in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Vancouver (City) 2006 SCC 5, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 227 (“CPR”), to strike that claim. Annapolis asks this Court to restore its claim in respect of the alleged constructive taking and allow it to proceed to trial.\nWe would allow Annapolis’ appeal.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nII. Factual Background # Over time from the 1950s, Annapolis acquired the subject property, comprising 965 acres of land (\u0026ldquo;Annapolis Lands\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Lands\u0026rdquo;), with the intention of eventually securing enhanced development rights and reselling it.\nIn 2006, Halifax adopted the Regional Municipal Planning Strategy, a guide for land development in the municipality, including the Annapolis Lands, over a 25-year period. While the Planning Strategy reserved a portion of the Annapolis Lands for possible future inclusion in a regional park, it also zoned the Lands as “Urban Settlement” and “Urban Reserve”. Urban Settlement denotes an area where urban forms of development may occur. Urban Reserve identifies land that could be developed beyond the 25-year horizon. These designations thus contemplate — but do not permit — future residential serviced development. For serviced development to occur on the Annapolis Lands, Halifax must adopt a resolution authorizing a “secondary planning process” and an amendment to the applicable land use by-law. The applicable by-law is the Halifax Mainland Land Use By-Law, also adopted in 2006.\nIn 2014, Halifax adopted a revised version of the Planning Strategy. The Urban Settlement and Urban Reserve designations were maintained, and thus the zoning of the Annapolis Lands did not change, and has not changed since 2006. Nor were the conceptual boundaries for the potential park altered.\nBeginning in 2007, Annapolis made several attempts to develop the Lands. Ultimately, by resolution dated September 6, 2016, Halifax refused to initiate the secondary planning process, and Annapolis sued, alleging a constructive taking, misfeasance in public office, and unjust enrichment.\nAt issue in this appeal is Annapolis’ allegation of a constructive taking. Specifically, Annapolis says that Halifax’s regulatory measures have deprived it of all reasonable or economic uses of its land, resulting in a constructive taking without compensation, contrary to ss. 65 and 237 of the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter, S.N.S. 2008, c. 39, and ss. 6 and 24 of the Expropriation Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 156. It alleges in particular that Halifax has acquired a beneficial interest in the Lands by exercising dominion over them so as to effectively create a public park at Annapolis’ expense. According to Annapolis, members of the public hike, cycle, canoe, camp, and swim on the Lands, are encouraged to do so by Halifax, and Halifax financially supports organizations that also encourage people to use the Lands as a park. Further, signs posted on the Lands allegedly depict the municipality’s logo and phone number, and a media article quotes a municipal employee referred to as “the city staffer overseeing the park’s creation”.\nOn March 11, 2019, Halifax moved for partial summary judgment of Annapolis’ claim, pursuant to r. 13 of the Nova Scotia Civil Procedure Rules. In its motion, Halifax sought the dismissal of Annapolis’ constructive taking claim and urged the motion judge to find that, as a matter of law, a constructive taking cannot result from Halifax refusing to amend the Planning Strategy and associated land use by-laws. Annapolis resisted the motion, arguing that its claim raises genuine issues of material fact requiring a trial.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nV. Analysis # A. Overview of the Law of Takings # It is useful to begin with a brief overview of the law of takings. Given the facts of this appeal, our focus is on expropriation through regulation — which, again, we refer to as a “constructive taking” in preference to other commonly applied terms such as “de facto” or “regulatory taking”, as in our view it more accurately captures the nature of the state action at issue and the effect on the landowner (see e.g., M. Lavoie, “Canadian Common Law and Civil Law Approaches to Constructive Takings: A Comparative Economic Perspective” (2010), 42 Ottawa L. Rev. 229).\nA “taking” is a “forcible acquisition by the Crown of privately owned property \u0026hellip; for public purposes” (K. Horsman and G. Morley, eds., Government Liability: Law and Practice (loose-leaf), at § 5:1). It may take the form of a constructive taking (effective appropriation of private property by a public authority exercising its regulatory powers), or a de jure taking (formal expropriation), by (in the case of land) taking title.\nTo be clear, not every instance of regulating the use of property amounts to a constructive taking. Governments and municipalities holding delegated provincial regulatory authority (Toronto (City) v. Ontario (Attorney General), 2021 SCC 34, at para. 2) validly regulate land in the public interest without effecting “takings”, properly understood (see Compliance Coal Corporation v. British Columbia (Environmental Assessment Office), 2020 BCSC 621, 13 L.C.R. (2d) 215, at para. 91). The line between a valid regulation and a constructive taking is crossed where the effect of the regulatory activity deprives a claimant of the use and enjoyment of its property in a substantial and unreasonable way, or effectively confiscates the property (Horsman and Morley, at § 5:2). Put simply, “in order for a Crown measure to effect a constructive taking of property, private rights in the property must be virtually abolished, leaving the plaintiff with ‘no reasonable use’ of the property” (Horsman and Morley, at § 5:13 (emphasis added)).\nA series of lower court judgments affirm that, in general, Canadian courts require a “total loss of the plaintiff’s interest in property for the Crown’s action to constitute a taking” (Horsman and Morley, at § 5:13; see also Lynch v. St. John’s (City), 2016 NLCA 35, 400 D.L.R. (4th) 62; Sun Construction Company Limited v. Conception Bay South (Town)2019 NLSC 102, 87 M.P.L.R. (5th) 256(N.L. S.C.) ). Courts have, therefore, dismissed claims for compensation where the regulation left the owner some reasonable use for the property (Genevieve Holdings Ltd. v. Kamloops (City)198842 M.P.L.R. 171 (B.C. Co. Ct.); Steer Holdings Ltd. v. Manitoba, [1992] 2 W.W.R. 558 (Man. Q.B.), aff’d (1992), 99 D.L.R. (4th) 61 (Man. C.A.); Purchase v. Terrace (City)199526 M.P.L.R. (2d) 126 (B.C.S.C.); Harvard Investments Ltd. v. Winnipeg (City), (1995), 129 D.L.R. (4th) 557 (Man. C.A.)).\nAt common law, taking of property by the state must be authorized by law, and triggers a presumptive right to compensation which can be displaced only by clear statutory language showing a contrary intention — that is, an intention not to compensate (see P. A. Warchuk, “Rethinking Compensation for Expropriation” (2015), 48 U.B.C. L. Rev. 655, at pp. 656 and 678-81). This was recognized in Attorney-General v. De Keyser’s Royal Hotel, [1920] A.C. 508 (H.L.), wherein Lord Atkinson stated: “The recognized rule for the construction of statutes is that, unless the words of the statute clearly so demand, a statute is not to be construed so as to take away the property of a subject without compensation” (p. 542).\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThis legal backdrop brings us to CPR, and its elaboration of the common law rule in the form of a two-part test for showing a constructive taking: “\u0026hellip; (1) an acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it, and (2) removal of all reasonable uses of the property \u0026hellip;” (para. 30 (emphasis added), citing Mariner, at p. 716; Manitoba Fisheries ; Tener ). The issues present in this appeal require us to consider the meaning of a “beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it” under the first part of that test. In bringing greater clarity to this aspect of the CPR test, we do not change the doctrine of constructive takings, but simply apply it to the facts of the present dispute. As we will explain, the Court in CPR did not use “beneficial interest” in the technical sense that it carries in the domain of equity. Rather, a “beneficial interest” is to be more broadly understood as an “advantage” — hence the Court’s coupling of “beneficial interest” with the phrase “or flowing from [the property]”. Clearly, if the interest acquired by the state can be one which flows from the property, what must be shown by the property owner can fall short of an actual acquisition by the state.\nFurther, we must also decide the relevance, if any, under the second part of the test of the public authority’s intended use of the land.\nB. “Beneficial Interest\u0026quot; # The Court of Appeal, it will be recalled, held that the first part of the test stated in CPR — the “acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it” — requires Annapolis to show that Halifax actually acquired the Lands. Deciding whether this is so requires that we give meaning to the expression “beneficial interest”, as it was used in CPR. In our view, that meaning is best appreciated by considering the authorities upon which CPR relied in stating that condition, and especially this Court’s decisions in Manitoba Fisheries and Tener . As we will explain, doing so reveals that actual acquisition is not necessary; rather, the obtaining by Halifax of an advantage in respect of the Lands suffices.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn our view, the foregoing jurisprudence — upon which the CPR test was expressly stated as resting — supports an understanding of “beneficial interest” as concerned with the effect of a regulatory measure on the landowner, and not with whether a proprietary interest was actually acquired by the government. Conversely, that same jurisprudence supports the view that “beneficial interest”, as that term appears in the first part of the test stated in CPR, refers not to actual acquisition of the equity that rests with the beneficial owner of property connoting rights of use and enjoyment, but to an “advantage” flowing to the state. We say this for two reasons.\nFirst, to require actual acquisition would collapse the distinction between constructive (de facto) and de jure takings — a distinction which CPR explicitly preserves (paras. 30-37). Simply put, if a constructive taking requires an actual taking, then it is no longer constructive. It follows that the Court of Appeal’s requirement of an actual acquisition of the Annapolis Lands cannot be necessary to satisfy the CPR test for a constructive taking.\nSecondly, interpreting “beneficial interest” broadly (as meaning a benefit or advantage accruing to the state) ensures CPR’s coherence to Manitoba Fisheries and Tener , neither of which understood “benefits” in the strict equitable sense of that term. Again, the references to those authorities in CPR demonstrate that CPR merely sought to affirm, and not to alter, our law of constructive takings. This interpretation is supported by the explicit wording under the first part of the CPR test: “\u0026hellip; a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it \u0026hellip;” (para. 30 (emphasis added)). An interest flowing from the property affirms that a “beneficial interest” can be more broadly understood as an advantage, and need not be an actual acquisition.\nTo be clear, we are not “depart[ing] from precedent” (para. 111), as our colleagues contend. We aim to illuminate CPR, not overrule it. Our colleagues say that courts “have applied the CPR test without difficulty” (para. 112). With respect, this misses the point. The key question is whether the lower courts have applied the CPR test correctly. In our respectful view, many of them have not. Indeed, the Court of Appeal itself misapprehended the law in this case, by asserting that CPR requires an actual expropriation to establish a constructive taking. As we have explained, and as the authorities confirm, CPR — properly understood — trains the court’s eye on whether a public authority has derived an advantage, in effect, from private property, not on whether it has formally acquired a proprietary interest in the land. To hold otherwise would be to erase the long-standing distinction between de jure and de facto expropriation from Canadian law.\nAs a final observation, we acknowledge that, in addition to Manitoba Fisheries and Tener , the Court in CPR also cited to Mariner . But this does not affect our analysis. Mariner concerned the Province of Nova Scotia’s designation of privately owned land as a beach under a provincial statute that subjected it to stringent conservation regulations. When the Minister refused the respondents’ applications to build homes on the land, they sought a declaration that the Crown had expropriated their lands, entitling them to compensation. Cromwell J.A. (as he then was), writing for the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, held that the respondents’ loss of economic value did not amount to an advantage acquired by the provincial authority (see generally Mariner, at pp. 713-16).\nMariner illustrates that regulation alone will not satisfy the test for a constructive taking; there must be something more “beyond drastically limiting use or reducing the value of the owner’s property” (p. 716). When this threshold is crossed — that is, where all reasonable uses have been removed — a regulation may be, “in effect, confiscation” (p. 727 (emphasis added)). To be clear, Mariner does not stray from focussing on both the effect of the taking and the advantage acquired by the government, as required by this Court’s jurisprudence and affirmed in the test set out in CPR. Rather, and consistent with both Manitoba Fisheries and Tener , Mariner asked whether the effect of the regulation was to remove an interest in land (Mariner, at p. 722, referring to Tener ).\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn sum, we affirm that the test to show a constructive taking is that stated by CPR, properly understood. The reviewing court must decide: (1) whether the public authority has acquired a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it (i.e. an advantage); and (2) whether the state action has removed all reasonable uses of the property. This gives effect to this Court’s acknowledgement of a common law right to compensation where the two-part CPR test is satisfied. It accords with imperatives of justice and fairness, which underpin the court’s assessment of expropriation claims, and remedies situations where cases do not neatly fit within the expropriation legislative framework and would otherwise “fall between the cracks” (Warchuk, at pp. 686 and 690).\nTo this, we would add that, because the test focusses on effects and advantages, substance and not form is to prevail. A court deciding whether a regulatory measure effects a constructive taking must undertake a realistic appraisal of matters in the context of the specific case, including but not limited to:\na. The nature of the government action (i.e., whether it targets a specific owner or more generally advances an important public policy objective), notice to the owner of the restrictions at the time the property was acquired, and whether the government measures restrict the uses of the property in a manner consistent with the owner’s reasonable expectations;\nb. The nature of the land and its historical or current uses. Where, for example, the land is undeveloped, the prohibition of all potential reasonable uses may amount to a constructive taking. That said, a mere reduction in land value due to land use regulation, on its own, would not suffice; and\nc. The substance of the alleged advantage. The case law reveals that an advantage may take various forms. For example, permanent or indefinite denial of access to the property or the government’s permanent or indefinite occupation of the property would constitute a taking (Sun Construction , at para. 15). Likewise, regulations that leave a rights holder with only notional use of the land, deprived of all economic value, would satisfy the test. It could also include confining the uses of private land to public purposes, such as conservation, recreation, or institutional uses such as parks, schools, or municipal buildings.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nE. Application # [\u0026hellip;]\n(1) Halifax’s Alleged Acquisition of a Beneficial Interest in the Annapolis Lands # First, it is disputed whether Halifax is promoting the Annapolis Lands as a public park, for instance by encouraging public use and holding them out as a park, as Annapolis alleges. This disputed fact is material because, if proven, it would tend to support Annapolis’ claim that Halifax acquired a “beneficial interest” in the Lands, as we have explained it. Preserving a park in its natural state may constitute an advantage accruing to the state, thus satisfying the “acquisition” element of CPR.\nTo be clear, we reject the Court of Appeal’s formalistic position that a public authority’s alleged encouragement and financial support of trespass can never amount to an acquisition of a beneficial interest. Several cases support the proposition that whether a public authority treats private lands as an extension of a public park is a key factor in assessing the acquisition requirement. For instance, in Benjamin, the Quebec Court of Appeal found that the City of Montréal’s knowing use of private land as a public park — entailing the installation of lampposts, a fence, and signage indicating the location of the “park” that included the subject lands — in conjunction with restrictive zoning, effectively constituted a “disguised expropriation” (paras. 65 and 82).\nSimilarly, in Dupras v. Ville de Mascouche, 2020 QCCS 2538, the Quebec Superior Court held that the City had effectively expropriated the claimant’s lands by subjecting them to “conservation” zoning and treating them as if they were part of a public park. Notably, the City had (1) marked off trails, (2) added signage with park maps covering the subject land, (3) encouraged the public to use the lands on the park, and (4) taken out insurance to cover public recreational activities on the land (see paras. 137-40). The Quebec Court of Appeal affirmed the Superior Court’s reasoning and dismissed the respondent city’s cross-appeal on the finding of disguised expropriation (2022 QCCA 350, at paras. 27-40).\nA similar claim in Steer Holdings failed, but for reasons which distinguish it from the allegations here. In Steer Holdings , the Manitoba Court of Appeal held that no benefit was acquired where there was “no suggestion that people will be encouraged in any way to move from the nature park to the subject property” (p. 67). Moreover, the land was not adjacent to the provincial park. The Court of Appeal thus rejected the argument that the Province of Manitoba had effectively enlarged its park system.\nAs we have explained, and as the cases confirm, the doctrine of constructive takings looks to the effects of state action; it does not require a formal acquisition of a proprietary interest by the state. The absence of such a proprietary interest does not preclude the argument that, in effect, Halifax has functionally treated the Annapolis Lands as if they were a park for the benefit of the public. If proven, this fact would support Annapolis’ claim that Halifax acquired a beneficial interest in its property. It is, therefore, plainly material.\n(2) Halifax’s Alleged Removal of All Reasonable Uses of the Annapolis Lands # Second, it is disputed whether Halifax, by allegedly treating the Annapolis Lands as a public park, has eliminated all uses of the Lands except serviced development, which is conditional upon the approval of Annapolis’ secondary planning applications.\nThis disputed fact is material because, if proven, it may arguably support Annapolis’ claim that it has lost all reasonable uses of its property. This would leave Annapolis to shoulder the burden of holding the Lands as a public park indefinitely, while Halifax enjoys the advantage of having the Lands reserved for its own purposes without having to pay compensation. It is notable that the Court of Appeal, after observing that “Annapolis’ reasonable uses of its lands have not changed”, failed to identify a single reasonable possible use of the property (para. 92; see Lynch, at para. 63).\nFurther, the Court of Appeal’s reasoning — to which our colleagues subscribe — cuts against one of the core lessons from Mariner , being to look to “the actual application of the regulatory scheme as opposed simply to its potential for interference with the owner’s activities” (p. 718 (emphasis added)). In concluding that there had been no taking in the present case, the Court of Appeal leaned heavily on the fact that the zoning rules had not changed, such that Annapolis’ land use rights remained the same after the release of the 2006 Planning Strategy. But the Court of Appeal neglected to consider Halifax’s application of the regulatory scheme as alleged by Annapolis. Indeed, Manitoba Fisheries , Tener , and Mariner all stand for the proposition that a regulation does not per se eliminate all reasonable uses of property where it provides a mechanism for permits, exemptions, or licenses to allow activities that are otherwise prohibited. In such cases, it is not the regulation alone that effects a constructive taking, but the application of that regulation to the land, including the manner in which the public authority refuses to grant the permit, exemption, or license (see Manitoba Fisheries , at p. 103 (taking of the goodwill resulting from the refusal by the Crown corporation to grant a license or exemption for the export of fish); Tener, at pp. 564-65 (Crown’s notice denying a permit to conduct development work found to be an “expropriation” of the mineral rights)). In sum, “[w]hen \u0026hellip; the claim is that the impact of a regulatory scheme has, in effect, taken away all rights of ownership, it is not the existence of the regulatory authority that is significant, but its actual application to the lands” (Mariner, at p. 729 (emphasis in original)). Therefore, the Court of Appeal erred in focussing solely on the “longstanding zoning status quo for the Lands” (R.F., at para. 18) since the passing of the Halifax Mainland Land Use By-Law in 2006.\nAccording to Annapolis, Halifax has repeatedly refused to initiate the secondary planning process which could lead to the re-zoning of the Annapolis Lands. If Annapolis can prove at trial that Halifax is unlikely to ever grant secondary planning approval, this is clearly material to its constructive taking claim. In our view, all reasonable uses of land may be shown to have been eliminated where a permit needed to make reasonable use of the land is refused, such that the state has effectively taken away all rights of ownership.\nWe note our colleagues’ characterization of Halifax’s alleged conduct as a mere “refusal to up-zone” which did not affect the reasonable uses of the Annapolis Lands. Our colleagues say that Halifax’s alleged conduct “simply disappointed” Annapolis’ hopes of cashing in on a speculative investment (para. 145). For several reasons, we respectfully reject this view.\nFirst, Annapolis did not acquire the Lands as a “speculative bet” (para. 145). Annapolis acquired most of the Lands in 1956, slowly adding to its holdings over time. Crucially, Halifax did not regulate land use in the relevant area prior to 1982. In other words, nothing prevented Annapolis from developing the Lands when they were first acquired. The conduct alleged is therefore not a mere “refusal to up-zone”, as our colleagues say (para. 115). Annapolis originally had the right to use the Lands at its discretion. It now alleges that Halifax eliminated this right and thereby secured a public advantage without compensation.\nSecondly, and again with respect, our colleagues incorrectly characterize our position as an assertion that a “refusal to up-zone vacant land” is tantamount to a constructive taking (para. 151). A refusal to up-zone, standing alone, will not generally remove all reasonable uses of vacant land. As we have explained, Halifax’s alleged conduct in this case is more than a mere refusal to up-zone. Annapolis claims that Halifax has effectively transformed its Lands into a public park. We emphasize, however, that Halifax may defeat Annapolis’ constructive taking claim by showing a single reasonable use of the property.\nIn this regard, it is telling that our colleagues do not identify any reasonable use of the Annapolis Lands. The mere (theoretical) possibility for Annapolis to lease the lands is not indicative of any reasonable use of the property — as our colleagues implicitly recognize in discussing Benjamin. As they acknowledge, the City in Benjamin “render[ed] any use of the land practically impossible” (para. 139), despite the absence of any restrictions on leasing. In any event, it is not realistic to assert that Annapolis may lease lands which, according to its allegations, are already used as a public park by Halifax.\nMoreover, in most cases, a public authority will not benefit from a refusal to up-zone vacant land. As such, even if all reasonable uses of land are eliminated by a zoning refusal, the first element of the CPR test for a constructive taking would not ordinarily be met. Accordingly, we cannot agree with our colleagues that our approach “dramatically expands the potential liability of municipalities engaged in land use regulation” (para. 115). To the contrary, our approach is firmly rooted in the common law and does not encroach on the general rule that a refusal to up-zone does not itself effect a constructive taking.\nLastly, we reiterate that provincial legislatures remain free, as they always have been, to “alter the common law” in respect of constructive takings (CPR, at para. 37, referring to the immunity conferred by s. 569 of the Vancouver Charter) — by, in this case, immunizing Halifax by statute from the obligation to pay compensation for taking private property in the public interest.\nIn light of the foregoing, the Court of Appeal erred in striking Annapolis’ claim related to the alleged constructive taking. There are genuine issues of material fact to be tried.\nVI. Disposition # We would allow the appeal, set aside the Court of Appeal’s partial summary judgment order, and restore the motion judge’s order dismissing Halifax’s motion for partial summary judgment, with costs throughout. Annapolis’ claim against Halifax, in its entirety, may proceed to trial.\nKasirer, Jamal JJ. (dissenting) \u0026ndash; # I. Overview # We have had the advantage of reading the reasons of our colleagues Côté and Brown JJ. With respect for their views, we conclude that the appeal should be dismissed.\nThis Court summarized the test for a de facto (or constructive) taking at common law in its unanimous decision in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Vancouver (City) 2006 SCC 5, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 227 (“CPR”), at para. 30, per McLachlin C.J.:\nFor a de facto taking requiring compensation at common law, two requirements must be met: (1) an acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it, and (2) removal of all reasonable uses of the property (see Mariner Real Estate Ltd. v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General) (1999), 177 D.L.R. (4th) 696(N.S.C.A.), at p. 716; Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. v. The Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 101; and The Queen in Right of British Columbia v. Tener, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 533).\nAnnapolis Group Inc. has asked this Court to depart from this precedent. It urges the Court to allow its appeal from the order of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal granting partial summary judgment dismissing its claim against Halifax Regional Municipality for a de facto taking of its lands. Annapolis invited — and needs — this Court to depart from CPR for its claim to proceed to trial.\nOur colleagues Côté and Brown JJ. have accepted Annapolis’ invitation and propose to change the CPR precedent in two respects. We respectfully disagree with the changes they propose and how they apply the law in this case.\nFirst, we disagree with our colleagues’ view that the first element of the CPR test — which requires “an acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it” — should be replaced with the much broader notion of an “advantage”, whether or not “a proprietary interest was actually acquired by the government” (see paras. 4, 25, 27, 38, 40 and 44-45). Our colleagues’ reformulation involves an unwarranted departure from CPR and significantly expands the potential liability of public authorities when regulating land use in the public interest. In our view, this Court should retain the CPR test for a de facto taking, which insists that a proprietary interest be acquired. Courts across common law Canada have applied this test without difficulty.\nSecond, we disagree with our colleagues’ view that a public authority’s “intention” is a material fact in a claim for a de facto taking (para. 53). This is also an unwarranted departure from CPR and this Court’s prior jurisprudence. The material facts for a de facto taking claim concern the effects of the public authority’s regulatory activity, not its intention.\nHere, Annapolis’ de facto taking claim arises from Halifax’s refusal to “up-zone” (in French: “procéder à un rezonage pour usage plus intensif”) land — to re-zone to enlarge the permissible uses of land, in this case so that Annapolis may commercially develop the land for housing — in connection with about 1,000 acres of vacant and treed land owned by Annapolis (”Annapolis Lands”). Annapolis’ proposed use for commercial development is impermissible and has been impermissible for many years. Annapolis now alleges that a Halifax municipal council resolution in 2016 refusing to up-zone the land to permit development — a regular occurrence in municipalities across Canada — and Halifax’s alleged acts of trespass in encouraging the public to hike, canoe, and swim on the lands, give rise to claims for de facto taking, abuse of public office, and unjust enrichment.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAnnapolis’ core claim is that Halifax’s refusal to up-zone its land to permit residential development, along with the fact that Halifax acted deliberately to secure the advantage of using the Annapolis Lands as a public park, constitutes a de facto taking. However, a refusal to up-zone, in the circumstances of this case, cannot establish a de facto taking unless this Court departs from the common law requirements that Halifax has acquired a beneficial interest involving the property and that Halifax has removed all reasonable uses of the property. We decline to alter the settled law to allow Annapolis to proceed with its claim. We are respectfully of the view that by acceding to Annapolis’ plea to set aside this Court’s decision in CPR as a governing precedent, our colleagues’ opinion risks radically changing the complexion of municipal planning law by providing, in like up-zoning contexts, a windfall to developers who speculate at municipal taxpayers’ expense.\nII. Background # We take no issue with our colleagues’ summary of the factual background and the decisions below, but we wish to highlight the precise conduct of Halifax that Annapolis alleges constitutes a de facto taking: (1) refusing to up-zone the Annapolis Lands and to zone the lands as a park, and (2) encouraging the public to trespass.\nBetween the 1950s and 2014, Annapolis, a real estate development company, acquired the Annapolis Lands, consisting of about 1,000 acres of vacant and treed land. Annapolis hoped to develop the lands into residential communities and to sell the development for a profit. The Annapolis Lands — which are still vacant and treed — are next to the Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Lakes Wilderness Area, a large wilderness area protected under the Wilderness Areas Protection Act, S.N.S. 1998, c. 27.\nIn 2006, Halifax adopted a “Regional Municipal Planning Strategy” as a policy statement to guide land development in the municipality. This policy, essentially a vision statement of long-term property development in the municipality, was adopted under the Municipal Government Act, S.N.S. 1998, c. 18, and the Halifax Regional Municipality Charter, S.N.S. 2008, c. 39 (”Halifax Charter”). Both statutes require Halifax to put in place a municipal planning strategy containing “statements of policy” to “guide the development and management of the municipality”, including “the future use, management and development of lands within the municipality” (Municipal Government Act, ss. 212 to 214; Halifax Charter, ss. 227 to 229). Both statutes also expressly provide that “[t]he adoption of a municipal planning strategy does not commit the council to undertake any of the projects suggested in it” (Municipal Government Act, s. 217(2); Halifax Charter, s. 232(2) (emphasis added to both statutes)).\nUnder Halifax’s 2006 Regional Municipal Planning Strategy, about a third of the Annapolis Lands are designated “Urban Settlement”, which means they could be developed for serviced residential communities within 25 years. The remaining two-thirds of the Annapolis Lands are designated “Urban Reserve”, which means they could be developed after 25 years. Serviced development on the Annapolis Lands cannot occur, however, unless Halifax adopts a municipal resolution authorizing a “secondary planning process” and amends its zoning by-law to allow residential development.\nStarting in 2007, Annapolis urged Halifax to take these legislative measures to permit Annapolis to build residential communities on the lands. Halifax has consistently refused to do so, preferring to maintain the status quo. In 2016, Halifax adopted a municipal resolution stating that it would not authorize a secondary planning process on the Annapolis Lands “at this time”.\nThe 2016 municipal resolution refusing to up-zone the lands to permit development led to this litigation. In 2017, Annapolis sued Halifax for over $120 million for the alleged de facto taking of its lands and for abuse of public office and unjust enrichment.\nOnly the de facto taking claim is in issue on this appeal. Annapolis alleges that Halifax refused to up-zone the lands because it intends to use them for a park and that Halifax has encouraged the public to trespass on the lands to hike, canoe, and swim. Annapolis also claims that Halifax has refused to zone the lands as a park because it would otherwise have a statutory obligation to buy the lands within a year (see Municipal Government Act, s. 222; Halifax Charter, s. 237). Annapolis’ key allegations of de facto taking are set out in its amended statement of claim, dated March 22, 2017, at paras. 111-12:\n[Halifax] has de facto expropriated the Annapolis Lands for public use as a park. [Halifax] has delayed and obstructed all of Annapolis’ attempts to develop the Annapolis Lands, and likewise, has deliberately avoided expressly zoning the Annapolis Lands to avoid its compensation obligation. In doing so, it has obtained the use of the Annapolis Lands as a public park, and has deprived Annapolis of any use of the Annapolis Lands.\nIndeed, [Halifax] encourages members of the public to use the Annapolis Lands as a park. In addition to a variety of other outdoor activities, members of the public hike, cycle, canoe, camp, and swim on the Annapolis Lands as if [Halifax] held the Annapolis Lands as a park.\n(A.R., vol. I, at p. 146)\nAs we will explain, none of these pleaded acts, alone or in combination, amount to a de facto taking.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIII. Analysis # [\u0026hellip;]\nOur colleagues’ reformulation of the acquisition requirement and departure from CPR as precedent has significant ramifications. It dramatically expands the potential liability of municipalities engaged in land use regulation in the public interest and throws into question the settled law that a refusal to up-zone is not a de facto taking.\nFor example, in Tener, at pp. 557 and 564, Estey J. affirmed that “[o]rdinarily, in this country, \u0026hellip; compensation does not follow zoning either up or down\u0026hellip;. The imposition of zoning regulation and the regulation of activities on lands \u0026hellip; add nothing to the value of public property.”\nSimilarly, in Mariner, at pp. 713 and 734, Cromwell J.A. stated that “[i]t is settled law \u0026hellip; that the regulation of land use which has the effect of decreasing the value of the land is not an expropriation\u0026hellip;. [O]rdinarily compensation does not follow zoning either up or down\u0026hellip;. Development freezes have consistently been held not to give rise to rights of compensation”.\nThis settled law, which our colleagues propose now to set aside, was helpfully summarized by E. C. E. Todd in The Law of Expropriation and Compensation in Canada (2nd ed. 1992), at pp. 22-23:\nBy the imposition, removal or alteration of land use controls a public authority may dramatically increase, or decrease, the value of land by changing the permitted uses which may be made of it. In such a case, in the absence of express statutory provision to the contrary an owner is not entitled to compensation or any other remedy notwithstanding that subdivision approval or rezoning is refused or development is blocked or frozen pursuant to statutory planning powers in order, for example, to facilitate the future acquisition of the land for public purposes. [Footnotes omitted.]\nSee also S. E. Hamill, “Common Law Property Theory and Jurisprudence in Canada” (2015), 40 Queen’s L.J. 679, at p. 703 (”So long as the owner can continue to use their property as they always have, they cannot be considered to have suffered a legally recognizable loss”); S. M. Makuch, N. Craik and S. B. Leisk, Canadian Municipal and Planning Law (2nd ed. 2004), at p. 212 (”the courts would be well advised to remain true to their traditional approach, which is in keeping with the general assumptions of no compensation for planning decisions and of allowing municipalities to allocate the benefits and burdens of planning”).\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIV. Application # [\u0026hellip;]\nNeither Halifax’s 2016 municipal resolution refusing to up-zone the Annapolis Lands nor Halifax’s alleged acts of encouraging the public to trespass raises any genuine issue of material fact that Halifax has acquired a beneficial interest in the lands or flowing from them.\nThe municipal resolution merely preserved the status quo by refusing to allow lands which have always been vacant and treed and situated next to a protected wilderness area to be developed into serviced residential communities. It is of no moment that the 2006 Regional Municipal Planning Strategy, as a statement of policy, stated that a possible future use of the Annapolis Lands included serviced residential development. Both the Municipal Government Act and the Halifax Charter confirm that “[t]he adoption of a municipal planning strategy does not commit the council to undertake any of the projects suggested in it” (Municipal Government Act, s. 217(2); Halifax Charter, s. 232(2)).\nHalifax’s adoption of a municipal resolution refusing to up-zone the lands also cannot be a basis for a de facto taking claim because the resolution did not result in Halifax acquiring any proprietary interest in the lands. As this Court held in CPR, at para. 33, a mere assurance that land will be used or developed in accordance with a municipality’s vision, without precluding historical or current uses of the land, is “not the sort of benefit” that can meet the acquisition requirement. This is why the common law has consistently held that a refusal to up-zone is not actionable as a de facto taking. Our colleagues claim, at para. 64, that “[p]reserving a park in its natural state may constitute an advantage accruing to the state”, but this flouts CPR’s insistence that the public authority must have acquired a proprietary interest. A mere “advantage” does not suffice. Respectfully, our colleagues’ expansive approach to what constitutes a de facto taking departs from precedent and would result in CPR being decided differently.\nWe also respectfully disagree with our colleagues’ suggestion, at para. 65, that Halifax’s alleged encouragement of trespass changes this conclusion. For example, at the hearing of the appeal, Annapolis insisted that Halifax has distributed promotional material encouraging people to hike at Fox Lake, which is within the Annapolis Lands. Annapolis claimed that this was an example of Halifax’s “use [of] the Annapolis Lands as a Regional Park” (outline of argument, at para. 5, in condensed book, at p. 2). We disagree. A public authority does not and cannot acquire a proprietary interest by encouraging others to trespass. If these allegations were made out at trial, Halifax might well expose itself to liability on some other basis. But this allegation cannot ground a claim for a de facto taking.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nEven if Annapolis could establish that Halifax has acquired a beneficial interest in the Annapolis Lands or flowing from them, it cannot meet the second requirement of the test for a de facto taking: there is no genuine issue of material fact that Halifax has deprived Annapolis of all reasonable uses of its lands. This in itself is fatal to Annapolis’ appeal given that the two requirements in CPR are cumulative.\nThis second element of the CPR test must be assessed “not only in relation to the land’s potential highest and best use, but having regard to the nature of the land and the range of reasonable uses to which it has actually been put” (CPR, at para. 34, quoting Mariner, at p. 717). When “a regulatory regime is imposed on land, its actual application in the specific case must be examined, not the potential, but as yet unexploited, range of possible regulation” (Mariner, at p. 718 (underlining added)). Confinement to uneconomic uses is insufficient (CPR, at paras. 8 and 27-31). Loss of virtually all economic value is also insufficient (Mariner, at pp. 714 and 719-27).\nIn CPR, for example, this Court held that the City of Vancouver’s by-law did not remove all reasonable uses of the property because it did not prevent the landowner from using its land to operate a railway, the only use to which the land had ever been put during the history of the City (para. 34).\nThe situation here is indistinguishable. As the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal noted, at para. 14, “[t]he zoning of the Annapolis Lands has not changed since the adoption of the Land Use By-law in 2006.” The court added: “Annapolis has the same rights with respect to its lands that it had prior to Council’s resolution on September 6, 2016. Nothing has changed” (para. 91). The lands were vacant and treed when Annapolis acquired them, and they remain vacant and treed. Halifax’s refusal to up-zone the lands in 2016 did not deprive Annapolis of any reasonable uses of its lands. It simply disappointed Annapolis’ hope of developing them. Annapolis speculated that, one day, it would have that right. The company made a bet and lost. There is no principled basis for saying that Halifax and its taxpayers now have to guarantee that speculative bet. We therefore agree with the submission of Halifax’s counsel, that “[Annapolis] bought barren land with no rights to do anything more than that. The municipality is not the guarantor of their land speculation” (transcript, at p. 79).\nContrary to our colleagues’ suggestion at para. 72, Halifax has not taken Annapolis’ “right” to develop the lands. Annapolis claims that it had an unfettered right to develop the lands before they were first zoned in 1982. Yet Annapolis grounds its de facto taking claim in the proceedings before us in Halifax’s refusal to up-zone in 2016 — which, as already noted, did not affect the zoning of the lands or Annapolis’ rights. Indeed, our colleagues acknowledge that the zoning has not changed since 2006 (para. 7). The potential permissible uses of the lands before 1982 are thus irrelevant to Annapolis’ claim.\nWe therefore agree with the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, at para. 92: “\u0026hellip; the lands and the reasonable uses to which Annapolis can put them remain exactly as they have been for many years”. This responds to our colleagues’ criticism that the Court of Appeal “failed to identify a single reasonable possible use of the property” (para. 70; see also para. 74). The lands remain vacant and treed and are zoned exactly as before. Further, as counsel for Halifax conceded during oral argument, subject to the current zoning Annapolis can lease the lands (transcript, at p. 72), just as CPR could in CPR (CPR, at para. 34). We note, too, that confinement of the land to uneconomic uses does not in itself establish a de facto taking (see CPR, at paras. 8 and 34; Horsman and Morley, at § 5:13).\nIn our respectful view, there is no basis in the record for our colleagues to assert that “it is disputed whether Halifax, by allegedly treating the Annapolis Lands as a public park, has eliminated all uses of the Lands except serviced development, which is conditional upon the approval of Annapolis’ secondary planning applications” (para. 69 (emphasis added)). Halifax did not eliminate or remove any reasonable use of the property. It simply refused to up-zone the lands to allow for residential development.\nOur colleagues nevertheless claim, at para. 76, that “it is telling that [Kasirer and Jamal JJ.] do not identify any reasonable use of the Annapolis Lands” (emphasis in original). Respectfully, this illustrates how our colleagues have changed the law. First, our colleagues evaluate the reasonable uses of the lands from the perspective of a commercial property developer, even though our law has never required that the “use” be confined to those of one class of landowner. Second, the removal requirement insists not merely that there be no reasonable uses, but also that they have been removed by the public authority. The issue is whether there has been a de facto taking by the public authority. Annapolis cannot show that Halifax removed any reasonable uses. Nor, in any event, is there any legal impediment to Annapolis leasing the lands.\nOur colleagues respond to the zoning and uses of the Annapolis Lands having not changed with the suggestion that this ignores “Halifax’s application of the regulatory scheme as alleged by Annapolis” (para. 71 (emphasis in original)). Our colleagues assert that “[i]f Annapolis can prove at trial that Halifax is unlikely to ever grant secondary planning approval, this is clearly material to its constructive taking claim” (para. 72 (emphasis in original)). We respectfully disagree. As a matter of proof, we do not see how Annapolis can prove a negative, particularly one involving a future fact.\nMore importantly, even if Annapolis could somehow show that Halifax will never up-zone the lands, that could not establish that Annapolis has lost all reasonable uses of those lands. The lands have never been used for serviced development — they have always been vacant and treed. Our colleagues’ assertion amounts to saying that a refusal to up-zone vacant land can give rise to a de facto taking merely if all “potential reasonable uses” are prohibited (para. 45 (emphasis in original)). That would upset the settled law reflected in Manitoba Fisheries , Tener , Mariner , and CPR, and it would eliminate Halifax’s statutory and common law protection from liability for refusing to up-zone. In CPR, this Court specifically noted that removal of all reasonable uses of the land must be assessed in relation to both its potential uses as well as the “nature of the land and the range of reasonable uses to which it has actually been put” (para. 34, quoting Mariner, at p. 717). That statement applies equally in this case.\nC. Conclusion # We conclude that there is no genuine issue of material fact that Halifax has acquired a beneficial interest in the Annapolis Lands or flowing from them or that Halifax has deprived Annapolis of all reasonable uses of its lands. In view of the settled law, the pleading of a de facto taking has no real chance of success. Like the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, we would grant partial summary judgment dismissing the claim for de facto taking.\nV. Disposition # We would dismiss the appeal with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed.\n"},{"id":69,"href":"/casebook/relationships/asher/","title":"Asher v Whitlock ","section":"Chapter 1","content":"At the trial before Cockburn, C.J., at the last Bedfordshire Spring Assizes, the following facts appeared in evidence. About Michaelmas, in the year 1842, Thomas Williamson inclosed from the waste of a manor a piece of land by the side of the highway; and in 1850, he inclosed more land adjoining, and built a cottage; the whole being the land as described and claimed in the writ. He occupied the whole till his death in 1860. By his will he devised the whole property, describing it as \u0026ldquo;a cottage and garden, in Keysoe Row, in which I now dwell,\u0026rdquo; to his wife Lucy Williamson, for and during so much only of her natural life as she might remain his widow and unmarried; and from and after her decease, or second marriage, whichever event might first happen, to his only child Mary Ann Williamson, in fee. After the death of Thomas Williamson, his widow remained in possession with the daughter, and in April, 1861, married the defendant; and from that time they all three resided on the property till the death of the daughter, aged eighteen years, in February, 1863. On her death, the defendant and his wife, the widow of the testator, continued to reside on the premises; the widow died in May, 1863, and the defendant still continued to occupy.\nThe female plaintiff is the heir-at-law of the testator\u0026rsquo;s daughter Mary Ann Williamson. The writ was issued 11th of April, 1865.\nThese facts being undisputed, the Chief Justice directed a verdict for the plaintiff for the whole of the property claimed; with leave to move to enter the verdict for the defendant, on the ground that the testator had no devisable interest in any part of the property.\nA rule nisi was afterwards obtained to enter the verdict for the defendant, on the ground that no title in the plaintiffs was shewn to either portion of the land enclosed.\nCockburn C.J. — # I am of opinion that this rule should be discharged. The defendant, on the facts, is in this dilemma; either his possession was adverse, or it was not. If it was not adverse to the devisee of the person who inclosed the land, and it may be treated as a continuance of the possession which the widow had and ought to have given up, on her marriage with the defendant, then, as she and the defendant came in under the will, both would be estopped from denying the title of the devisee and her heir-at-law. But assuming the defendant\u0026rsquo;s possession to have been adverse, we have then to consider how far it operated to destroy the right of the devisee and her heir-at-law. Mr. Merewether was obliged to contend that possession acquired, as this was, against a rightful owner, would not be sufficient to keep out every other person but the rightful owner. But I take it as clearly established, that possession is good against all the world except the person who can shew a good title; and it would be mischievous to change this established doctrine. In Doe v. Dyeball one year\u0026rsquo;s possession by the plaintiff was held good against a person who came and turned him out; and there are other authorities to the same effect. Suppose the person who originally inclosed the land had been expelled by the defendant, or the defendant had obtained possession without force, by simply walking in at the open door in the absence of the then possessor, and were to say to him, “You have no more title than I have, my possession is as good as yours,” surely ejectment could have been maintained by the original possessor against the defendant.\nAll the old law on the doctrine of disseisin was founded on the principle that the disseisor\u0026rsquo;s title was good against all but the disseisee. It is too clear to admit of doubt, that if the devisor had been turned out of possession he could have maintained ejectment. What is the position of the devisee? There can be no doubt that a man has a right to devise that estate, which the law gives him against all the world but the true owner. Here the widow was a prior devisee, but durante viduitate only, and as soon as the testator died, the estate became vested in the widow; and immediately on the widow\u0026rsquo;s marriage the daughter had a right to possession; the defendant however anticipates her, and with the widow takes possession. But just as he had no right to interfere with the testator, so he had no right against the daughter, and had she lived she could have brought ejectment; although she died without asserting her right, the same right belongs to her heir. Therefore I think the action can be maintained, inasmuch as the defendant had not acquired any title by length of possession. The devisor might have brought ejectment, his right of possession being passed by will to his daughter, she could have maintained ejectment, and so therefore can her heir, the female plaintiff. We know to what extent encroachments on waste lands have taken place; and if the lord has acquiesced and does not interfere, can it be at the mere will of any stranger to disturb the person in possession? I do not know what equity may say to the rights of different claimants who have come in at different times without title; but at law, I think the right of the original possessor is clear. On the simple ground that possession is good title against all but the true owner, I think the plaintiff is entitled to succeed, and that the rule should be discharged.\nMellor J. — # I am of the same opinion. It is necessary to distinguish between the case of the true owner and that of a person having no title. The fact of possession is prima facie evidence of seisin in fee. The law gives credit to possession unless explained; and Mr. Merewether, in order to succeed, ought to have gone on and shewn the testator\u0026rsquo;s title to be bad, as that he was only tenant at will, but this he did not do. In Doe v. Dyeball possession for a year only was held sufficient against a person having no title. In Doe v. Barnard the plaintiff did not rely on her own possession merely, but shewed a prior possession in her husband, with whom she was unconnected in point of title. Here the first possessor is connected in title with the plaintiffs; for there can be no doubt that the testator\u0026rsquo;s interest was devisable. In the common case of proving a claim to landed estate under a will, proof of the will and of possession or receipt of rents by the testator is always prima facie sufficient, without going on to shew possession for more than twenty years. I agree with the Lord Chief Justice in the importance of maintaining that possession is good against all but the rightful owner.\nLUSH, J., concurred.\nRule discharged.\n"},{"id":70,"href":"/casebook/shelter/bamberger/","title":"Bamberger v Vancouver","section":"Chapter 4","content":" Kirchner J. — # I. INTRODUCTION # In 1984, an encampment of some 60 tents was established at the site of what would become CRAB Park at Portside in Vancouver. The encampment was a protest designed to pressure government authorities into creating a public park at the site. The name of the park is taken from the acronym for the activist group—Create a Real Available Beach Committee—that envisioned the establishment of a waterfront public park in an area of the city short of green space. The community activism and the camp protest had its desired effect and, in 1987, CRAB Park at Portside (“CRAB Park” or the “Park”) was established as a Vancouver public park on federal port land leased by the City. Today, tents have returned to CRAB Park but not out of protest. Rather, the Park is the most recent of Vancouver parks in or near the Downtown Eastside to see an encampment of Vancouver residents who are experiencing homelessness. The camp emerged in May and June of 2021. Since then, the General Manager of Parks and Recreation (the “General Manager”), an appointee of the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation (the “Park Board” or the “Board”), has made two orders (the “Orders”), purportedly under the Park Board’s Parks Control By-law (the “Bylaw”), ordering the campers to leave the park. The validity and enforceability of those orders is at issue in these proceedings.\nThe first Order, made July 8, 2021, prohibits any overnight sheltering in CRAB Park. The second, made September 7, 2021, closes a portion of CRAB Park to all members of the public for the purposes of rehabilitating the Park from the damage said to be caused by the encampment. The closed area includes the only area within the Park where overnight sheltering was permitted prior to the July 8 Order.\nAs recognized by the seminal decision in Victoria (City) v. Adams, 2009 BCCA 563 [Adams BCCA], aff’g 2008 BCSC 1363 [Adams BCSC], where there are inadequate indoor shelter spaces to accommodate persons genuinely experiencing homelessness, those persons are entitled to erect overnight shelters in public parks as a matter of their constitutional right to life, liberty, and security of the person. This right is guaranteed by s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c. 11 [the Charter].\nOn March 31, 2021, the Park Board, together with Province of British Columba and the City of Vancouver, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) acknowledging that homelessness “continues to grow” in Vancouver and elsewhere. Despite efforts by various levels of government to create affordable housing and sheltering options, the Park Board concedes there are insufficient indoor shelter spaces in Vancouver to accommodate the city’s homeless population. However, it maintains there is adequate indoor space for those camping at CRAB Park.\nIn Vancouver and elsewhere, a line of cases has developed since Adams as tensions between governments and persons experiencing homelessness arise, and a balance is sought between the Charter right to shelter and municipal efforts to protect public access to parks. As Justice Skolrood said in Nanaimo (City) v. Courtoreille, 2018 BCSC 1629 at para. 42:\nAs these cases illustrate, and as is demonstrated on the evidence filed in this specific case, homelessness is a multi-faceted social problem with no one cause and for which there is no single or obvious solution. It is also an issue that engenders strong feelings, both on the part of homeless people and advocates who decry the lack of available services and housing options, and in local citizens and merchants who deal with the manifestations of homelessness on a daily basis.\nOn this occasion, the issue comes before the court by way of two competing petitions. The first is brought by Kerry Bamberger and Jason Hebert (the “Petitioners”), both of whom are currently experiencing homelessness and living in tents in CRAB Park. They seek judicial review of the two Orders. They argue both were made without according rights of procedural fairness to those sheltering in the Park and both are unreasonable because they are grounded in an unsupported conclusion that there are sufficient and appropriate indoor sheltering spaces to accommodate those sheltering in the Park.\nThe second petition, brought by the Park Board, seeks a statutory injunction to compel Ms. Bamberger, Mr. Hebert, and all other persons with notice to comply with the General Manager’s September 7, 2021 Order.\nThe Park Board further argues that even if the Orders are set aside on the Petitioners’ judicial review, the Court should still grant the statutory injunction to enjoin those sheltering in CRAB Park from doing so in daytime hours in contravention of the Bylaw.\nFor the reasons that follow, I have concluded the application for judicial review should be granted and the Orders should be set aside with the matter remitted back to the General Manager or the Park Board for reconsideration. In light of that conclusion, I will not grant the Park Board’s application for an injunction to compel compliance with the September 7, 2021 Order. Further, the Park Board’s application for an injunction to compel compliance with the Bylaw should be adjourned pending reconsideration of the Orders or sooner if there is a significant change in the circumstances of the encampment, including with respect to matters of health, safety or public nuisance.\nII. THE RIGHT TO SHELTER IN PUBLIC PARKS # In Adams BCSC, Madam Justice Ross found a Victoria bylaw prohibiting homeless persons from erecting temporary shelters in Victoria parks infringed their right to life, liberty, and security of the person, as guaranteed by s. 7 of the Charter. She found the number of homeless persons in Victoria far outnumbered the available shelter beds such that many of Victoria’s homeless were forced to sleep outside. Despite this, the city’s bylaw prohibited anyone from erecting temporary shelters, including tents, tarps, or even cardboard boxes, in public parks, leaving them exposed to serious and life-threatening conditions and depriving them of their dignity, independence, and ability to protect themselves.\nAfter a refinement of Ross J.’s order by the Court of Appeal, it was declared that the offending sections of Victoria’s Park Regulation Bylaw were “inoperative insofar and only insofar as they apply to prevent homeless people from erecting temporary overnight shelter in parks when the number of homeless people exceeds the number of available shelter beds in the City of Victoria”: Adams BCCA at para. 166.\nThe constitutional right as articulated in Adams was thus circumscribed in two respects: (1) the right is exercisable when the number of homeless outnumbered the available indoor sheltering spaces, and (2) the right to erect a temporary shelter is confined to overnight hours.\nSince Adams, many municipal bylaws and government actions that seek to limit or restrict the ability of persons experiencing homelessness to erect and maintain shelters have come under challenge in this court, including in: Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation v. Williams, 2014 BCSC 1926 [Williams]; Abbotsford (City) v. Shantz, 2015 BCSC 1909 [Shantz]; British Columbia v. Adamson, 2016 BCSC 584 [Adamson No. 1]; British Columbia v. Adamson, 2016 BCSC 1245 [Adamson No. 2]; Nanaimo (City) v. Courtoreille, 2018 BCSC 1629 [Courtoreille]; Vancouver Fraser Port Authority v. Brett, 2020 BCSC 876 [Brett]; and, most recently, Prince George (City) v. Stewart, 2021 BCSC 2089 [Stewart].\nThe basic constitutional right as framed in Adams has remained largely unchanged. However, it is now recognized that it is not just the number of available indoor sheltering spaces that frames the right but also whether those spaces are truly accessible to those sheltering in parks. In Shantz, for example, Hinkson C.J.S.C. stated:\nGiven the personal circumstances of the City’s homeless, the shelter spaces that are presently available to others in the City are impractical for many of the City’s homeless. They simply cannot abide by the rules required in many of the facilities that I have discussed above, and lack the means to pay the required rents at others.\nMore recently, in Stewart, Hinkson C.J.S.C. stated:\nIt is apparent that very few of the emergency shelter beds are low barrier, and it appears that many of the homeless persons in the City are ineligible to stay in at least some of the shelters. While the City contends that the availability of 81 shelter beds in the City is sufficient to house the encampment occupants, I am not satisfied that these shelter spaces are in fact accessible to all of the occupants of the encampments.\nThe question of sheltering in public parks during daytime hours has also arisen in the cases since Adams, but the jurisprudence, thus far, has not extended the s. 7 Charter right to include it, at least not expressly. In Shantz at para. 276, Hinkson C.J.S.C. found “there is a legitimate need for people to shelter and rest during the day and no indoor shelter in which to do so” but held that a “minimally impairing response to balancing that need with the interests of other users” of the parks would be to allow overnight sheltering between 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m.\nHowever, in Adamson No. 1 and Stewart, Hinkson C.J.S.C. declined to grant injunctions to close specific homeless encampments and made no specific qualification that those sheltering in the parks could only do so during overnight hours. In Adamson No. 1, Hinkson C.J.S.C. did not squarely address the issue of daytime sheltering but nor did he tailor a remedy to require the encampment to be removed at sunrise.\nIn Stewart, he addressed the issue more directly, noting at para. 73 that the closure of shelter spaces due to COVID-19 resulted in scores of people having nowhere to shelter “in either the daytime or the nighttime.” He observed that these persons did not remove their tents or vacate the encampment each morning. In declining to grant the injunction, at least in respect of one, he did not consider or grant a more limited injunction that would restrict sheltering to overnight hours. He took judicial notice of the fact that “Prince George can be very cold in the fall and winter, and that people with nowhere warm to stay must find ways of keeping warm to stay alive”: Stewart at para. 64.\nThus, while neither Adamson No. 1 nor Stewart purport to expand the scope of the constitutional right to daytime sheltering, it was not specifically enjoined in either case. […]\n[After assessing the evidence before the General Manager of Parks and Recreation, the Court found that their decision to issue the orders prohibiting overnight sheltering and closing a portion of the park we \u0026ldquo;unreasonable\u0026rdquo; (in the administrative law context) because they had an \u0026ldquo;insufficient evidentiary basis on which to reasonably conclude that there are \u0026lsquo;sufficient and appropriate indoor spaces\u0026rsquo; to shelter those in CRAB Park.\u0026rdquo; The Court found that \u0026ldquo;[t]here is no evidence to suggest the General Manager turned her mind to the specific needs of those sheltering in the Park or whether the available shelter spaces were suitable to their needs. As recognized by the jurisprudence since Adams, the suitability of available shelter spaces, in addition to the number of available spaces, is relevant to the constitutional right of sheltering in a public park.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Court then went on to consider the Park Board\u0026rsquo;s application for an injunction to comply with the city bylaw prohibiting daytime sheltering after 8:00AM.]\n(b) General Manager’s Discretion for Daytime Sheltering # Based on the evidence and the arguments presented by the Injunction Respondents, the daytime needs of at least some of those sheltering in the Park is a serious issue. The evidence shows that for some, daytime sheltering is a necessity or, at least decamping every morning and carrying their possessions throughout the day is a substantial hardship. For example:\nMs. Bamberger acknowledges she is supposed to pack up her tent and her belongings every day but estimates that, between her tent and personal possessions, she would have to carry at least 500 pounds of gear throughout the day. She deposes she cannot afford to rent a storage locker and her tent is too large and heavy to carry around. If she leaves her tent set-up at CRAB Park, it does not get touched, and she feels her belongings in the tent are safe under the watch of others in the camp. Mr. Manitopyes deposes that although he does not have many possessions, he cannot risk losing what he has. These include a warm double-layer shelter that is necessary for his safety as the weather gets cold. He states this shelter is too bulky to move to a storage locker during the day. Mr. Manitopyes is an artist who sells his art to earn some money. He is unable to carry his sculptures and carving supplies with him and is concerned they will get stolen if left somewhere unattended.\nMr. Randen has lived in many places on the streets and alleys of downtown Vancouver. He has moved around often and had to pack up his things every morning. He states it is exhausting and time-consuming to take down his tent every day and set it up again in a new place that evening. Mr. Dechaghadjian is 70-years-old. Prior to living in CRAB Park, and after unsuccessfully staying in an SRO and shelters, he was setting up and taking down his tent every day. With the arrival of fall, this became too much for him at his age. To protect his belongings from the rain, he needs to keep tarps up, and it is too physically demanding for him to set this up and take it down daily.\nThe experience of these deponents is not true of all those sheltering in CRAB Park. Others are evidently not so challenged in decamping in the morning. Andrew Don, the Lead Park Ranger for the Parks Board, deposes he attended at the Park on seven occasions in July and August. One of his Park Ranger SR Slips (essentially a written report of his attendance) records at least one person, whom he describes as a “model camper”, had packed up her tent and was “mobile”. Mr. Don states in his Slip “if everyone in the park was as punctual as her with packing up, and as neat and tidy as she was, there would be no issues.” Mr. Don recorded others who were also packing up tents. Other Rangers report fairly successful efforts, prior to the end of June, in having campers pack up their tents in the morning.\nThe evidence also suggests some persons sheltering in the Park have access to suitable indoor living or sheltering spaces but are either showing support for those in the camp or prefer to be in the Park. Thus, while there is evidence of true hardship for some in complying with the daytime prohibition, it is not universal.\nDespite these exceptions, I am satisfied the requirement to decamp each morning poses a substantial hardship on some of those sheltering in CRAB Park. An injunction compelling everyone to decamp each morning would truly be a “blunt instrument” that will capture those for whom a more nuanced approach might be called for.\nAs I have discussed, under subsections 11B(b) and (c) of the Bylaw, the General Manager has the discretion to designate areas within a park for daytime sheltering. In reconsidering the July 8 and September 7 Orders, the General Manager should be open to considering all aspects of her discretion to deal with the CRAB Park encampment “in a positive and compassionate way” as contemplated by the MOU. The General Manager may well find it appropriate or necessary to invoke this provision to accommodate those CRAB Park campers who face true hardship in decamping each morning. I am not saying she is required to exercise this discretion or to exercise it in a particular way, but to date she appears not to have considered it as a potential tool to break the chain of non-compliance with the Bylaw.\nThe Park Board does not have a constitutional duty to provide storage facilities for daytime use by those experiencing homelessness. Nor does the constitutional law, at least to date, compel the Board to permit daytime sheltering. However, the Park Board, through its Bylaw, has seen fit to give the General Manager a tool to allow daytime sheltering, presumably to accommodate genuine needs where they might exist. Granting the Park Board an injunction at this stage, before the General Manager reconsiders the Orders, may imply that a daytime sheltering option need not be seriously contemplated as part of that reconsideration.\nClearly there is a persistent issue with ongoing use of public parks for daytime sheltering. The affidavits in this case suggest some reasons for why this might be the case. Perhaps at the end of the day an injunction will be the only way or the best way to address the issue. However, at this stage, I am not persuaded it is in the public interest to risk the relocation of the encampment to another park where it will present a greater disturbance to the larger community, at least before the General Manager or the Park Board has considered the full range of options under the Bylaw to address the issue.\n[The Court adjourned the Park Board\u0026rsquo;s application for an injunction pending the Board\u0026rsquo;s a reconsideration of the orders based on the Court\u0026rsquo;s conclusion that these orders were unreasonable.]\n"},{"id":71,"href":"/casebook/title/basic-estates/","title":"Basic Estates and Future Interests","section":"Chapter 3","content":"We will begin by examining two possessory estates—the fee simple absolute and the life estate—and two future interests \u0026hellip; —the reversion and the remainder.\nThe Fee Simple Absolute # The fee simple absolute is the most complete interest in land that the law will recognize. When we say that “O owns Greenacre without any further qualification, what we actually mean is that O owns a presently possessory fee simple absolute in Greenacre. The key distinguishing characteristic of the fee simple absolute is that it has no inherent end—it is an estate of indefinite duration. It is descendible, devisable, and alienable inter vivos; so it can be transferred to a new owner, but it cannot be destroyed. At most, it can be carved up into lesser estates and interests for a while, and we will spend most of the rest of this chapter understanding how that happens.\nAt common law, as previously noted, the fee simple absolute was created by the formula: “to A and his heirs.” That formula still works, but in modern usage it is sufficient to simply say “to A,” and the use of such language in a conveyance from the owner of a fee simple absolute will be presumed to create a fee simple absolute in A.\nThe Life Estate # The life estate is just what it sounds like: an estate that confers a right to possession for the life of its owner. The owner of a life estate is referred to as a life tenant. The life estate terminates by operation of law upon the owner’s death (i.e., it ceases to exist). It is created by the formula: “to A for life.” Because it must by definition end—we all have to die sometime—any land held by a life tenant must also be subject to a future interest in some other person.\n[…]\nThe Reversion # […] Consider what happens when A, owning a life estate in Greenacre, dies. A’s life estate terminates by operation of law; it simply ceases to exist and disappears. Who “owns” Greenacre now? It seems obvious that somebody must have a right to possession of the land, but it seems equally obvious that whoever that somebody is, they had no right to possession before A died. Whoever they are, during the term of A’s life estate they must have held an interest that would entitle them to take possession at some point in the future (that is, a future interest).\nThere are two candidates for such an interest. We will begin with the most basic: the reversion. Suppose that O, owning a fee simple absolute in Greenacre, conveys Greenacre “to A for life,” and says nothing more? What is the legal effect of this grant?\nBased on the formula we just learned, it should be clear that A receives a life estate in Greenacre. But what other effects does the grant have on the legal rights of the parties? Think about the interest O held prior to the conveyance: the fee simple absolute. Remember that a fee simple absolute is an interest of infinite duration—it never ends. So when O starts with a possessory interest of infinite duration, and then gives away a life estate—whose duration is limited by a human lifespan—to A, something was left over. Specifically, O never gave away the right to possession of Greenacre from the day of A’s death to the end of time. Whether meaning to or not, O gave away less of an interest in Greenacre than what he owned, meaning he still holds some interest. We call this type of interest—the residual interest left over when a grantor gives away less than they have—a retained interest.\nThis retained interest can’t entitle O to possession during A’s life—A has the exclusive right to possession as the life tenant. So O’s interest must be a future interest during the term of A’s life estate: an interest that will entitle O to possession after the natural termination of the life estate. As we discussed in the example of the lease, we call this kind of future interest a reversion. It is a retained interest in the grantor—created when a grantor conveys less than his entire interest—that will become possessory by operation of law upon the natural termination of the preceding estate. Colloquially, we say that Greenacre “reverts” to O. In some opinions, you will see the holder of a reversion referred to as a “reversioner.”\nA reversion can of course also be created explicitly, for example, if O conveys Greenacre “to A for life, then to O.” In this case, O has explicitly created a life estate in A followed by a reversion in O.\nThe Remainder # A remainder is a type of future interest created in someone other than the grantor. The distinguishing characteristic of the remainder is that—like a reversion—it cannot cut short or divest any possessory estate. (We will later encounter other future interests that can.) A remainder simply “remains,” sitting around and waiting for the natural termination of the preceding possessory estate (be it a life estate or a lease), at which point the remainder will become possessory by operation of law. Suppose that O, owning a fee simple absolute in Greenacre, conveys Greenacre “to A for life, and then to B.” Again, A would have a life estate, but now O has also affirmatively created a future interest in B. Because the future interest is created in someone other than the grantor, it isn’t a reversion. And because it cannot cut short A’s life estate (note the “and then” language), it must therefore be a remainder. Due to the persistence of dated gendered terms in legal discourse, you will often see the holder of a remainder referred to as a “remainderman,” even today, regardless of that person’s gender.\n"},{"id":72,"href":"/casebook/title/beals/","title":"Beals v Nova Scotia (AG)","section":"Chapter 3","content":" Bodurtha J. — # [\u0026hellip;]\nThe Community Land Titles Clarification Act, the predecessor to the LTCA, was assented to on March 18, 1964.

Ass. (4 March 1964) at 887-888 (Hon. W. S. Kennedy Jones)]\nThese brief comments are the only contemporaneous information available as to the purpose of the legislation.\nThe current Land Titles Clarification Act contains many of the same provisions as the Community Land Titles Clarification Act. It is clear from Hansard that the Act was intended to provide a simpler and less expensive means for clarifying title in areas where “there is a lack of development which can be traced to confusion or obscurity in titles”. What is unclear from the debates, however, is how these areas came to exist. The only hint is in the comment by the Honourable W.S. Kennedy Jones that his interest in the legislation was as chairman of the Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights (the predecessor to the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission). The applicant attempted to fill in this information gap by including excerpts from various secondary sources in his brief. These sources include: (1) a Masters of Arts thesis submitted to Dalhousie University in 2006 by Erica Colter entitled A State of Affairs Most Uncommon: Black Nova Scotians and the Stanfield Government’s Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights, 1959-1967; (2) an article by Lindsay Van Dyk entitled Shaping a Community, Black Refugees in Nova Scotia, available on the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 website; (3) a report prepared for the United Nations Human Rights Council by the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent setting out its findings following a visit to Canada in October 2016; and, (4) a report prepared by then Schulich School of Law student Angela Simmonds entitled This Land is Our Land: African Nova Scotian Voices from the Preston Area Speak Up (August 19, 2014). These sources discuss the experiences of black migrants who settled in Nova Scotia in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the continued impact of those experiences on subsequent generations of African Nova Scotians. Some also address how the LTCA has been implemented since its enactment. The respondent takes the position that these materials should not be considered by the court because they were not before the decision maker, nor were they the subject of a successful motion to admit fresh evidence. At the same time, however, counsel for the respondent conceded during argument that “it would be important for the Minister to be aware and understand the circumstances with respect to individuals living in these land clarification areas, certainly”.\nIt is helpful to examine the contested sources more closely. In her Masters thesis, Ms. Colter explains that black settlers arrived in Nova Scotia in three main groups — the Loyalists (1783-1785), the Maroons (1796), and the refugees of the War of 1812 (1813-1815). These settlers arrived in Nova Scotia under the pretence of offers of generous land grants from the British government. Unlike their white counterparts who typically received at least 100 acres of fertile land, black families were given ten-acre lots of poor-quality land. That land was segregated from the lands given to white families. In addition, while white settlers were given deeds to their land, black settlers were given “tickets of location” and “licenses of occupation”. Without legal title to their land, black settlers could not sell or mortgage their property, or legally pass it down to their descendants upon their death. Although a limited number of land titles were eventually issued in Preston, and some settlers were able to purchase land, most black families never attained clear title to their land. Lack of clear title and the segregated nature of their land triggered a cycle of poverty for African Nova Scotian families that persisted for generations:\nIf blacks had attained legal ownership of their land, this would have afforded them a substantially helpful financial asset. Without this asset, blacks held little collateral and therefore had great difficulty making financial advancements; while many whites turned their land grants into successful agricultural holdings and pursued other business interests, blacks struggled to survive. Such financial hardships supported a cycle of poverty that soon included a failing or non-existent education system. Blacks seeking an education through secular schools were challenged by the Nova Scotia School Act of 1811 which virtually denied access of education to poor communities. The Act stated that the government would only fund a school after the community built a schoolhouse, hired a teacher, and raised a requisite amount of money. If these conditions were not first in place, the government would not provide the community with funds for the building costs or provide further, ongoing support for the school. Most black communities were too poor to initiate such arrangements and therefore the members of the community could not access an education through this manner. An educated black community might have broken or eased this cycle of poverty, but unfortunately, most black regions could not end the cycle under these circumstances. Until 1954, issues of legal school segregation and discrimination persisted in Nova Scotia; certain black regions went years without schools as qualified teachers were not available or were not willing to accept the small salaries offered.\n[Colter, Erica. A State of Affairs Most Uncommon: Black Nova Scotians and the Stanfield Government’s Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights, 1959-1967 (Master of Arts, Dalhousie University, 2006), at pp. 19-20]\nThe isolated nature of rural black communities was accompanied by a lack of community development. Ms. Colter writes at p. 23:\nLife for black Nova Scotians by the 1960s, therefore, was still difficult, and blacks continued to face challenges similar to those faced by the early Loyalists, Maroons, and Refugees. The mid twentieth century marked a turning point in black history, however, as black problems began to gain wider attention. Urban communities, such as Africville, had long been recognized as a dire problem, but black communities in Nova Scotia’s rural areas began to share Africville’s notoriety.\nLife was worse for rural blacks as their isolation had led them to be forgotten by urban dwellers and government officials. Blacks in both urban and rural areas tended to live closely together, but the urban-living blacks frequently lived in areas also inhabited by whites. Black communities in rural areas were usually segregated and remote, and this isolation often was accompanied by an absence of typical community developments such as water, sewage, sanitation, garbage removal, road improvements, and other related services regularly provided in white or mixed communities. When blacks first arrived in the eighteenth century, the public’s initial response of benevolence and financial assistance was short-lived. This attention waned, and black communities remained forgotten until the improved communication systems and better roads of the 1950s and 1960s, both initiatives of Stanfield’s government, uncovered the state of these remote communities and public interest and concern returned. Stanfield recognized that, contrary to the long-held belief that black poverty was a black problem, “their problems have been exposed, and even more important, are recognized as problems of the whole community.” (citing Gwendolyn Shand, Adult Education Among the Negroes of Nova Scotia (Halifax: Institute of Public Affairs, Dalhousie University, 1961) at p. 3.)\nIn 1962, Premier Robert Stanfield created the Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights (ICHR). It was charged with giving immediate attention to housing, education and employment issues faced by African Nova Scotians. Ms. Colter reviewed the minutes of ICHR meetings as part of her research. In relation to land titles, she notes at p. 98:\nIn the 1960s, blacks were encountering discrimination and confusion over land titles. Many blacks were without documentation proving ownership of their land, even though the land had stayed within a family for generations. Clear titles would have helped blacks who were in the midst of relocation and improvement projects; as well, proof of land ownership would have increased a black family’s livelihood. Without a clear title, a family would be unable to sell or lease the land, or even to use the property as collateral to secure credit.\nStanfield’s government recognized this concern, and one of the ICHR’s noteworthy accomplishments was its creation of the Community Land Titles Act on 18 March 1964. This Act was intended to facilitate the process by which Nova Scotians could apply to clear their land titles. \u0026hellip;\nThe article by Lindsay Van Dyk that is published on the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 website contains similar historical information as the Colter thesis. The author describes the migration of people of African descent to Nova Scotia, starting in the late 1700s. In relation to land grants, she writes:\nUpon their arrival in Nova Scotia, the Black Refugees experienced many hardships. The government withheld land grants, an influx of white immigration increased competition for the few jobs available, and the rocky, infertile land proved difficult to cultivate. Under these conditions, extreme poverty became a reality for many Black Refugees. \u0026hellip;\nThe Black Refugees settled in the rural areas around Halifax, with the largest communities established at Preston, Hammonds Plains and Beechville. Initially, the settlers were “well pleased and satisfied” at the prospect of having land to call their own. However, the government did not give the Black Refugees outright grants to the land, but rather tickets of location or licenses of occupation. This denied the Black Refugees the opportunity to own land or sell it for a profit. The lots provided by the government were limited to ten acres and located on rocky, infertile soil. In these conditions, crops planted by the Black Refugees repeatedly failed. A series of devastating natural events made efforts to cultivate the land even more difficult. In 1815, entire fields were destroyed by hordes of mice that swept across Nova Scotia’s countryside. The following year became known as the “Year without a Summer,” as the ground stayed frozen until June and ten inches of snow fell that same month. Even when the Black Refugees did achieve some success in producing crops, the long, cold winter seasons generally depleted their resources. Many Black Refugees were forced to rely on government assistance and private charity despite their best efforts to become independent.\nThe white population of Nova Scotia resented the dependence of the Black Refugees and did not accept them as equal members of society. Provincial authorities protested that the Refugees were “unfitted by nature to this climate, or to an association with the rest of His Majesty’s Colonists.” The general poverty of the Black Refugees was regarded as proof that the black population was more suited to slavery than freedom. \u0026hellip;\n[Emphasis added]\nThe Report of the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent on its mission to Canada contains the following references to land titles in Nova Scotia:\nThe Working Group is concerned about the lack of implementation of the Land Titles Clarification Act in Nova Scotia, which should assist people of African descent in obtaining titles to the lands on which they live. The Act was passed in Nova Scotia in 1963 to create a process to assist with the clarification of land title and land ownership issues for residents living in 13 specific communities in Nova Scotia. For historic and systemic reasons, there was a lack of land ownership documentation for the residents of those areas and communities, many of whom are African Nova Scotian. The Act was intended to provide a simpler and inexpensive mechanism to obtain clarification of land titles. Under the Act, a certificate of title is issued to applicants who can show that they used and occupied the land claimed for at least 20 years. The process provides for notice to be given to the community and issues such as competing ownership claims and unsettled boundaries to be resolved before a certificate can be issued. Civil society informed the Working Group that the system in place under the Act was not working as hoped. The process is reportedly unjust and discriminatory, and many have had their claims rejected. Residents must bear the burden for submitting all the documentation, as well as the application, lawyer and surveyor fees necessary to have the land title clarified. In May 2015, the Department of Natural Resources, which is responsible for processing the applications, acknowledged that the process was unclear and stated they were attempting to pilot a project to assist residents in the community to obtain the title to their property. It was recognized that there were financial and logistical hurdles for some residents wishing to obtain a certificate of title, as residents were responsible for all the costs of the process, include [sic] surveying and legal fees. However, an interdepartmental committee was currently considering various options for removing or reducing those barriers and providing support to African Nova Scotians to help them clarify titles to their properties. The Working Group emphasized that the Act must be implemented in collaboration with, and for the benefit of, the affected population group. All resources should be made available, fees should be waived and remedies should be provided for any discriminatory policies relating to the process of granting a certificate of title.

What is the meaning of the word \u0026ldquo;property\u0026rdquo;? What is the scope of the phrase \u0026ldquo;take any property without compensation\u0026rdquo;? My Lords, I would declare my indebtedness not only to the counsel for the parties but also to the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland and those assisting him for the help that they have given the House in the consideration of these questions. With their aid, your Lordships have explored the federal constitutions of the United States of America, of Canada and of Australia in which are to be found words similar, but, perhaps, not very similar, to the words now under review. But, my Lords, I doubt whether at the end of that journey the path is brightly illuminated. I should like, however, before I venture on it, to consider for a moment the simple language of the Constitutional Act with which we are concerned. I hope that I do not over-simplify the problem, if I ask whether anyone using the English language in its ordinary signification would say of a local authority which imposed some restriction on the user of property by its owner that that authority had \u0026ldquo;taken \u0026quot; that owner\u0026rsquo;s \u0026quot; property\u0026rdquo;. He would not make any fine distinction between \u0026ldquo;take\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;take over \u0026quot; or \u0026ldquo;take away\u0026rdquo; He would agree that \u0026ldquo;property\u0026rdquo; is a word of very wide import, including intangible and tangible property. But he would surely deny that any one of those rights, which in the aggregate constitute ownership of property, could itself and by itself aptly be called \u0026ldquo;property\u0026rdquo; and, to come to the instant case, he would deny that the right to use property in a particular way was itself property and that the restriction or denial of that right by a local authority was a \u0026ldquo;taking\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;taking away \u0026quot; or \u0026ldquo;taking over \u0026quot; of \u0026ldquo;property.\u0026rdquo;\nI do not seek to qualify in any way what has been said in such cases as Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) v. Cannon Brewery Co., Ltd. I have no right to do so. It is no doubt the law that the intention to take away property without compensation is not to be imputed to the legislature unless it is expressed in unequivocal terms. But this principle, on which learned counsel for the respondents so vigorously insisted, seems to me to have no bearing on the question what is the meaning of the phrase \u0026ldquo;take property without compensation\u0026rdquo; in a constitutional instrument such as the Government of Ireland Act. If, indeed, I must have recourse to any broad principle of law for the construction of these few simple words, I should remind myself that from the earliest times the owner of property, and in particular of land, has been restricted in his free enjoyment of it not only by the common law maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas, but by positive enactments limiting his user or even imposing burdens on him. I do not, therefore, approach this question of construction with any predisposition to enlarge the scope of the vital words. For, my Lords, I would here point out that, if such restrictions as the Acts of 1931 and 1944 impose cannot be enforced without the payment of compensation, the practical effect must be to deprive the Parliament of Northern Ireland of the power to legislate not only in this particular field in a manner recognised as necessary to its proper fulfilment in Great Britain but in numerous other fields also in which it has been widely realised that the rights of the individual must be subordinate to the general interest. Learned counsel for the respondents were constrained to admit that their success in this argument might lead to the invalidation of numerous Acts whose validity has been hitherto unchallenged. It would not be easy to reconcile this result with the power accorded to the Parliament by s. 4 of the Act to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Northern Ireland. It is right, however, that, in the interpretation of constitutional instruments, guidance should be sought from those courts whose constant duty it has been to construe similar instruments, if only because, as it appears to me, a flexibility of construction is admissible in regard to such instruments which might be rejected in construing ordinary statutes or inter partes documents. The courts of Northern Ireland have not hesitated to adopt this course and have found assistance in their task of construing their own constitution from the manner in which great judges among the English-speaking peoples overseas have dealt with kindred problems. I do not think that any better examples can be found than in the passages cited by the Lord Chief Justice from the judgments of Holmes, J., and Brandeis, J. Thus, when Brandeis, J., says in the passage quoted by the Lord Chief Justice from his judgment in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon:\nEvery restriction upon the use of property imposed in the exercise of the police power deprives the owner of some right theretofore enjoyed, and is, in that sense, an abridgment by the state of rights in property without making compensation. But restriction imposed to protect the public health, safety or morals from dangers threatened is not a taking. The restriction here in question is merely the prohibition of a noxious use,\nthat very learned judge indicates in clear terms the distinction which should guide us in determining whether or not legislation which diminishes the owner\u0026rsquo;s free enjoyment of his own property is a \u0026ldquo;taking\u0026rdquo; of that property. It is clear that such a diminution of rights can be effected without a cry being raised that Magna Carta is dethroned or a sacred principle of liberty infringed. I will say only one thing more about the American cases. The day may come when it will be necessary to consider the relevance to the constitution of Northern Ireland of the observation of Holmes, J., in the case already cited:\nThe general rule at least is, that while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognised as a taking.\nIf the question is one of degree, I am clearly of opinion that the day did not arrive with s. 10 (2) of the Act of 1931.\nMy Lords, the distinction drawn between \u0026ldquo;regulating\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;taking\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;regulatory\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;confiscatory\u0026rdquo; will at once bring to mind the controversy to which placitum (xxxi) of s. 51 of the Australian Constitution has given rise. On decisions of the High Court of Australia on this placitum the respondents strongly relied. At one stage, learned counsel said he was prepared to rest his case on Minister of State for the Army v. Dalziel, the facts in which case were widely different from those we have now to consider. No doubt the language there under review \u0026ldquo;the acquisition of property on just terms \u0026quot; was not dissimilar to that in our constitutional Act, and these words have led to much the same controversy as have the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments in the United States of America. Nor do I doubt that the same considerations are relevant to the determination of their meaning. Nor would I cast the least doubt on the decision in Dalziel\u0026rsquo;s case or anything that was said by the learned judges who decided it. But, having said so much and fully recognising the distinction that may exist between measures that are regulatory and measures that are confiscatory, and that a measure which is ex facie regulatory may in substance be confiscatory, I must add that if, as I suppose it is, the question is one of degree and the dividing line is difficult to draw, yet I have no doubt that such an enactment as the Act of 1931 and, in particular, s. 10 (2) falls well on the regulatory side of it. The respondents get no help from Australia.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n"},{"id":74,"href":"/casebook/governance/black/","title":"Black v Canadian Copper Co.","section":"Chapter 2","content":" Middleton J. — # A large number of actions were brought, and many others threatened against the Canadian Copper Company, for damages supposed to have been sustained from vapours contained in metallurgical smoke issuing from the roast beds and smelter stacks of that company at Copper Cliff, near Sudbury. A motion was made to consolidate these actions resulting in the choice of four cases which were to proceed and to be regarded as test actions, the others remaining in abeyance in the meantime.\nThe actions chosen were:\nAn action by J. F Black a florist having a greenhouse and number of small plots upon which market garden produce was grown\nAn action by Jos. Belanger, a farmer, upon a somewhat larger scale than usual for this district, who had claims for damage done to two farms.\nAn action by Mona Taillifer, a woman who worked also upon two farms not at all comparable to Belanger\u0026rsquo;s farms, and in a much humbler way.\nAn action by the Sudbury Dairy Company, milk dealers, who have a farm upon which their dairy herd was pastured quite close to Copper Cliff.\nTwo actions were also pending against the Mond Nickel Company and It was arranged that those should be dealt with at the same time.\nAll evidence taken in the first four actions was to be available in any of them and so far as it might be of value in the actions against the Mond Company, but the parties to the actions against that Company were to give such further evidence as they might desire. Subsequently it was arranged that certain evidence taken in the Mond cases should be used in the Copper Company cases. The actions against the Mond Company are:\nAn action by Mr. Clary, a member of the bar, who practises at Sudbury and who owns a farm in the Township of Dill, some 12 miles away.\nAn action by a man named Ostroski and his wife who own a small farm near the town of Coniston, where the Mond smelter Is situated. Ostroski and his wife kept a boarding house for men employed at the Mond works and this farm was originally intended mainly to supply vegetables for use at their boarding house.\nIn all these actions claims were originally made for an injunction but at different times this claim has been abandoned and now the cases resolve themselves mainly, if not altogether, into assessments of damages. The difficulty is to ascertain what damage, if any, has been done by the omission of the smoke vapours from the roast beds and smelter stacks. While the admission of counsel makes my task easy so far as the granting of an injunction is concerned, I may say that in view of all that has occurred, I should not have granted an injunction interfering with the carrying on of the works in question.\nSmelter smoke may, no doubt, be a nuisance, and in addition to being disagreeable it may cause injury to vegetation and in some circumstances I have no doubt an injunction ought to be granted. For reasons which will appear later, I am of the opinion that the mines cannot be operated without the production of smoke from the roast yards and smelters which contains very large quantities of sulphur dioxide.\nIn each case it ultimately becomes a question of degree and in a much modified sense a question of the greatest good to the greatest number. I do not mean by this as I shall show that for the mere purpose of early producing metal of value the owner of a mine may sacrifice his neighbours, but I think there are circumstances in which it is impossible for the individual to so assert his individual rights as to inflict a substantial injury upon the whole community.\nThe individual right must be tenderly consigned but if pressed too far, if the Courts are found impotent, the Legislature must intervene and the right of eminent domain must be asserted for the weal of the community as a whole.\nThe nickel region at Sudbury is an area some 26 miles from south west to north east, 16 miles wide. The ore deposits are situated at the edge of this huge basin where the edges of a great eruptive sheet appear. The inside of the basin is filled with sedimentary rocks and it is surrounded by the ordinary archaean rocks of the district.\nThe whole district (I speak of this mining region, not of the vastly larger judicial district concerning which evidence has been given in a way that might mislead) has been burned over many times and while originally there were, no doubt white pines of considerable size these have long since disappeared and the only forest growth Is that usually found in northern Ontario small jack pines, birch and poplar. Repeated fires have denuded this \u0026ldquo;second growth\u0026rdquo; time and again and the entire soil has disappeared from most of the rocky hills either by being burned by fires in the dry season or by the operation of wind and rain. So the country now consists of the bare rocks, \u0026ldquo;mountains,\u0026rdquo; in local parlance, upon which a few trees of little value maintain a stunted existence and valleys between, some very narrow, which are level and more or less fertile. Many, if not most of these valleys are swamp or muskeg, and beaver meadow, few only are adapted for farming without drainage.\nIn some of these valleys the soil found is remarkably fertile in others it is sour and hard to cultivate; much depends upon the natural drainage.\nUntil minerals were found, this whole country remained a wilderness but when mines were opened up towns and villages sprang up around the mines and farms began to be cultivated to supply the needs of the community.\nIf the mines should be prevented from operating the community could not exist at all once close the mines the mining community would be at an end and farming would not long continue. Any capable farmer would find farms easier to operate and nearer general markets if the local market ceased.\nIt is the consideration of this situation that induced the plaintiffs\u0026rsquo; counsel to abandon the claim originally made for an injunction.\nAll this appealed to me, but there is also a further consideration that seemed to me even more important. Nickel is essential for many of the world\u0026rsquo;s greatest industries; the metal is only found in a few places; it cannot be mined and placed upon the market without producing a nuisance and affecting, at most, a comparatively small area; those going into that area to farm have ( in almost all cases) gone there with their eyes open, seeking to avail themselves of a market in which abnormally high prices rule because of the demands created by those mines and their great distance from ordinary sources of supply.\nSome cases of hardship may exist but according to the statement of counsel the mining companies have always stood ready to purchase the holdings of any individual at a price far in excess of the value.\nIn my view the Court ought not to destroy the mining industry even if a few farms are damaged or destroyed, but in all such cases compensation liberally ought to be awarded.\nThe Court has now by statute discretion to refuse an injunction and to award damages in lieu thereof. In Shelfer v. City of London (1895) 1 Ch. 287, working rules for the exercise of this discretion are laid down perhaps none apply to the case in hand but no such situation as that which exists here has been considered in any reported decision.\nAlthough the mines have been in operation for many years this is the first time in which actions have come to trial. The explanation given is that some arrangement for compensation has heretofore been made, but now claims have been made and adjustment seems impossible and the Courts have been resorted to and much evidence has been given with the view of having it ascertained how far the mines are answerable for the crop failures. The Company sets up that many of the things complained of are not the result of the smoke but are to be attributed to entirely other causes, and that the claims are grossly exaggerated.\nMuch time and money has been expended in preparing for the defence of these actions and I have had throughout to be on my guard lest the plaintiffs should be found waging an unequal warfare, but the plaintiffs represent a large constituency and their case has been well looked after. The admission by the defendants of certain evidence has saved the expense incident to expert evidence and has brought before the Court the result of proceedings in other jurisdictions where similar situations have been faced.\nIn addition to claims for damage to crops claims were made for permanent injury to the soil.\nAs will be seen when the individual cases are discussed the amounts claimed in these test cases are large, but the totals claimed in all the suits must be a very large sum.\nIn the fall of 1915, the Government took action and by an order in council reciting that lands in the vicinity of the roast beds of the Mond Company \u0026ldquo;cannot be considered fit for agriculture purposes\u0026rdquo; withdrew them from location or sale. Shortly thereafter another order in council was passed withdrawing all unpatented lands near the Canadian Copper Company\u0026rsquo;s works. About the same time the Canadian Copper Company, obtained a new location some 15 miles from Copper Cliff, for its roast beds and all roasting since June of 1916 has been done upon the new beds.\nIn 1916 the Mond Company adopted a new system by which all the heap roasting was done upon the beds in the winter season and only reduction of fine ore took place in their sintering machines during the season when crops were growing.\nThe Copper Company does not use the sintering machine and with its much larger output cannot arrange to do the roasting during the winter months only.\nBoth companies use blast furnaces for the further reduction of ore and production of matte and the Canadian Copper Company, also use reverberatory furnaces for the treatment of fine ore, these are not complained of.\n[…]\n"},{"id":75,"href":"/casebook/title/blackburn/","title":"Blackburn v McCallum","section":"Chapter 3","content":" Davies J. — # The question raised for our decision in this case is whether a general prohibition on alienation attached to a devise in fee of lands which prohibition would, if unlimited, be bad by the rules of Common Law, is made good by being limited as to time. I am of opinion that it is not. The will of Donald Chisholm after devising his farm of 100 acres to his two sons William and Hugh in fee and equally dividing it between them, contained the following provision:\nI will that the aforesaid parcels of land shall not be at their disposal at any time until the end of twenty-five years from the date of my decease, and farther, I will that the said parcels of land shall remain free from all incumbrance, and that no debts contracted by my sons, William Chisholm and Hugh Chisholm, shall by any means incumber the same during twenty-five years from the date of my decease.\nWith the exception of the limitation as to time the restraint upon alienation by the devisees is general. The question is one of real property law, and it is a pure question of authority. The general rule avoiding conditions which prohibited a grantee in fee from alienating his land is to be found clearly laid down in all the earlier books of authority, and is founded upon principles about which there can be no doubt and which are easily intelligible. But there can be equally little doubt that upon this general rule there have been grafted several exceptions. The cases of Gill v. Pearson, in which the judgment of the full Court of King’s Bench was delivered by Lord Ellenborough, and the later case of In re Macleay, decided by Jessell M.R., establish the existence of exceptions to the general rule which it is not necessary for us to call in question. These two cases determine that a restriction upon alienation prohibiting it to a particular class of individuals is good. All the leading text writers upon real property law cite these cases with approval and in my opinion it is too late in the day now for us to call them in question. The whole subject is reviewed exhaustively by Pearson J. in the case of In re Rosher. The same question that is now before us was there before him and he held that the proviso in the will he was construing amounted to an absolute restraint upon alienation during the life of the testator’s widow and that it was void in law. The learned judge, while admitting that authority could be found in the notes to Shepherd’s Touchstone, 7th ed., p. 130, for the proposition that a “grantee might also be restrained from alienation for a particular time being a reasonable one,” went on to declare, p. 821:\nBut there has been no judicial decision to that effect; and it is a curious thing that although Littleton’s book is more than 400 years old and although Lord Coke died 250 years ago there is not a single judicial decision to be found in the books shewing that a limitation as to time added to such a condition makes it a valid condition.\nHe further stated that even without judicial decision, if he found that this had been an “accepted dictum of law,” and that by not following it he should be disturbing anything done in former times over and over again on the faith of the dictum, he should feel himself bound by it, and that it would be exceedingly mischievous to attempt to alter any rule which had been adopted and acquiesced in for more than a century. But he does not find that any such rule existed with respect to the validity of a general restraint upon alienation being validated by a limitation of the time within which it is to be exercised, and he concludes as follows:\nI find that the original rule which says that you cannot annex to a gift in fee simple a condition which is repugnant to that gift is a plain and intelligible rule. So far as I can find that an exception to the rule has been laid down and judiciously decided, I am bound by that exception. But I will not add other exceptions for which I can find no authority and the addition of which to my mind will only introduce uncertainty and confusion into the law which we have to administer.\nIf an exception to a general rule of law is well established by the cases I am not bound to inquire into the logical sufficiency of the reasons given. And so I do not feel it necessary to discuss the cases of Gill v. Pearson, or In re Macleay, or to justify the reasons which underlaid these decisions. In allowing this appeal we are, it is true, following the decision of Re Rosher, but we are not over-ruling either of the other cases above referred to in which limited restraints upon alienation were allowed. The decision we have reached while not being contrary to any judicial decision in England follows that of Pearson J. in Re Rosher, and is in line with the late cases of Re Parry v. Daggs; Corbett v. Corbett; and also with Renaud v. Tourangeau; and the Irish case of Martin v. Martin.\nWe have of course been pressed by the case of Earls v. McAlpine decided by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in 1881. The restriction upon alienation in that case was no doubt one limited as to time and on the point we have now before us. But the case of Re Rosher had not then been decided, and the authorities cited by Mr. Justice Patterson, namely, Daniel v. Abby; Doe v. Pearson; and In Re Macleay; while they support the contention that a restriction upon alienation limited to a specified class only may be good, do not support the proposition we are asked to indorse that a general restriction upon alienation which, if unrestricted as to time would be admittedly bad, is made good by a time limitation. It seems to me that a time limitation is necessary in any case where restrictions upon alienations are attempted to be imposed upon a fee simple devise, even with respect to a class of persons; otherwise the devise might be bad as contravening the rule against perpetuities. But I cannot concur in the proposal that we should enlarge the exceptions to the general rule against restrictions upon alienations by the addition of one not at any rate judicially adopted in England and which would give validity to a restriction otherwise bad simply by limiting the time during which it should last. I cannot find any rule for determining how long this time might be beyond that suggested by Mr. Preston in his note to Shepherd’s Touchstone, p. 130, that “it must not trench on the law against perpetuities.” But while that suggestion with respect to a time limitation may be good and necessary when applied to restrictions limited to a class of persons, and which might otherwise be bad for remoteness, I cannot, either on reason or authority, find that its application to a general restriction bad in itself operates to make that restriction good.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and it should be declared that Hugh Chisholm took a fee simple absolute by his father’s will in the lands devised to him and was able to convey the same in fee notwithstanding the restriction in the will. And also that the fee simple in the lands was subject to sale under execution as against Hugh Chisholm for his debts.\nMills J. — # […]\nThe restraints upon alienation, which were the logical outcome of the feudal system, were gradually relaxed. There was the law of Henry I which enabled a man to dispose of the land which he himself had purchased, for over them the law recognised in him a more extensive power than over those which had come to him by descent from his ancestors He was not, however, to dispose of the whole of what he had acquired, if by doing so he disinherited his children. He might sell one-fourth of what he had inherited, with the consent of the heir. These restrictions were removed by the statute of Quia Emptores, which conferred upon all tenants, whether tenants in chivalry or in sergeanty, the liberty to alien their lands except in the case of the King’s tenants in capite, subject to the condition that the purchaser of the fee should hold of the chief lord, and not of the grantor. Pearson J., in referring to the restraint upon alienation mentioned by Littleton, says:\nI confess that I am absolutely at a loss to understand how that exception arose, because it is plainly just as much repugnant to the gift as any other condition would be, for the implied power given to alien to any person or persons he pleases includes a liberty to alien to J.S. if he chooses to do so.\nI think when we trace the history of real property law, that it is not difficult to understand how the limited restraint mentioned by Littleton came into existence. It must not be forgotten that under the feudal system the right of alienation was restrained. That system established certain relations between the lord and his tenant. It was based upon an implied contract upon which the structure of society, as it then existed, rested, and it could not be departed from without the common consent of those concerned. The relaxations in the system are indicative of the changes which society itself was undergoing, and these relaxations did not proceed equally in the direction of all parties concerned. The law, as we would be inclined to make it so as to give to it logical consistency, did not at any time exist.\nIt is the scientific and systematised view that we get from looking back historically over the field after a good deal of progress has been made. It is reasonable to say that where an estate is bestowed, of which the power of alienation is an incident, that one conveying such an estate to another shall not have the power to alter its character, and to make it something wholly different from what it has been made by the law. To do so is to assume the power to make an estate unknown to the law. It is an attempt not simply to convey away an estate, but to exercise a legislative power, and to create a new form of property in land.\n[…]\nIn my opinion this appeal should be allowed, and it should be declared that Hugh Chisholm took an estate in fee simple, relieved from the restrictions imposed by his father’s will upon the sale of the estate, and against incumbering it with any debts which he may contract.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\n"},{"id":76,"href":"/problems/blue-mountain/","title":"Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Lakes","section":"Problems","content":" Irwin Barrett - Ecology Action Centre\nBlue Mountain-Birch Cove Lakes is a stunning wilderness area located minutes from downtown Halifax. Attempts by the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) to prevent development on private lands next to the wilderness area have made landowners unhappy.\nBlue Mountain-Birch Cove was designated as a provincially-protected wilderness area in 2009. It started as 1,316 hectares of Crown land and was later expanded, in 2015, to 1,767 hectares. Several private landowners own undeveloped lands adjacent to the protected area. One of those landowners is the Annapolis Group Inc. (Annapolis), whose undeveloped lands have remained essentially wilderness since Annapolis began to acquire them sometime in the middle of the last century.\nMap of Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Protected Area, Wikimedia Commons\nIn 2006, the HRM Council passed a Regional Municipal Planning Strategy (MPS) to guide future land development in the regional municipality for the next 25 years. In effect, the MPS lays out a vision for future land development across the region based on broad public consultation but does not commit the municipality to undertake any specific actions pursuant to the plan.\nThe 2006 Regional MPS designated a portion of Annapolis\u0026rsquo; lands for possible future serviced development (such as a low-density residential subdivision) and a portion for a possible future regional park.\nAt the same time as the HRM Council passed the Regional MPS, it also passed the Halifax Mainland Land Use By-Law, which establishes and assigns the necessary land-use zones needed to implement the MPS designations. Under the zoning by-law, no development can occur on the Annapolis lands unless the HRM Council passes a resolution authorizing a secondary planning process and subsequent zoning amendment.\nIn 2007, Annapolis requested that HRM Council initiate such a secondary planning process. But after widespread public backlash against Annapolis\u0026rsquo; development plans (which included a proposal to shrink the proposed park to accommodate a larger subdivision development), Council instead passed a resolution in 2016 refusing to proceed with further planning and zoning changes to the Annapolis lands. As a result, the current zoning by-law continues to prohibit any development on those lands.\nIn 2017, Annapolis filed a Notice of Action and Statement of Claim alleging that HRM had de facto expropriated its lands for public use as a park. As part of this claim, Annapolis alleges that HRM encouraged members of the public to hike, cycle, canoe, camp and swim on its lands (along with the protected lands within the Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Wilderness Area) and financially supported organizations making similar encouragements.\nAnnapolis claims compensation for the de facto expropriation under Nova Scotia\u0026rsquo;s Expropriation Act, which provides that every person whose land is expropriated by a public authority shall be paid reasonable compensation. The Expropriation Act defines \u0026ldquo;expropriation\u0026rdquo; as a \u0026ldquo;taking of land\u0026rdquo; but does not further define what amounts to such a taking.\nBased on the facts above, is the Court likely to find that HRM has de facto expropriated Annapolis\u0026rsquo; land, thereby ordering the municipality to pay compensation? We will try to come up with an initial answer to this question based on the materials studied this week.\n"},{"id":77,"href":"/casebook/governance/bna-s9213/","title":"British North America Act, s 92","section":"Chapter 2","content":" Exclusive Powers of Provincial Leglislatures # In each Province the Legislature may exclusively make Laws in relation to Matters coming within the Classes of Subjects next hereinafter enumerated, that is to say, [\u0026hellip;]\nProperty and Civil Rights in the Province.

The discomforts arising from the mass of impurities that city smoke produces must also, often being long established conditions of such life, be endured.\nThe legislative provisions made in France far in advance of anything we have in Canada dealing directly or indirectly with such a problem as presented herein and the opinion of commentators in light thereof and largely founded upon such light, cannot help us.\nNor, I submit, can the very minor modifications thereof, relegating to the municipal authorities the power to prohibit, be held as at all effective.\nI cannot see why the power of a municipality to act, but which yet fails to act, can at all interfere with the rights of an owner to enjoy his property in the full sense thereof.\nThe municipality is not given and, I respectfully submit, should not be given power to take away unless upon due compensation the rights of the owner to enjoy his property which carries with it pure air, light and pure water.\nThe argument, that because the exercise by appellant of powers it arrogates to itself but are non-existent in law, may conduce to the prosperity of the little town or village in which the appellants’ works are situated, seems to have led to a mass of irrelevant evidence being adduced, and as a result thereof the confusion of thought that produces the remarkable conclusion that because the prosperity of said town or village would be enhanced by the use of the new process therefore the respondent has no rights upon which to rest his rights of property.\nI cannot assent to any such mode of reasoning or that there exists in law any such basis for taking from any man his property and all or any part of what is implied therein.\nYet upon some such possible basis the mass of evidence before us seems to have been presented.\nThe invasion of rights incidental to the ownership of property, or the confiscation thereof, may suit the grasping tendencies of some and incidentally the needs or desires of the majority in any community benefiting thereby; yet such a basis or principle of action should be stoutly resisted by our courts, in answer to any such like demands or assertions of social right unless and until due compensation made by due process of law.\nProgress may be legislatively made in that direction by many means offering due compensation to the owners, but we must abide by the fundamental law as we find it until changed.\nAnd I cannot find that in France or Quebec any such legal theory as that argument rests upon has any foundation.\nIn looking up authorities upon the question of injunction, such as this, I find in Kerr’s Law of Injunctions, 4th edition, at middle of page 155 and following, what I think expresses the right of the owner to an injunction such as in question.\nThe history of that mode of remedy might require a volume, which I have no intention of writing, but to the curious I would commend the perusal of Story on Equity Jurisprudence, section 865 and following sections, as instructive of how in all probability the history of Quebec law, as also English equity jurisprudence, had its origin in regard to the assertion of a remedy by way of injunction.\nIt is a most beneficial remedy and should not be weakened or emaciated merely because of preference of its development in one jurisdiction over that of another.\nI was, indeed, in considering this case and trying to find the relevant law, somewhat struck with a remark of V.C. Sir W. Page Wood, in the beginning of his judgment in the case of Dent v. Auction Mart Co. and other cases, that though the doctrine invoked had been established by Lord Eldon in Attorney General v. Nichol, and never had been departed from, that it was remarkable how few instances had occurred until ten or twelve years before 1866, when he was speaking, and within that short period how the number had increased.\nThe wave, if I may so speak of progress, in way of applying any legal doctrine thus varies very much, but I must be permitted to think that the courts should be tenacious in the way of abiding by such a beneficent remedy as that by way of injunction.\nThe case of The Directors of St. Helen’s Smelting Co. v. Tipping, in the House of Lords, is one of the landmarks, as it were in the modern English law on the subject, and the case of Crossley \u0026amp; Sons, Ltd. v. Lightowler, and cases cited therein, and the more recent case of Shelfer v. City of London Electric Lighting Co. may be found instructive as to the later development.\nI have not heard or read in factums presented here anything cited in conflict with the principles therein proceeded upon.\nMany early cases, and even late cases, can be found if one fails to take the principle of law involved as his guide rather than many decisions going off on special grounds which seem to conflict with said leading authorities.\nThe subject is a very wide one and in many phases of its historical development do we find much that may not be worth considering because of the peculiar facts involved.\nAnd, I respectfully submit, that as long as we keep in view the essential merits of the remedy in the way of protecting the rights of property and preventing them from being invaded by mere autocratic assertions of what will be more conducive to the prosperity of the local community by disregarding such rights, we will not go far astray in taking as our guide the reasoning of any jurisprudence which recognizes the identical aim of protecting people in their rights of property when employing their remedy of perpetual injunction.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nNevertheless whilst strongly holding that, in cases such as this, the remedy by way of damages being inefficient and hence a basis for a perpetual injunction, yet, inasmuch as there may ere long be discovered by science or mechanical device, or both combined, a means of using sulphates in the process of manufacturing such as in question herein, there should have perhaps been expressed in the formal judgment a reservation entitling the appellant to apply to the court below for relief in such event, if meantime it has observed the injunction.\nLet us hope that such an inducement may lead to resorting to science in a way that is not obvious in the evidence to which we were referred in argument.\nDuff J. — # The respondent has established that the enjoyment of his property as a dwelling house is prejudicially affected in a substantial degree and in a degree which entitles him to invoke the protection of the court against the injurious consequences of the manufacturing operations of the appellant company who are clearly chargeable as for a quasi-delit within Art. 1053 of the Civil Code.\nThe substantial question for consideration is whether or not the respondent is entitled to the injunction which has been awarded him. There appear to be good reasons for thinking that the discontinuance of the appellant company’s operations would result in material loss and inconvenience to their employees and their families who would probably be obliged to leave the locality in which they live at present in order to find means of livelihood elsewhere. But I am not satisfied that this will be the necessary result of the relief granted to the respondent. Indeed my conclusion, after a perusal of the whole evidence, is that the cessation of the appellant company’s operations would be neither the necessary nor the probable result of that relief.\nI am far from accepting the contention put forward on behalf of the respondent that considerations touching the effect of granting the injunction upon the residents of the neighbourhood and indeed upon the interests of the appellant company itself are not considerations properly to be taken into account in deciding the question whether or not the remedy by injunction should be accorded the plaintiff under the law of Quebec. The court in granting that remedy exercises a judicial discretion not, that is to say, an arbitrary choice or a choice based upon the personal views of the judge, but a discretion regulated in accordance with judicial principles as illustrated by the practice of the courts in giving and withholding the remedy. An injunction will not be granted where, having regard to all the circumstances, to grant it would be unjust; and the disparity between the advantage to the plaintiff to be gained by the granting of that remedy and the inconvenience and disadvantage which the defendant and others would suffer in consequence thereof may be a sufficient ground for refusing it. Where the injury to the plaintiff’s legal rights is small and is capable of being estimated in money, and can be adequately compensated by a money payment, and where on the other hand the restraining or mandatory order of the court, if made, would bear oppressively upon the defendant and upon innocent persons, then although the plaintiff has suffered and is suffering an injury in his legal rights the court may find and properly find in these circumstances a reason for declining to interfere by exercising its powers in personam. This is not, as was suggested in argument, equivalent to subjecting the plaintiff to a process of expropriation, it is merely applying the limitations and restrictions which the law imposes in relation to the pursuit of this particular form of remedy in order to prevent it becoming an instrument of injustice and oppression.\nThese last mentioned considerations, however, are not those which govern the disposition of the present appeal; the respondent’s injury is substantial, is continuing, and there is no satisfactory ground for thinking that any kind of disproportionate injury to the appellant company or to others will ensue from putting into execution the remedy granted by the court below.\nAnglin J. — # My impression at the close of the argument was that the findings of the learned trial judge, — affirmed in appeal, — that the odours and gases emitted from the defendant’s sulphate plant were so extremely offensive to the senses that they “caused sensible discomfort and annoyance” to the plaintiff and his family, diminished the comfort and value of the plaintiff’s property and “materially interfered with the ordinary comfort of existence in the plaintiff’s said home”; and that\nthe plaintiff cannot be adequately compensated in damages for the deprivation of the useful enjoyment of his property by the nuisance created and maintained by the said defendant —\nwere well warranted. Subsequent consideration of the evidence has only served to convert that impression into a firm conviction. To these findings, moreover, I would add another. The evidence has also satisfied me that sulphate soda pulp can readily be purchased by the defendants, or, if they should prefer to take that course, can be made by them at some other place, — for instance at or near to their pulpwood limits — where its production will be innocuous. The manufacture of sulphate pulp at Windsor Mills is not at all essential to the defendants’ continuing to produce there the classes and grades of paper for the making of which they now use such pulp prepared by a process in which sulphate of soda, salt or nitrate cake is an important ingredient.\nAs Mr. Justice Flynn points out, it is common ground that science has been unable to indicate any means whereby the emanation and diffusion of these highly objectionable gases and odours in the manufacture of sulphate pulp can be obviated.\nThe proposition that the existence of the state of affairs so found by the trial judge implies an invasion by the defendants of the plaintiff’s right of enjoyment of his property, likely to be persistent, far in excess of anything justifiable under les droits de voisinage, and amounting to an actionable wrong entitling him to relief in a court of law and justice scarcely calls for the citation of authority. But, if authority be required, it may be found in abundance in the able judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Flynn and in the factum and memorandum of authorities filed by the respondent.\nThe power to grant an injunction is broad. Arts. 957, 968, C.P.C. I cannot think that, under such circumstances as the evidence here discloses, the court is restricted to giving such inadequate and unsatisfactory relief as the awarding of damages. Baudry-Lacantinerie, Des Biens, Nos. 215-225, notably 224; 2 Aubry et Rau (5 ed.) p. 305. See too Wood v. Conway; Adams v. Ursell. Subject, therefore, to consideration of the several objections to that course taken in the dissenting opinions of the Chief Justice of Quebec and Mr. Justice Guerin, I should be disposed to agree with the learned judges who composed the majority of the Court of King’s Bench (Flynn, Tellier and Howard JJ.) that the injunction granted in the Superior Court should be upheld.\nThree difficulties are suggested by the learned Chief Justice: (1) The nuisance created is public and the right to suppress it belongs to the municipal authority under the R.S.Q. Arts. 5639 (14) and 5683 and not to the courts at the instance of a private property owner affected thereby: (2) It is in the interest of the great majority of the inhabitants of Windsor Mills that the operations of the defendant should not be interfered with; balance of convenience therefore requires that the injunction should be dissolved: (3) The injunction sought is not susceptible of enforcement without personal constraint of the defendants’ officials.\nMr. Justice Guerin’s view is that the injunction is too radical and too heroic a remedy under the circumstances, viz. the impossibility of operating the sulphate process without emitting the odors and gases complained of, and the non-interference of the municipal authorities — and that damages would be the appropriate legal remedy.\nThe nuisance caused by the defendants no doubt affects the entire neighbouring population and other persons who have occasion to come within the sphere of its annoyance. But the injury to the plaintiff’s property is different in kind from the inconvenience suffered by the inhabitants at large — most of whom, moreover, are so dependent upon the operation of the defendants’ mills for their support that they are quite prepared to submit to some personal annoyance rather than jeopardize their means of livelihood. The inaction of the municipal authorities is no doubt ascribable to similar influences. By the nuisance of which he complains the plaintiff’s property is practically rendered uninhabitable and useless for the purposes for which he holds it. In my opinion he suffers an injury sufficiently distinct in character from that common to the inhabitants at large to warrant his maintaining this action. Adami v. City of Montreal; Barthélémy c. Sénès; Derosne c. Puzin et al; Polsue \u0026amp; Alfieri, Ltd. v. Rushmer; Francklyn v. Peoples Heat \u0026amp; Light Co.; Joyce on Nuisances s. 14. The fact that the making of soda-sulphate pulp at Windsor Mills is not essential to the manufacture of the products which the defendant’s mills turn out is an answer to the objection based on balance of convenience — if indeed mere balance of convenience would be a sufficient ground under the civil law of Quebec for refusing to enjoin the use of a process which necessarily entails an unjustifiable invasion of the plaintiff’s legal right to the enjoyment of his property. Art. 1065 C.C.; Fuz. Herman, Code Annoté, Art. 544, Nos. 3 \u0026amp; 39; ibid. Arts. 1382-3, Nos. 105, 109, 244 bis; 16 Laurent, No. 199; 24 Demolombe, Nos. 503-5; Décarie et vir v. Lyall \u0026amp; Sons.\nI am of the opinion that the power of the Quebec Courts to punish for contempt (Art. 971 C.P.C.) affords a means of enforcing their orders which sufficiently answers the suggestion that the injunction granted cannot be executed and is therefore obnoxious to Art. 541 C.P.C. In France while the court will enjoin the defendant from doing that which he is under obligation not to do, it has not the means of enforcement of the order available under English law and in Quebec by process of punishment for contempt (Art. 971 C.P.C.; See Art. 1033m. added to old Code of Procedure by 41 V. c. 14 s. 12; Art. 5991, R.S.Q. 1888). In France, the court can award damages in advance for refusal to obey, either in a lump sum or toties quoties, but not as a means of constraint or of indirect compulsion. D. 82, 2, 81; S. 1897. 2. 9, 12; 3 Garsonnet, Procédure, No. 528; 24 Demolombe No. 491; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Des Biens No. 224, n. 3. France has no provision similar to Art. 971 C.C.P. and the Art. 1142 C.N. is more restrictive than the initial clause of Art. 1065 C.C. Whatever they may have been theretofore, since the changes made in 1878, by 41 V. c. 14, the jurisdiction and practice of the Quebec courts in regard to the remedy of injunction would seem to resemble the jurisdiction and practice of English courts rather than of the courts of France. Wills v. Central Ry. Co. I cannot assent to the third holding in Lombard v. Varennes as indicated in the head note. The arm of injunction would fail in one of its most useful applications if it should, on this ground, be held not to be available in a case such as that at bar. I am, with respect, satisfied that this objection rests on a mistaken conception of Art. 541 C.P.C.\nNor is it possible to maintain that damages will afford an adequate remedy to the plaintiff. If he were confined to this method of redress he would, in effect, be forced to submit to partial expropriation of his property, as Mr. Justice Tellier suggests, without statutory authority for such an exercise of eminent domain.\nNo delay was established such as might debar the plaintiff from a right to relief. Francklyn v. People’s Heat \u0026amp; Light Co.\nIn my opinion the difficulties suggested to granting the plaintiff’s prayer for an injunction are more imaginary than real. I should be sorry indeed to think that this branch of the jurisdiction of the courts of Quebec is as restricted as counsel for the defendants contends.\nTo confine the operation of the injunction to the periods of the year during which the plaintiff, his family or friends occupy the residence at Windsor Mills seems to be scarcely practicable. But there is no reason why liberty should not be reserved to the defendants to apply to be relieved from the inhibition if they can satisfy the Court that owing to scientific discovery sulphate pulp can and will be manufactured by them without interference with the plaintiff’s right to the enjoyment of his property.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nThe judgment of Brodeur J. is omitted.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n"},{"id":80,"href":"/casebook/title/canada-trust/","title":"Canada Trust Co v Ontario (Human Rights Commission)","section":"Chapter 3","content":" Robins J.A. — # The principal question in this appeal is whether the terms of a scholarship trust established in 1923 by the late Reuben Wells Leonard are now contrary to public policy.\n[…]\nThe Facts # A.

For the above reason the Settlor excludes from the management of, or benefits in the Foundation intended to be created by this Indenture, all who are not Christians of the White Race, all who are not of British Nationality or of British Parentage, and all who owe allegiance to any Foreign Government, Prince, Pope, or Potentate, or who recognize any such authority, temporal or spiritual.\nThe schools, colleges and universities in which the scholarships may be granted are described in the body of the Indenture in these terms:\nThe Schools, Colleges and Universities in which such Scholarships may be granted and enjoyed, are such one or more of Schools and Colleges in Canada and such one or more of Universities in Canada and Great Britain as the General Committee hereinafter described may from time to time in its absolute discretion select, but subject always to the requirements, terms and conditions concerning same as hereinbefore and hereinafter referred to and set out, and to the further conditions that any School, College or University so selected shall be free from the domination or control of adherents of the class or classes of persons hereinbefore referred to, whom the settlor intends shall be excluded from the management of or benefits in the said Foundation:\n[…]\nPROVIDED further and as an addition to the class or type of schools above designated or in the Schedule ‘A’ hereto attached, the term ‘School’ may for the purposes of Scholarships hereunder, include Public Schools and Public Collegiate Institutes and High Schools in Canada of the class or type commonly known as such in the Province of Ontario as distinguished from Public Schools and Collegiate Institutes and High Schools (if any) under the control and domination of the class or classes of persons hereinbefore referred to as intended to be excluded from the management of or benefits in said Foundation, and shall also include a Protestant Separate School, Protestant Collegiate Institute or Protestant High School in the Province of Quebec.\nPROVIDED further that in the selection of Schools, Colleges and Universities, as herein mentioned, preference must always be given by the Committee to the School, College or University, which, being otherwise in the opinion of the Committee eligible, prescribes physical training for female students and physical and military or naval training for male students.\n[Emphasis added.]\nThe management and administration of the Foundation is vested in a permanent committee known as the General Committee. The Committee consists of 25 members, all of whom must be possessed of the qualifications set out in the Indenture’s recitals:\nThe administration and management of the said Foundation is hereby vested in a permanent Committee to be known as the General Committee, consisting of twenty-five members, men and women possessed of the qualifications hereinbefore in recital set out.\n[Emphasis added.]\nThe General Committee is given, inter alia, the following power:\n(c) Power to select students or pupils of the classes or types hereinbefore and hereinafter described as recipients of the said Scholarship or for the enjoyment of same, as the Committee in its discretion may decide.\n[Emphasis added.]\nThe class of students eligible to receive scholarships is described as follows:\nSUBJECT to the provisions and qualifications hereinbefore and hereinafter contained, a student or pupil to be eligible for a Scholarship shall be a British Subject of the White Race and of the Christian Religion in its Protestant form, as hereinbefore in recital more particularly defined, who, without financial assistance, would be unable to pursue a course of study in any of the Schools, Colleges or Universities hereinbefore mentioned. Preference in the selection of students or pupils for Scholarships shall be given to the sons and daughters respectively of the following classes or descriptions of persons who are not of the classes or types of persons whom the Settlor intends to exclude from the management or benefit of the said Foundation as in the preamble or recital more particularly referred to, but regardless of the order of priority in which they are designated herein, namely:\n(a) Clergymen,\n(b) School Teachers,\n(c) Officers, non-commissioned Officers and Men, whether active or retired, who have served in His Majesty’s Military, Air or Naval Forces,\n(d) Graduates of the Royal Military College of Canada,\n(e) Members of the Engineering Institute of Canada,\n(f) Members of the Mining \u0026amp; Metalurgical [sic] Institute of Canada.\nPROVIDED further that in the selection, if any, of female students or pupils in any year under the provisions of this Indenture, the amount of income to be expended on such female students or pupils from and out of the moneys available for Scholarships under the terms hereof, shall not exceed one-fourth of the total moneys available for Scholarships for male and female students and pupils for such year.\n[Emphasis added.]\nThe settlor expressed the wish that:\n[T]he students or pupils who have enjoyed the benefits of a scholarship \u0026hellip; will form a Club or association for the purpose of\n… (b) Encouraging each other when the occasion arises and circumstances will permit, to personally afford financial assistance to pupils and students of similar classes as in recital hereinbefore described to obtain the blessings and benefits of education.\n[Emphasis added.]\nThe trustee is empowered at the expense of the trust to apply to a Judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario, possessing the qualifications set out in the recitals, for the opinion, advice and direction of the Court: “9. The Trustee is hereby empowered at the expense of the trust estate to apply to a Judge of the Supreme Court of Ontario possessing the qualifications required of a member of the General Committee as hereinbefore in recital set out, for the opinion, advice and direction of the Court in connection with the construction of this trust deed and in connection with all questions arising in the administration of the trusts herein declared.” [Emphasis added.] I should perhaps note that no challenge was put forth on this basis in either this Court or the Court below.\nThe Leonard Scholarships have been available for more than 65 years to eligible students across Canada and elsewhere, and are tenable at eligible schools, colleges and universities in Canada and Great Britain. Application forms are available upon request from members of the General Committee. An applicant submits the application through a member of the General Committee, who conducts a personal interview of the applicant, completes the nomination and recommendation and forwards the application to the General Committee.\nThe Committee on Scholarships meets in April or May of each year to consider all of the applications and to make recommendations to the General Committee. Finally, the General Committee meets and, after consideration of the recommendations of the Committee on Scholarships, approves the awards for the following academic year.\nB. The Circumstances Leading Up to the Application # The circumstances leading up to this application are described in the affidavit of Jack Cummings McLeod, a trust officer with Canada Trust Company who has been the secretary of the General Committee since 1975. In light of the public policy aspects of the application, the circumstances described by Mr. McLeod become significant.\nMr. McLeod deposes that, since 1975, he, as secretary, and various members of the General Committee have received correspondence from students, parents and academics expressing concerns and complaints with regard to the terms of eligibility for scholarships under the trust. Since 1956, numerous press articles, news reports and letters to the editor have appeared in the daily and university press of Canada commenting on or reporting on comments about the eligibility conditions. Mr. McLeod is aware of approximately 30 such articles, all generally critical of the eligibility requirements. The tenor of these articles is evident from their headings, which include “A Sorry Anachronism”, “Act Now on Racist Funding” and “Whites Only Scholarship is Labelled ‘Repugnant’.”\nSince 1971, the Human Rights Commissions of Alberta and Ontario and the Human Rights Branch of the Department of Labour of British Columbia have complained to the trustee and officials of the General Committee about the conditions of eligibility. Other bodies, such as the Saskatoon Legal Assistance Clinic and units of the Anglican Church of Canada, have made similar complaints.\nOver the years 1975 to 1982, various schools and universities, including the University of Toronto, the University of Western Ontario and the University of British Columbia, have also complained, without success, to the Foundation about the eligibility requirements. In 1982, the University of Toronto discontinued publication of the Leonard Scholarships and refused to continue processing award payments because of the University’s policy with respect to awards containing discriminatory or irrelevant criteria. The University of Alberta has taken similar action.\nIn January 1986, the chairman of the Ontario Human Rights Commission advised the Foundation that the terms of the scholarships appear to “run contrary to the public policy of the Province of Ontario” and requested “appropriate action to have the terms of the trust changed.” In response, the Foundation took the position that it was administering a private trust whose provisions did not offend the Human Rights Code, 1981.\nAt various times over the past 25 years, members of the General Committee and officials of the trustee have themselves expressed concern about the eligibility criteria. The matter has been considered internally and, it appears, has been the subject of “divisive” debate at meetings of the General Committee.\nIn April 1986, the Most Reverend Edward W. Scott, then Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada, the church of which the late Colonel Leonard was a prominent member, wrote to the Foundation expressing his “deep concerns” about the trust. He recorded, in strong terms, his view that the eligibility criteria are discriminatory and against public policy and not “in keeping with the spirit and intent of the Canadian Charter of Rights.” He urged the Committee to apply to the courts to have the offensive terms “read out of the trust deed \u0026hellip; with the ultimate result that effect will continue to be given to the trust deed and gift as a whole.” He concluded his letter stating:\nI have every confidence that if the kind benefactor of this Trust were living in 1986, rather than those many years ago, there would be agreement that the scope of possible recipients be widened bringing the document in line with standards of public acceptance of today. There is every reason why the good works of the generous benefactor of the Foundation should live on in perpetuity but, in my view, they must be in keeping with the society of today just as what was written those many years ago was, no doubt, although regretfully, in keeping with the society of that day.\nIn August 1986, the Ontario Human Rights Commission, not satisfied with the response to its earlier letter, filed a formal complaint against the Leonard Foundation, alleging that the trust contravened the Human Rights Code, 1981. […]\nThe Public Policy Issue # B. Does the Trust Violate Public Policy? # Viewing this trust document as a whole, does it violate public policy? In answering that question, I am not unmindful of the adage that “public policy is an unruly horse” or of the admonition that public policy “ ‘should be invoked only in clear cases, in which harm to the public is substantially incontestable, and does not depend on the idiosyncratic inferences of a few judicial minds’ “: Re Millar, [1938] S.C.R. 1, [1938] 1 D.L.R. 65, at 7 [S.C.R.]. I have regard also to the observation of Professor Waters in his text on the Law of Trusts in Canada, 2d ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1984), at 240 to the effect that:\nThe courts have always recognized that to declare a disposition of property void on the ground that the object is intended to contravene, or has the effect of contravening public policy, is to take a serious step. There is the danger that the judge will tend to impose his own values rather than those values which are commonly agreed upon in society and, while the evolution of the common law is bound to reflect contemporary ideas on the interests of society, the courts also feel that it is largely the duty of the legislative body to enact law in such matters, proceeding as such a body does by the process of debate and vote.\nNonetheless, there are cases where the interests of society require the court’s intervention on the grounds of public policy. This, in my opinion, is manifestly such a case.\nThe freedom of an owner of property to dispose of his or her property as he or she chooses is an important social interest that has long been recognized in our society and is firmly rooted in our law: Blathwayt v. Lord Cawley, [1976] A.C. 397, [1975] 3 All E.R. 625 (H.L.). That interest must, however, be limited in the case of this trust by public-policy considerations. In my opinion, the trust is couched in terms so at odds with today’s social values as to make its continued operation in its present form inimical to the public interest.\nAccording to the document establishing the Leonard Foundation, the Foundation must be taken to stand for two propositions: first, that the white race is best qualified by nature to be entrusted with the preservation, development and progress of civilization along the best lines, and second, that the attainment of the peace of the world and the advancement of civilization are best promoted by the education of students of the white race, of British nationality and of the Christian religion in its Protestant form.\nTo say that a trust premised on these notions of racism and religious superiority contravenes contemporary public policy is to expatiate the obvious. The concept that any one race or any one religion is intrinsically better than any other is patently at variance with the democratic principles governing our pluralistic society, in which equality rights are constitutionally guaranteed and in which the multicultural heritage of Canadians is to be preserved and enhanced. The widespread criticism of the Foundation by human rights bodies, the press, the clergy, the university community and the general community serves to demonstrate how far out of keeping the trust now is with prevailing ideas and standards of racial and religious tolerance and equality and, indeed, how offensive its terms are to fair-minded citizens.\nTo perpetuate a trust that imposes restrictive criteria on the basis of the discriminatory notions espoused in these recitals according to the terms specified by the settlor would not, in my opinion, be conducive to the public interest. The settlor’s freedom to dispose of his property through the creation of a charitable trust fashioned along these lines must give way to current principles of public policy under which all races and religions are to be treated on a footing of equality and accorded equal regard and equal respect.\nGiven this conclusion, it becomes unnecessary to decide whether the trust is invalid by reason of uncertainty or to consider the questions raised in this regard in para. 23 of Mr. McLeod’s affidavit, which I reproduced earlier. Nor is it necessary to make any determination as to whether other educational scholarships may contravene public policy.\nOn the material before the Court, it appears that many scholarships are currently available to students at colleges and universities in Ontario and elsewhere in Canada which restrict eligibility or grant preference on the basis of such factors as an applicant’s religion, ethnic origin, sex, or language. None, however, so far as the material reveals, is rooted in concepts in any way akin to those articulated here which proclaim, in effect, some students, because of their colour or their religion, less worthy of education or less qualified for leadership than others. I think it inappropriate and indeed unwise to decide in the context of the present case and in the absence of any proper factual basis whether these other scholarships are contrary to public policy or what approach is to be adopted in determining their validity should the issue arise. The Court’s intervention on public-policy grounds in this case is mandated by the, hopefully, unique provisions in the trust document establishing the Leonard Foundation.\nDisposition # To give effect to these reasons, I would strike out the recitals and remove all restrictions with respect to race, colour, creed or religion, ethnic origin and sex as they relate to those entitled to the benefits of the trust and as they relate to the qualifications of those who may be members of the General Committee or give judicial advice and, as well, as they relate to the schools, universities or colleges in which scholarships may be enjoyed. (The provision according preferences to sons and daughters of members of the classes of persons specified in the trust document remains unaffected by this decision.) […]\nTarnopolsky J.A. — # […]\n(2) Is the Trust Void in Whole or in Part Either for Uncertainty or Because it Violates Public Policy # […]\nNext, it is necessary to consider whether the trust could be invalid because of uncertainty. It is important to note that in analyzing the validity of the trust on this basis, the Court may refer only to the operative words, unless they are ambiguous, in which case it can refer to the recitals. Regular rules of statutory construction apply (Re Moon; Ex parte Dawes (1886), 17 Q.B.D. 275, 34 W.R. 753 (C.A.)). Since recitals are descriptions of motive and are normally irrelevant to determining validity, McKeown J. held that they were irrelevant and inoperative. However, it could be argued that many sections of the Indenture refer to the recitals and thereby incorporate them. In fact, McKeown J. noted eight references, after the recitals, to the definition of the class of beneficiaries but then went on to state [at 214-215]:\nAt no time throughout the operative clauses does Colonel Leonard refer back to the three opening recitals; thus his beliefs as stated therein are not incorporated into the operative words and play no part in the interpretation of this instrument.\nWithout deciding whether the recitals are incorporated in the trust instrument by subsequent references to them, I would agree that Colonel Leonard’s beliefs as stated in the opening recitals are evidence of motive and are irrelevant. However, that part of the trust instrument which matters for the purpose of assessing certainty is the second sentence in the first full paragraph on p. 2 of the instrument, which reads as follows:\nFor the above reason the Settlor excludes from the management of, or benefits in the Foundation intended to be created by this Indenture, all who are not Christians of the White Race, all who are not of British Parentage, and all who owe allegiance to any Foreign Government, Prince, Pope or Potentate, or who recognize any such authority, temporal or spiritual.\nThis definition of the class of beneficiaries is a condition precedent. A condition precedent is one in which no gift is intended until the condition is fulfilled. A condition subsequent differs in that non-compliance with the condition will put an end to an already existing gift. A condition precedent will not be void for uncertainty if it is possible to say with certainty that any proposed beneficiary is or is not a member of the class (Jones v. T. Eaton Co., [1973] S.C.R. 635, 35 D.L.R. (3d) 97, at 650-651 [S.C.R.] and McPhail v. Doulton, [1971] A.C. 424, [1970] 2 All E.R. 228 (H.L.) at 456 [A.C.]). It is enough that some claimants can satisfy the condition (Re Selby’s Will Trusts; Donn v. Selby, [1966] 1 W.L.R. 43, [1965] 3 All E.R. 386 (Ch.D.)). The condition will not fail for uncertainty unless it is clearly impossible for anyone to qualify (Re Allen; Faith v. Allen, [1953] Ch. 810, [1953] 2 All E.R. 898 (C.A.), subsequent proceedings [1954] Ch. 259, [1954] 1 All E.R. 526). It is well established that a charitable trust should not fail for uncertainty (see Re Gott, [1944] Ch. 193, [1944] 1 All E.R. 293). Historically, courts have been reluctant to strike down such gifts if it can be avoided. If a condition is uncertain, the court can consider it inoperative, but rarely will a trust fail because of uncertainty if the condition is a condition precedent.\nIn this case, there has been no difficulty over some 6 decades in ascertaining whether students qualify. The clause referred to above is sufficiently certain, except possibly for the “allegiance” exclusion. In my view, however, the clause as a whole meets the requirements established for a condition precedent, and the provisions containing the conditions are sufficiently certain. If I am wrong, however, I would find only the clause referring to “allegiance” to be uncertain and I would hold that it is severable from the other restrictions as to class.\nTurning now to the public-policy issue, it must first be acknowledged that there has been no finding by a Canadian or a British court that at common law a charitable trust established to offer scholarships or other benefits to a restricted class is void as against public policy because it is discriminatory. In some cases, British courts have chosen to delete offensive clauses as “uncertain”, as in Re Lysaght; Hill v. Royal College of Surgeons of England, [1966] Ch. 191, [1965] 2 All E.R. 888; Clayton v. Ramsden, [1943] A.C. 320, [1943] 1 All E.R. 16 (H.L.) and Re Tarnopolsk; Barclay’s Bank Ltd. v. Hyer, [1958] 1 W.L.R. 1157, [1958] 3 All E.R. 479 or “impracticable” as in Re Dominion Students’ Hall Trust, [1947] Ch. 183. In the latter case, the Court found a general charitable intention and then applied the trust property cy-près. The attitude of British courts, however, is probably best summed up in the words of Buckley L.J. in Re Lysaght, supra, at 206, quoted by McKeown J. at 220:\nI accept that racial and religious discrimination is nowadays widely regarded as deplorable in many respects and I am aware that there is a Bill dealing with racial relations at present under consideration by Parliament, but I think that it is going much too far to say that the endowment of a charity, the beneficiaries of which are to be drawn from a particular faith or are to exclude adherents to a particular faith, is contrary to public policy. The testatrix’s desire to exclude persons of the Jewish faith or of the Roman Catholic faith from those eligible for the studentship in the present case appears to me to be unamiable, and I would accept Mr. Clauson’s suggestion that it is undesirable, but it is not, I think, contrary to public policy.\nHowever, in considering these observations of Buckley L.J., it is necessary to keep in mind two points. First, the observations themselves indicate that they were made before the enactment of the first comprehensive statute in the United Kingdom to prohibit discrimination on racial grounds — the Race Relations Act, (U.K.), 1968, c. 71. Second, religion, as a prohibited ground of discrimination, is conspicuously left out of the anti-discrimination laws of the United Kingdom. I do not, therefore, find the English cases on point to be of any help or guidance.\nIn Canada, the leading case on public policy and discrimination at the commencement of World War II was Christie v. York Corp., [1940] S.C.R. 139, [1940] 1 D.L.R. 81, wherein the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada found that denial of service on grounds of race and colour was not contrary to good morals or public order.\nAfter the war, this Court, in Noble and Wolf v. Alley, [1949] O.R. 503, [1949] 4 D.L.R. 375, rev’d [1951] S.C.R. 64, [1951] 1 D.L.R. 321, upheld a racially restrictive covenant in the course of deciding that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that racial discrimination was contrary to public policy in Ontario. In this, the Court specifically overruled Mackay J., in Re Drummond-Wren, [1945] O.R. 778 (H.C.), who had found such covenants void as against public policy. The Supreme Court of Canada struck down the covenant in Noble and Wolf, supra, on technical grounds but did not refer to the public-policy argument.\nSubsequently, in Bhadauria, supra, at 715 [D.L.R.], in concluding that the common law had evolved to the point of recognizing a new tort of discrimination, Wilson J.A. referred to the preamble to the Ontario Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1970, c. 318, the first two paragraphs of which then provided:\nWHEREAS recognition of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world and is in accord with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as proclaimed by the United Nations;\nAND WHEREAS it is public policy in Ontario that every person is free and equal in dignity and rights without regard to race, creed, colour, sex, marital status, nationality, ancestry or place of origin.\nShe then observed: “I regard the preamble to the Code as evidencing what is now, and probably has been for some considerable time, the public policy of this Province respecting fundamental human rights.” That the Human Rights Code recognizes public policy in Ontario was acknowledged a few years later by the Supreme Court of Canada in Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Borough of Etobicoke (1982), 3 C.H.R.R. D/781, 82 C.L.L.C. 17,005, 132 D.L.R. (3d) 14, 40 N.R. 159, at 23-24 [D.L.R.].\nTherefore, even though McKeown J. referred to the caution of Duff C.J.C. in Re Millar, [1938] S.C.R. 1, [1938] 1 D.L.R. 65, at 7-8 [S.C.R.], to the effect that public policy is a doctrine to be invoked only in clear cases where the harm to the public is substantially incontestable and does not depend upon the “idiosyncratic inferences of a few judicial minds,” the promotion of racial harmony, tolerance and equality is clearly and unquestionably part of the public policy of modern day Ontario. I can think of no better way to respond to the caution of Duff C.J.C. than to quote the assertion of Mackay J. of nearly 45 years ago in Re Drummond-Wren, supra, at 783:\nOntario and Canada too, may well be termed a province, and a country, of minorities in regard to the religious and ethnic groups which live therein. It appears to me to be a moral duty, at least, to lend aid to all forces of cohesion, and similarly to repel all fissiparous tendencies which would imperil national unity. The common law courts have, by their actions over the years, obviated the need for rigid constitutional guarantees in our policy by their wise use of the doctrine of public policy as an active agent in the promotion of the public weal. While courts and eminent judges have, in view of the powers of our legislatures, warned against inventing new heads of public policy, I do not conceive that I would be breaking new ground were I to hold the restrictive covenant impugned in this proceeding to be void as against public policy. Rather would I be applying well-recognized principles of public policy to a set of facts requiring their invocation in the interest of the public good.\nFurther evidence of the public policy against discrimination can be found in several statutes in addition to the preamble and content of the Human Rights Code, 1981: s. 13 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 90; s. 4 of the Ministry of Citizenship and Culture Act, 1982, S.O. 1982, c. 6; s. 117 of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 218; and s. 13 of the Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 228. All of these indicate that this particular public policy is not circumscribed by the exact words of the Human Rights Code, 1981, alone. Such a circumscription would make it necessary to alter what the courts would regard as public policy every time an amendment were made to the Human Rights Code. This can be seen just by comparing the wording of the second paragraph of today’s preamble with that considered by Wilson J.A. in 1979 and quoted above. Currently this paragraph reads:\nAND WHEREAS it is public policy in Ontario to recognize the dignity and worth of every person and to provide for equal rights and opportunities without discrimination that is contrary to law, and having as its aim the creation of a climate of understanding and mutual respect for the dignity and worth of each person so that each person feels a part of the community and able to contribute fully to the development and well-being of the community and the Province.\nIt is relevant in this case to refer as well to the “Ontario Policy on Race Relations” (Race Relations Directorate, Ministry of Citizenship) as well as the Premier’s statement in the Legislature concerning the policy (Hansard Official Report of Debates of Legislative Assembly of Ontario, 2nd Session, 33rd Parliament, Wednesday, May 28, 1986, pp. 937-941). The Policy on Race Relations states:\nThe government is committed to equality of treatment and opportunity for all Ontario residents and recognizes that a harmonious racial climate is essential to the future prosperity and social well-being of this province \u0026hellip; The government will take an active role in the elimination of all racial discrimination, including those policies and practices which, while not intentionally discriminatory, have a discriminatory effect \u0026hellip; The government will also continue to attack the overt manifestations of racism and to this end declares that: (a) Racism in any form is not tolerated in Ontario.\nIn introducing it in the Legislature, Premier David Peterson said (Hansard at 937):\nThis policy recognizes that Ontario’s commitment to equality has grown from benign approval to active support. It leaves no doubt that the path we will follow to full racial harmony and equal opportunity is paved, not just with good wishes and best intentions but with concrete plans and active measures.\nPublic policy is not determined by reference to only one statute or even one province, but is gleaned from a variety of sources, including provincial and federal statutes, official declarations of government policy and the Constitution. The public policy against discrimination is reflected in the anti-discrimination laws of every jurisdiction in Canada. These have been given a special status by the Supreme Court of Canada in Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, 52 O.R. (2d) 799 (headnote only), 17 Admin. L.R. 89, 9 C.C.E.L. 185, 7 C.H.R.R. D/3102, 86 C.L.L.C. 17,002, 23 D.L.R. (4th) 321, [1986] D.L.Q. 89 (headnote only), 64 N.R. 161, 12 O.A.C. 241, at 329 [D.L.R.]:\nThe accepted rules of construction are flexible enough to enable the court to recognize in the construction of a human rights code the special nature and purpose of the enactment (see Lamer J. in Insurance Corp. of B.C. v. Heerspink et al. \u0026hellip; [1982] 2 S.C.R. 145 at pp. 157-158 \u0026hellip;), and give to it an interpretation which will advance its broad purposes. Legislation of this type is of a special nature, not quite constitutional, but certainly more than ordinary — and it is for the courts to seek out its purpose and give it effect.\nIn addition, equality rights “without discrimination” are now enshrined in the Constitution Act, 1982 [Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms] in s. 15; the equal rights of men and women are reinforced in s. 28, and the protection and enhancement of our multicultural heritage is provided for in s. 27.\nFinally, the world community has made anti-discrimination a matter of public policy in specific conventions like the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 1965, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, 1979, as well as arts. 2, 3, 25 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, all three of which international instruments have been ratified by Canada with the unanimous consent of all the provinces. It would be nonsensical to pursue every one of these domestic and international instruments to see whether the public-policy invalidity is restricted to any particular activity or service or facility.\nClearly this is a charitable trust which is void on the ground of public policy to the extent that it discriminates on grounds of race, (colour, nationality, ethnic origin) religion and sex.\nSome concern was expressed to us that a finding of invalidity in this case would mean that any charitable trust which restricts the class of beneficiaries would also be void as against public policy. The respondents argued that this would have adverse effects on many educational scholarships currently available in Ontario and other parts of Canada. Many of these provide support for qualified students who could not attend university without financial assistance. Some are restricted to visible minorities, women or other disadvantaged groups. In my view, these trusts will have to be evaluated on a case by case basis, should their validity be challenged. This case should not be taken as authority for the proposition that all restrictions amount to discrimination and are therefore contrary to public policy.\nIt will be necessary in each case to undertake an equality analysis like that adopted by the Human Rights Commission when approaching ss. 1 and 13 of the Human Rights Code, 1981, and that adopted by the courts when approaching s. 15(2) of the Charter. Those charitable trusts aimed at the amelioration of inequality and whose restrictions can be justified on that basis under s. 13 of the Human Rights Code or s. 15(2) of the Charter would not likely be found void because they promote rather than impede the public policy of equality. In such an analysis, attention will have to be paid to the social and historical context of the group concerned (see Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143, 34 B.C.L.R. (2d) 273, 25 C.C.E.L. 255, [1989] 2 W.W.R. 289, 10 C.H.R.R. D/5719, 36 C.R.R. 193, 56 D.L.R. (4th) 1, 91 N.R. 255, at 152-153 [S.C.R.] per Wilson J. and 175 per McIntyre J.) as well as the effect of the restrictions on racial, religious or gender equality, to name but a few examples.\nNot all restrictions will violate public policy, just as not all legislative distinctions constitute discrimination contrary to s. 15 of the Charter (Andrews, supra, at 168-169 per McIntyre J.). In the Indenture in this case, for example, there is nothing contrary to public policy as expressed in the preferences for children of “clergymen”, “school teachers”, etc. It would be hard to imagine in the foreseeable future that a charitable trust established to promote the education of women, aboriginal peoples, the physically or mentally handicapped, or other historically disadvantaged groups would be void as against public policy. Clearly, public trusts restricted to those in financial need would be permissible. Given the history and importance of bilingualism and multiculturalism in this country, restrictions on the basis of language would probably not be void as against public policy, subject, of course, to an analysis of the context, purpose and effect of the restriction.\nIn this case, the Court must, as it does in so many areas of law, engage in a balancing process. Important as it is to permit individuals to dispose of their property as they see fit, it cannot be an absolute right. The law imposes restrictions on freedom of both contract and testamentary disposition. Under the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, s. 22, for instance, covenants that purport to restrict sale, ownership, occupation or use of land because of, inter alia, race, creed or colour are void. Under the Human Rights Code, discriminatory contracts relating to leasing of accommodation are prohibited. With respect to testamentary dispositions, as mentioned earlier, one cannot establish a charitable trust unless it is for an exclusively charitable purpose (see Waters, supra, at 601-603 and 626; and Ministry of Health v. Simpson, supra). Similarly, public trusts which discriminate on the basis of distinctions that are contrary to public policy must now be void.\nA finding that a charitable trust is void as against public policy would not have the far-reaching effects on testamentary freedom which some have anticipated. This decision does not affect private, family trusts. By that I mean that it does not affect testamentary dispositions or outright gifts that are not also charitable trusts. Historically, charitable trusts have received special protection: (1) they are treated favourably by taxation statutes; (2) they enjoy an extensive exemption from the rule against perpetuities; (3) they do not fail for lack of certainty of objects; (4) if the settlor does not set out sufficient directions, the court will supply them by designing a scheme; (5) courts may apply trust property cy-près, providing they can discern a general charitable intention. This preferential treatment is justified on the ground that charitable trusts are dedicated to the benefit of the community (Waters, supra, 502). It is this public nature of charitable trusts which attracts the requirement that they conform to the public policy against discrimination. Only where the trust is a public one devoted to charity will restrictions that are contrary to the public policy of equality render it void.\nAppeal allowed.\n"},{"id":81,"href":"/casebook/governance/cusma/","title":"Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement, Article 14","section":"Chapter 2","content":" Article 14.8: Expropriation and Compensation # 1 No Party shall expropriate or nationalize a covered investment either directly or indirectly through measures equivalent to expropriation or nationalization (expropriation), except:\n(a) for a public purpose;\n(b) in a non-discriminatory manner;\n(c) on payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation in accordance with paragraphs 2, 3, and 4; and\n(d) in accordance with due process of law.\nAnnex 14-6 Expropriation # The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:\n1 An action or a series of actions by a Party cannot constitute an expropriation unless it interferes with a tangible or intangible property right or property interest in an investment.\n2 Article 14.8.1 (Expropriation and Compensation) addresses two situations.

Introduction # Over a century ago, in 1886, the provincial Crown granted the Canadian Pacific Railway Company (”CPR”) a corridor of land for the construction of a railway line from False Creek, in the City of Vancouver (”City”), south to Steveston, on Lulu Island (named after Miss Lulu Sweet, a young actress in the first theatrical company to visit British Columbia). It is this corridor of land, now known as the “Arbutus Corridor”, that lies at the heart of this appeal.\nIn 1902, a railway line was built on the corridor. As the century advanced, traffic declined. From time to time, there was talk of using the corridor for an urban transit line, but nothing came of it and, ultimately, the line was placed elsewhere. In 1999, CPR formally began the process of discontinuing rail operations on the corridor under the Canada Transportation Act, S.C. 1996, c. 10.\nThe Arbutus Corridor has for many years been bounded on both sides and for virtually its entire length by extensive urban development. CPR put forward proposals to develop the corridor for residential and commercial purposes. It also indicated that if the City or any other public body wished to acquire the land, it was willing to sell it at whatever price was determined by agreement or expropriation.\nNothing happened. With increasing vigor, CPR expressed its view that it was intolerable for the City and other governmental bodies to seek to keep the corridor intact without purchasing it. Spirited public debate ensued. The City, as early as 1986, indicated in planning documents and Council resolutions its preference to preserve the corridor for transportation purposes. In the end, the City made it clear that it would not buy the land and adopted the Arbutus Corridor Official Development Plan By-law, City of Vancouver, By-law No. 8249, (25 July 2000) (”ODP By-Law”), that designated the corridor as a public thoroughfare for transportation and “greenways”, like heritage walks, nature trails and cyclist paths.\nThe City’s powers are derived from the Vancouver Charter, S.B.C. 1953, c. 55, an Act of the Legislature of British Columbia, which serves the same purpose as a “municipal act” but applies only to the city of Vancouver (see Appendix A). Development plans under s. 561 of the Vancouver Charter are essentially statements of intention which do not directly affect land owners’ property rights. However, once development plans are adopted as “official” (”ODPs”) under s. 562, they preclude development contrary to the plans: s. 563.\nBuilding on earlier planning documents, the intent of the ODP By-law was “to provide a context for the future of the [corridor]”. More particularly, s. 1.2 stated: “The Arbutus Corridor has been used for many years for a rail line and this plan accommodates this use, but also provides for a variety of other uses.”\nThe by-law outlined the uses to which the corridor could be put (s. 2.1):\nThis plan designates all of the land in the Arbutus Corridor for use only as a public thoroughfare for the purpose only of:\n(a) transportation, including without limitations:\n(i) rail;\n(ii) transit; and\n(iii) cyclist paths\nbut excluding:\n(iv) motor vehicles except on City streets crossing the Arbutus Corridor; and\n(v) any grade-separated rapid transit system elevated, in whole or in part, above the surface of the ground, of which one type is the rapid transit system known as \u0026ldquo;SkyTrain\u0026rdquo; currently in use in the Lower Mainland;\n(b) greenways, including without limitation:\n(i) pedestrian paths, including without limitation urban walks, environmental demonstration trails, heritage walks and nature trails; and\n(ii) cyclist paths.\nThe effect of the by-law was to freeze the redevelopment potential of the corridor and to confine CPR to uneconomic uses of the land. CPR regards this effect as unfair and unreasonable. It does not allege that the City acted in bad faith. However, it argues: (1) that the by-law is ultra vires City and should be struck down; (2) that the City is obligated to compensate CPR for the land; and (3) that the by-law suffers from procedural irregularities and should be struck down on that account.\nThe Chambers Judge held the by-law to be ultra vires the City, declined a declaration that the City must compensate CPR and found it unnecessary to consider the procedural issues ((2002), 33 M.P.L.R. (3d) 214 (B.C. S.C. [In Chambers]). The British Columbia Court of Appeal rejected all three arguments and allowed the City’s appeal ((2004), 26 B.C.L.R. (4th) 220 (B.C. C.A.)). CPR now appeals to this Court. Despite considerable sympathy for CPR’s position, I conclude that under the Vancouver Charter, the City was entitled to refuse compensation and to pass the by-law, and that the courts have no option but to uphold it. I would therefore dismiss the appeal.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n3. Analysis # [\u0026hellip;]\n3.2 Compensation # CPR argues there is a presumption that the Legislature intended any taking of property to be compensated. It argues that the ODP By-law, by limiting its use, constitutes an effective taking of its land. It cannot use the land for any economically viable purpose. It cannot, it says, even run a railway because the by-law precludes maintenance of its track. In these circumstances, the City has effectively “taken” its land and must compensate it, CPR urges.\nLike the Court of Appeal, I am not satisfied that the by-law prevents track maintenance or the operation of a railway on the corridor. Indeed, CPR has no desire to operate a railway there. Its real complaint is that the by-law prevents it from developing or using the corridor for economically profitable purposes. This amounts, it argues, to a de facto taking of its land, requiring compensation.\nCPR argues that at common law, a government act that deprives a landowner of all reasonable use of its land constitutes a de facto taking and imposes an obligation on the government to compensate the landowner.\nFor a de facto taking requiring compensation at common law, two requirements must be met: (1) an acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it, and (2) removal of all reasonable uses of the property (see Mariner Real Estate Ltd. v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General) (1999), 177 D.L.R. (4th) 696 (N.S. C.A.), at p. 716; Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. v. R. (1978), [1979] 1 S.C.R. 101 (S.C.C.); and British Columbia v. Tener, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 533 (S.C.C.).\nIn my view, neither requirement of this test is made out here.\nFirst, CPR has not succeeded in showing that the City has acquired a beneficial interest related to the land. To satisfy this branch of the test, it is not necessary to establish a forced transfer of property. Acquisition of beneficial interest related to the property suffices. Thus, in Manitoba Fisheries, the government was required to compensate a landowner for loss of good will. See also Tener.\nCPR argues that, by passing the ODP By-law, the City acquired a de facto park, relying on the observation of Southin J.A. that “the by-law in issue now can have no purpose but to enable the inhabitants to use the corridor for walking and cycling, which some do (trespassers all), without paying for that use” (para. 117). Southin J.A. went on to say: “The shareholders of \u0026hellip; CPR ought not to be expected to make a charitable gift to the inhabitants” (para. 118). Yet, as Southin J.A. acknowledged, those who now casually use the corridor are trespassers. The City has gained nothing more than some assurance that the land will be used or developed in accordance with its vision, without even precluding the historical or current use of the land. This is not the sort of benefit that can be construed as a “tak[ing]”.\nSecond, the by-law does not remove all reasonable uses of the property. This requirement must be assessed “not only in relation to the land’s potential highest and best use, but having regard to the nature of the land and the range of reasonable uses to which it has actually been put”: see Mariner Real Estate, at p. 717. The by-law does not prevent CPR from using its land to operate a railway, the only use to which the land has ever been put during the history of the City. Nor, contrary to CPR’s contention, does the by-law prevent maintenance of the railway track. Section 559’s definition of “development” is modified by the words “unless the context otherwise requires”. Finally, the by-law does not preclude CPR from leasing the land for use in conformity with the by-law and from developing public/private partnerships. The by-law acknowledges the special nature of the land as the only such intact corridor existing in Vancouver, and expands upon the only use the land has known in recent history.\nCPR also argues that the British Columbia Expropriation Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 125, requires the City to compensate CPR (Appendix B). Section 1 of the Act defines “expropria[tion]” as “the taking of land by an expropriating authority under an enactment without the consent of the owner”, and goes on to define “expropriating authority” as “a person \u0026hellip; empowered under an enactment to expropriate land”. Section 2(1) of the Act provides that “[i]f an expropriating authority proposes to expropriate land, th[e] Act applies to the expropriation, and, if there is an inconsistency between any of the provisions of th[e] Act and any other enactment respecting the expropriation, the provisions of [the Expropriation Act] apply”. The Expropriation Act requires compensation for land expropriated, while the Vancouver Charter states the City is not obliged to compensate for adverse effects to land caused by an ODP. CPR argues that this constitutes an inconsistency and that, under s. 2 of the Expropriation Act, the requirement of compensation in that Act must prevail.\nThis argument rests on the premise that there is an inconsistency between the Expropriation Act and the Vancouver Charter as applied to the facts in this case. It assumes that the land is “expropriate[d]” or “taken” and that the two statutes impose different obligations in this event - compensation in one case, no compensation in the other. In fact, however, the provisions of the Vancouver Charter prevent a conflict from ever arising. Section 569 of the Vancouver Charter provides that property affected by a by-law “shall be deemed as against the city not to have been taken”. The Expropriation Act applies only where there has been a “tak[ing]” or “expropriat[ion]”. Since by statute there is no taking or expropriation here, there is no inconsistency with the Expropriation Act and s. 2(1) cannot apply.\nI add this. Even if the facts of this case could be seen to support an inference of de facto taking at common law, that inference has been conclusively negated by s. 569 of the Vancouver Charter. The Province has the power to alter the common law. Here, by providing that the effects of the ODP By-law cannot amount to a “tak[ing]”, it has rendered inapplicable the common law de facto taking remedy upon which CPR relies.\n[…]\nConclusion # While one may sympathize with CPR’s position, none of its arguments withstand scrutiny. The City did not exceed the powers granted it by the Vancouver Charter. Neither the Vancouver Charter nor principles of common law require it to compensate CPR for the ODP By-law’s effects on its land. Finally, the City’s conduct in enacting the by-law complied with the requirements of fair process.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed.\n"},{"id":83,"href":"/casebook/governance/schoolboard/","title":"City of Toronto v Board of Trustees of R.C. Separate Schools for City of Toronto","section":"Chapter 2","content":" Viscount Cave L.C. — # This appeal raises some important questions as to the relative rights of a School Board acting under the Separate Schools Act of Ontario and a City Council acting under the Municipal Act of that Province. By virtue of the Separate Schools Act, the Board of Trustees of the Roman Catholic Separate Schools for the city of Toronto (who will be referred to in this judgment as the “School Board”) have power to acquire or rent school sites and to build and carry on schools. By virtue of the Municipal Act, the Corporation of the city of Toronto is empowered to prohibit by by-law the use of land or the erection or use of buildings within any defined area for any purpose other than that of a private residence. The question is whether, in the circumstances of this case, a by-law made by the Corporation under the latter statute is enforceable in respect of a site purchased by the School Board for school purposes.\nIn the year 1921 the School Board, having been evicted for the purpose of a street improvement from their school in St. Vincent Street, purchased two adjoining houses with gardens, being Nos. 14 and 18 Prince Arthur Avenue, Toronto, with the object of transferring their scholars to a new school to be erected on that site. No. 14 Prince Arthur Avenue was vacant, and the School Board obtained possession of that property on August 19, 1921; but No. 18 was let to tenants who were subject to a two months’ notice to quit; and actual possession of that property was not obtained until the month of April in the following year. Immediately on obtaining possession of No. 14, the School Board, without depositing plans as required by the municipal by-laws then in force, made some structural alterations in the building with a view to adapting it for temporary use as a school; and subsequently — namely, on September 6 and 9, they deposited plans for these temporary alterations. Prince Arthur Avenue is a residential street, and on September 14 the residents in that street, having heard of the proposal to open a school there, appealed to the Board of Control to intervene; and that Board referred to the City Council the question of making a by-law for preserving the residential character of the street, and instructed the city architect to withhold his approval of the plans deposited by the School Board pending the consideration of this question by the Council. The School Board thereupon acted with great promptness. On September 15 their architect deposited with the city architect plans for the erection of a school extending over the site of Nos. 14 and 18 Prince Arthur Avenue, and on the same day the School Board applied to the Court for a mandamus directing the city architect to consider these plans and to grant a permit both for the temporary alterations and for the erection of a school building upon the entire site. They also opened a school in No. 14 as altered, and by agreement with the tenants of No. 18 obtained possession of a part of the garden at the rear of that house, and caused it to be used as a playground for the scholars.\nOn September 26 the City Council met and under the powers conferred upon them by s. 399A of the Municipal Act, passed a by-law (No. 8834) in the following form:\nI. No person shall use the land fronting or abutting on either side of Prince Arthur Avenue, between Avenue Road and Huron Street, or erect or use any buildings on the said land for any other purpose than that of a detached private residence.\nII. Any person convicted of a breach of any of the provisions of this by-law shall forfeit and pay, at the discretion of the convicting magistrate, a penalty not exceeding (exclusive of costs) the sum of $50 for each offence.\nIII. This by-law shall take effect upon, from and after receiving the approval of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board.\nThis by-law was approved, after arguments on both sides, by the Railway and Municipal Board. The application for a mandamus, having been adjourned in the meantime, was thereupon dismissed by Middleton J.; and an appeal to a Divisional Court against this dismissal was adjourned by that Court sine die to enable the School Board to take proceedings to get the by-law quashed.\nAccordingly, on March 10, 1922, the School Board brought an action against the City Council and their architect, claiming to have the by-law declared invalid or inapplicable and consequential relief. On April 19, 1922, the City Council commenced an action against the School Board, claiming an injunction to restrain that Board from using in breach of by-law No. 8834 the part of its lands not used for school purposes prior to the passing of the by-law, being the front part of No. 18 Prince Arthur Avenue. The two actions were consolidated, and were tried by Middleton J., who dismissed the action brought by the School Board and granted an injunction as asked by the City Council. An appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario against this judgment, and against the refusal of Middleton J. and the Divisional Court to grant a mandamus, was dismissed. The School Board applied for leave to appeal against the decision of the Appellate Division to the Supreme Court of Canada, and such leave was granted on an undertaking by the School Board to abandon as a ground of appeal any contention that the form of the by-law in question in the action, if it was competently enacted, did not correctly follow the statute pursuant to which it was passed, and also any contention that the Municipal Council in passing the by-law acted in bad faith.\nOn the hearing of the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, that Court (Idington J. dissenting) allowed the appeal and made an order that the city architect should consider the application of the School Board for a permit to erect a school building upon the premises Nos. 14 and 18 Prince Arthur Avenue, and should grant a permit for the erection of that building in accordance with the plans and specifications left with the city architect by the Board or as the same might be amended in compliance with the by-laws of the city of Toronto respecting buildings. The reasons for this decision are to be found in the judgment delivered by Duff J. on behalf of the majority of the Court, from which it appears that the decision was based mainly upon the proviso marked (a) contained in s. 399A of the Municipal Act of 1921. That section, after enacting that by-laws might be passed by the councils of cities and other municipalities for prohibiting the use of land or the erection or use of buildings within any defined area or areas abutting on any defined highway or part of highway for any other purpose than that of detached private residence, provided as follows:\n(a) No by-law passed under this section shall apply to any land or building which on the day the by-law is passed is erected or used for any purpose prohibited by the by-law so long as it continues to be used for that purpose, nor shall it apply to any building in course of erection or to any building the plans for which have been approved by the city architect prior to the date of the passing of the by-law, so long as when erected it is used for the purpose for which it was erected.\nAfter referring to this proviso, the learned judge said:\nThe right of the owner of land, therefore, to make use of it, subject to the existing by-laws, in the erection of such buildings upon it as he thinks proper to erect, is preserved inviolate down to the point of time when the restrictive by-law is actually passed; and thereafter, in the limited degree prescribed, in the special cases mentioned. That right, as Middleton J. held in the case already cited, includes the right to receive the necessary permit for the erection of a building proposed to be erected in conformity with the law in force for the time being. It is quite manifest that in the result, if effect be given to the judgments of the Ontario Courts, this right is denied the appellants. The by-law producing this result cannot, in view of the circumstances, in our opinion, be sustained as a valid exercise of the authority given by the statute. The protection of the existing status is a substantive element in the purpose of the enactment. The by-law, passed in the circumstances in which it was passed, necessarily had the effect (and it was so designed) of depriving the appellants of the benefit of a status of which the statute guaranteed the protection. That, in our opinion, is not according to the tenor of the authority created.\nThe learned judge concluded by expressing a hope that, with the co-operation of all parties concerned, it might be possible to make other arrangements which would relieve the residents of the street of the very grave detriment and hardship arising from the presence of the school, the existence of which was not disputed.\nWith the greatest respect for the opinion of the learned judges composing the majority of the Supreme Court, their Lordships are unable to concur in this reasoning. No doubt it is true that, unless and until a by-law restricting the building upon any land is passed, the owner of the land has a right, subject to the existing by-laws, to erect upon it such buildings as he may think proper. But the whole object and purpose of s. 399A is to empower the city authority, acting in good faith, to put restrictions upon that right with a view to the protection of neighbouring owners against that “grave detriment and hardship” to which the learned judge referred; and the “status” or proprietary right of the owner is limited by the powers of the city to be exercised for the protection of his neighbours. If the reasoning of the learned judge is to be taken literally, then in every case the “status” of the building owner is to prevail, and that whether he has or has not deposited plans with a view to building upon his land; and even if the sentences quoted refer only to a case where plans have been deposited before the by-law is passed, they yet go beyond the express terms of the statute. The operation of proviso (a) is confined to cases where at the date of the passing of a by-law either (1.) a building is erected or used for a purpose prohibited by the by-law, or (2.) a building is in course of erection, or (3.) the plans for a building have been approved by the city architect; and it would appear to their Lordships to be a necessary inference from the express terms of the proviso that where plans have been deposited but not yet approved, and the building is not in course of erection, the operation of the by-law is not excluded. There may be a prima facie right to have the deposited plans approved; but if so, that right is negatived by the passing and approval of the by-law. It was suggested that the by-law was defective on the ground that the limitations contained in proviso (a) to the section should have been but were not embodied in the by-law itself; but having regard to the undertaking given by the respondents to abandon any contention that the form of the by-law did not correctly follow the statute, this argument was not open to the respondents on this appeal, and their Lordships accordingly express no opinion upon it.\n[…]\nFor these reasons their Lordships are of opinion that this appeal should be allowed, and that the order of the Supreme Court of Canada should be set aside and the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario restored, and they will humbly advise His Majesty accordingly. The appellants will have their costs in the Supreme Court, but, in accordance with their undertaking, they will pay the costs of this appeal.\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;An unresolved issue "},{"id":84,"href":"/casebook/governance/cobalt/","title":"Cobalt (Town) v Coleman (Township)","section":"Chapter 2","content":" Trotter J.A. – # A. Introduction # This appeal concerns a tract of land (“the property”) situated in the Township of Coleman (“Coleman”), in the District of Timiskaming. The property is owned by the nearby Town of Cobalt (“Cobalt”). Recently, Cobalt has been using the property to conduct a large-scale aggregate extraction operation. Coleman objects to this use, alleging that it is not compliant with its current zoning by-law.\nCobalt brought an application seeking a declaration that its use of the property for aggregate extraction is a permitted use. The application was dismissed. The application judge found that the extraction operation is not a permitted use under Coleman’s zoning by-law and is not a legal non-conforming use pursuant to s. 34(9) of the Planning Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13. In a separate ruling, he awarded Coleman costs, on a partial indemnity scale, in the amount of $85,000 (inclusive of fees, disbursements and taxes).\nCobalt appeals from both orders.\nB. Background # (1) The Property and its Historical Use # The property is 114.67 acres in size. A road runs through the property, cutting it into west and east portions, which are zoned differently. The property was transferred by the Province of Ontario to Cobalt on July 4, 1972 by Letters Patent. The Letters contained the following restriction: “IT IS A CONDITION of these Letters Patent that the Land shall be used only as a municipal park.” This restriction was removed in 2002.\nFrom 1972 to 1997, Cobalt used the property as a municipal park and campground, known as Sharpe Lake Park. While there may have been some quarrying on the property prior to it being acquired by Cobalt, the extent of this activity was unclear. Nevertheless, it had ceased by 1970. As discussed below, any aggregate extraction after 1970 was secondary and incidental to the primary use of the property as a park. The aggregate was used to service the needs of the park, such as creating an entrance road, parking areas, internal roads and camp sites, and for other municipal uses in Cobalt outside of the park (i.e., winter sand).\nFollowing the closure of the park in 1997, Cobalt was unsure about what it wanted to do with the property. At one point, it considered selling it. In 2013, Cobalt entered into an agreement with Miller Paving Ltd. (“Miller”) for Miller to extract aggregate from the property. A large-scale aggregate extraction operation is currently ongoing.\n(2) Applicable Zoning By-Laws # Coleman passed its first zoning by-law in 1985 (85-9). Under this by-law, the entirety of the property was zoned as “Open Space”, with specified residential and non-residential uses. Coleman passed another zoning by-law in 2006 (06-01), replacing the 1985 by-law. Under the 2006 by-law, the western part of the property is zoned as “Development” and only permitted “existing non-residential uses” in the Development zone. The eastern part of the property is zoned “Shoreline Residential”. The only permitted non-residential use is “a marine facility”. This is the portion of the property where commercial aggregate extraction currently takes place.\n(3) The Application Judge’s Reasons # The application judge provided detailed reasons for his decision. I review only those parts of his decision that are necessary to dispose of this appeal.\nThe application judge held that the 2006 by-law does not permit the operation of a pit or quarry on either of the zoned parts of the property.\nAfter conducting a thorough review of the historical use of the property, the application judge explained why Cobalt failed to establish that its current use of the property is a legal non-conforming use. In 1970, before the property was acquired by Cobalt, there was some indication of quarrying having taken place at an earlier time, but this activity had ceased. Referring to the meagre evidence concerning “unworked and terminated” gravel pits, the application judge said, at para. 33: “When they were used, by whom, to what extent they were used, and for what purpose are unknown.”\nThe application judge reviewed Cobalt’s plans to develop the property after the park closed in 1997. Initially, at least, commercial aggregate extraction was not on Cobalt’s radar. By way of example, in its 2001 “Sharpe Lake Proposal”, the Cobalt Economic Development and Planning Committee made no mention of a pit or quarry being on site. A subsequent appraisal obtained by Cobalt for the purpose of potentially selling the property did not mention workable gravel pits or extractive activity. Affidavits from long-time residents, some of whom were involved in municipal affairs, were collectively equivocal. As the application judge said, at para. 42:\n… the affidavits were contradictory as to whether there had been a pit on or extraction from the property. What they reveal is that, if any extraction took place, it was small scale, such that some people were not aware of it, and [it] was done for purposes related to the park or for other municipal purposes. Furthermore, I find that the evidence shows that the extraction was done … in what is now the R4 [Shoreline Residential] zone.\nIn reviewing correspondence between Cobalt and Coleman about the proposed use of the land, which included Coleman’s opposition to aggregate extraction, the application judge referred to an August 23, 2005 letter from Cobalt asserting that there was an existing aggregate pit on the property, and that it appeared to be a legal non-conforming use. The application judge observed, at para. 53: “This appears to be the first time that Cobalt alleged there was an existing pit and that it qualified as a non-conforming use.”\nUltimately, the application judge found that there was no evidence of prior aggregate extraction in the Development zone. With respect to the Shoreline Residential zone, he held that there was evidence of “at least a minimal amount of historical extraction”: at para. 55. This was sufficient to require an assessment to determine whether the current operation is a legal non-conforming use under s. 34(9) of the Planning Act.\nIn undertaking the legal non-conforming use analysis, the application judge applied the relevant authorities, including the leading case of Saint-Romuald (City) v. Olivier, 2001 SCC 57, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 898. He concluded that Cobalt failed to discharge its onus of proving that the commercial extraction operation is a legal non-conforming use.\nThe application judge found that historically there was “limited and small scale” extraction for “municipal purposes” that was conducted on “a small part of the whole property, leaving the rest essentially untouched and available for uses such as the park”: at para. 66. He concluded that: “The use of the property for extraction was secondary and incidental. The essential character of the property was preserved.”\nThe application judge contrasted this historical use with the current commercial operation, which he characterized as “consuming the property”. Importantly, applying Saint-Romuald, he found, at para. 67, that the present use extends beyond a mere intensification of a pre-existing use: “It is a use of a different kind. It is not just a reasonable evolution of a prior activity.”\nLastly, he concluded that the affidavit evidence established “the diminution of people’s enjoyment of the property and of Sharpe Lake itself”: at para. 68.\nAs the successful party, Coleman sought costs on a full indemnity scale, in the amount of $199,329.84. The application judge accepted Cobalt’s submission that Coleman was attempting to recoup fees over the full course of the long-standing dispute between the parties. Based on the costs associated only with the application, he awarded costs of $85,000, on a partial indemnity scale.\nC. Analysis # (1) The Legality of the Aggregate Extraction Operation # The appellant accepts that the application judge properly identified the legal principles concerning legal non-conforming uses. However, it alleges that the application judge failed to properly apply those principles to the facts of this case. I disagree.\nThe appellant contends that the application judge erred by failing to first determine whether the activity presently conducted on the property is permitted by the 2006 by-law before moving to the question of whether the activity is a legal non-conforming use. He made no such error. As noted in para. 7 of these reasons, the only permitted non-residential use in the Shoreline Residential zone is “a marine facility”. In the Development zone, the by-law permits only “existing non-residential uses”. Thus, interpreting the by-law leads directly to an examination of the historical use of the property. The application judge’s reasons at paras. 25 and 69 directly conclude that the current extraction activity is not permitted by the 2006 by-law based on his findings regarding the historical use of the property, and the language of the by-law. On the issue of whether the extraction activity is permitted as a legal non-conforming use, this case involves a straightforward application of Saint-Romuald. Cobalt had the onus of establishing the requirements for a legal non-conforming use: see Feather v. Bradford (Town), 2010 ONCA 440, 268 O.A.C. 239, at paras. 26-27; and Lee v. 1435375 Ontario Ltd_._, 2013 ONCA 516, 310 O.A.C. 187, at para. 46. The application judge found that Cobalt failed to do so.\nAs the application judge recognized, the historical record was far from clear. There were many uncertainties and unanswered questions. There was an evidentiary basis for the application judge to find that, when the 1985 by-law was passed, the essential purpose of the property was its use as a municipal park. Any aggregate extraction was ancillary to this purpose.\nThere was evidence that, once the property was no longer used as a park (post-1997, but prior to the 2006 by-law), Cobalt may have expressed a desire to conduct aggregate extraction. However, it is not the intended use of a property that is important. To prove a legal non-conforming use, it must be shown that the land was actually used for this purpose. As Binnie J. explained in Saint-Romuald, at para. 5: “It does not protect a potential or contemplated use that has never materialized\u0026hellip;The acquired right is no more than a right to carry on using the land for the purpose to which it was in fact previously being put” (emphasis in original).\nThere is no basis to disturb the application judge’s findings that, until 2013, any aggregate extraction that had occurred on the property was minor and incidental, being ancillary to the essential character of the property as a municipal park and campground. On the record before him, the application judge was entitled to reach this conclusion. In doing so, he committed no palpable and overriding error.\nThe central issue in this case is whether the commencement of a large-scale commercial extraction operation was a “mere intensification” of an existing use or use of a different kind. As Binnie J. held in Saint-Romuald, at para. 25: “In general, merely continuing the precise pre-existing activity, even at an intensified level, is clearly protected, but the intensification may be of such a degree as to create a difference in kind.” In more general terms, Binnie J. explained, at para. 34:\nThe Court’s objective is to maintain a fair balance between the individual landowner’s interest and the community’s interest. The landowner overreaches itself if (i) the scale or intensity of the activity can be said to bring about a change in the type of use, as mentioned above, or if (ii) the addition of new activities or the modification of old activities (albeit within the same general land use purpose), is seen by the court as too remote from the earlier activities to be entitled to protection, or if (iii) the new or modified activities can be shown to create undue additional or aggravated problems for the municipality, the local authorities, or the neighbours, as compared with what went before. The factors are balanced against one another. [Emphasis added.] Binnie J. added that this assessment must be grounded in “objective facts”: at para. 39.\nThe application judge’s conclusion that Cobalt had failed to discharge its onus turned on item (i), and to a lesser degree item (iii), in the above-quoted passage from Saint-Romuald. The evidentiary record permitted the application judge to find that the change in use of the property – from a municipal park and campground (with some incidental extraction of sand and gravel) to a large-scale commercial extraction operation – was “a change in the type of use”. He also observed that the change impacted on the community in an adverse way. Although the evidentiary foundation for this second finding was not nearly as robust, I am not able to conclude that the application judge erred in the balancing required by Saint-Romuald.\nThe situation in this case is analogous to the example provided by Binnie J. at para. 25 of Saint-Romuald:\nA family farm which has a few pigs on the fringe of a town may continue as a legal non-conforming use, but the result may be otherwise if it is sought to expand its pork operation into a “factory in the country” type intensive pig farming. While in one sense the “use” has continued, in another sense its character has been so altered as to become, in terms of its impact on the community, an altogether different use. [Emphasis in original.] This example helps to illustrate where the line should be drawn. A determination of whether there is a change in the type of use is not a matter of simply identifying the precise pre-existing use. The character of that use must also be considered. Just as a family pig farm expanded into a pork “factory in the country” becomes a different use, in this case too, the expansion from incidental extraction for municipal purposes to large-scale commercial extraction has altered the character of the use such that it has become a different use altogether.\nThe application judge did not err in concluding that the extraction operation is not a permitted use under Coleman’s zoning by-law and is not a legal non-conforming use under the Planning Act. I would dismiss the appeal from the application judge’s refusal of Cobalt’s request for a declaration.\n(2) Appeal from the Costs Order # As noted above, the application judge awarded Coleman $85,000 in costs, inclusive. Cobalt argues that the proper award is in the range of $40,000.\nI am not persuaded that the application judge made any error in principle, or that the costs order is plainly wrong: see Hamilton v. Open Window Bakery Ltd_._, 2004 SCC 9, [2004] 1 S.C.R 303, at para. 27.\nAlthough the award was substantial, approximately $12,000 was consumed by disbursements. The fees claimed, when considered on a partial indemnity scale, were not disproportionate in the circumstances. I note that the decision resolved a long-standing dispute with a great deal at stake, both monetarily for Cobalt and to the community of Coleman. The application judge’s findings and conclusions on the issue of costs are entitled to deference on appeal: see Boucher v. Public Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario (2004), 2004 CanLII 14579 (ON CA), 71 O.R. (3d) 291 (C.A.), at para. 19. There is no reason to interfere.\nD. Disposition # I would dismiss the appeal. The parties agreed on the quantum of costs payable to the successful party on appeal. Accordingly, I would award costs to Coleman in the amount of $25,000, inclusive of disbursements and applicable taxes.\n"},{"id":85,"href":"/casebook/shelter/committee/","title":"Committee for the Commonwealth of Canada v Canada","section":"Chapter 4","content":"[The following case dealt with the issue of whether restrictions on political activity (distributing leaflets) at an airport as public property were in violation of the applicants\u0026rsquo; freedom of expression protected by the Charter. In the course of their decisions, the judges discussed broader principles applicable to understanding limitations on government ownership of property.]\nL\u0026rsquo;Heureux-Dubé J.

If the government had complete discretion to treat its property as would a private citizen, it could differentiate on the basis of content, or choose between particular viewpoints, and grant access to sidewalks, streets, parks, the courthouse lawn, and even Parliament Hill only to those whose message accorded with the government\u0026rsquo;s preferences. Such a standard would be antithetical to the spirit of the Charter, and would stultify the true import of freedom of expression.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn order to assess whether airport terminals are properly considered public arenas, we must explore their function in contemporary society. Airport terminals are freely accessible to all members of the public. However, the terminals themselves can be divided broadly into security zones — such as Customs, check-in counters, metal detector surveillance areas, and baggage inspection; and non-security zones — such as lounges, waiting areas, restaurants, gift and cigar shops, newsstands, and the connecting halls and foyers. Certain expressive activity is clearly more compatible within the latter areas than within the former.\nAirports also draw a tremendous number of travellers over the course of a day. The Dorval operations manager testified that about 20,000 passengers use the airport daily, often accompanied by other persons. Few locations can parallel this reliable concentration of people. Bus, train and airport terminals are indeed modern boulevards, extensions of Main Street. The list of sites traditionally associated with public expression is not static. As means of locomotion progress, people shall begin to gather in areas heretofore unknown. Hence the \u0026ldquo;traditional\u0026rdquo; component of the public arena analysis must appreciate the \u0026ldquo;type\u0026rdquo; of place historically associated with public discussion, and should not be restricted to the actual places themselves.\nThis same reasoning applies when assessing the symbolic significance of the property. While the symbolism of a courthouse lawn or Parliament Hill is self-evident, streets and parks have also acquired special significance as places where one can have access to and address his or her fellow citizens on any number of matters. This distinctive attribute does not accrue to a street or a park merely because of its designation. A park has no intrinsic value as a public arena; it only obtains this characteristic because the public chooses to frequent parks. Whether a tree falling in an uninhabited park makes a sound is not a constitutional question. To what extent impediments may be placed upon a person addressing passers-by in a park is.\nThe same holds true for airport terminals. Respondents did not select the airport in order to convey their message to planes, but rather chose the airport for the people who would be present within it. While airport terminals do not have a monopoly on high concentrations of passers-by, few locations offer similar opportunities to encounter such a wide cross-section of the community. For the aforementioned reasons, and upon consideration of the above factors, the non-security zones within airport terminals, in my view, are properly regarded as public arenas. Therefore, the government cannot simply assert property rights, or claim that expression is unrelated to an airport\u0026rsquo;s function, in order to justify the restriction.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n"},{"id":86,"href":"/casebook/title/constitution-act-s35/","title":"Constitution Act, 1982","section":"Chapter 3","content":" Section 35 # (1) The existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.\n(2) In this Act, “aboriginal peoples of Canada” includes the Indian, Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada.\n(3) For greater certainty, in subsection (1) “treaty rights” includes rights that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired.

Is there a \u0026ldquo;contemporary\u0026rdquo; legal style, and if so what are its features?\nAs Justin Desautels-Stein has observed, the contemporary style of common law thought is not so much a third alternative to the classical and modern styles we studied in Units 2 and 3, as it is a \u0026ldquo;pragmatic\u0026rdquo; response by jurists to the shortcomings of these two styles that preceded it.1 Unfortunately, the result is not a very satisfying one in terms of coherence or predictability. Whatever their shortcomings, both the classical and modern styles offered internally consistent (if ultimately incomplete) approaches to address the fundamental dilemma of liberalism with which we started our exploration of common law thought. By contrast, the pragmatism embraced in the contemporary style points to a willingness by jurists to draw on, mix and match features of the classical and modern styles—sometimes in the course of a single decision. The result, as Desautels-Stein suggests, is often a kind of \u0026ldquo;whatever works\u0026rdquo; response to the question of what makes the outcome in any given case a persuasive one.\nTo be clear, such a result does not mean that judicial decisions in the contemporary style are devoid of legal reasoning or logic.

The American law loomed large in this area because of its especially strong protections for private property against uncompensated takings.\nNevertheless, other than a small handful of cases prior to the 1990s, the domestic jurisprudence around de facto expropriation remained all but ignored by Canadian judges. It was not until the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal\u0026rsquo;s decision in Mariner Real Estate Ltd. that anything like a recognizable legal test for de facto expropriation began to emerge.\nWhy we\u0026rsquo;re reading it: Mariner establishes much of the legal framework for de facto expropriation embraced by the Supreme Court of Canada in two key cases we\u0026rsquo;ll read later this term.\nWhat to look for: As you read Mariner, below, think about two important aspects.\nIn what ways does Justice Crownwell\u0026rsquo;s decision conform or not to the modern style?\nWhat elements of a legal test for de facto expropriation emerge from the case?\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;What's next After you read Mariner, go back to the Blue Mountain-Birch Cove problem and consider how it might be resolved based on the law you\u0026rsquo;ve learned this week.\nWe will take up the problem together in our class meetings this week. Constructive Expropriation Revisited # Recall that a claim of de facto expropriation is based on the theory that government has undertaken some type of activity that falls short of taking title to land or other property, but which nevertheless is tantamount to expropriation and therefore demands compensation. Since a modern framework for claims of de facto expropriation was articulated in Mariner Real Estate Ltd v Nova Scotia, that framework was subsequently picked up and largely endorsed by the Supreme Court of Canada in Canadian Pacific Railway v Vancouver (City), below. That framework was recently revised in *Annapolis Group Inc. v Halifax Regional Municipality.\nAt roughly the same time as the Supreme Court was addressing this matter in CPR, another set of legal developments was also playing out at the international level under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). NAFTA—an agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico—provides parallel protections for de facto expropriation that are afforded to foreign investors in each of the member states (e.g. Canadian investors in Mexico, or American investors in Canada). These protections, however, are not defined by Canadian domestic law on de facto expropriation as expressed in cases like Mariner Real Estate and CPR. Rather, they are interpreted by an international tribunal that arbitrates claims between private investors and the state party accused of violating the investor\u0026rsquo;s rights. Even more recently—and in part as a response to some of the criticisms of the original NAFTA regime—the NAFTA parties negotiated a new multilateral trade agreement to replace NAFTA. This is the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), signed in 2018.\n"},{"id":91,"href":"/casebook/title/delgamuukw/","title":"Delgamuukw v British Columbia","section":"Chapter 3","content":" Lamer C.J.C \u0026ndash; # II. Facts # A. The Claim at Trial # This action was commenced by the appellants, who are all Gitksan or Wet\u0026rsquo;suwet\u0026rsquo;en hereditary chiefs, who, both individually and on behalf of their \u0026ldquo;Houses\u0026rdquo; claimed separate portions of 58,000 square kilometres in British Columbia. For the purpose of the claim, this area was divided into 133 individual territories, claimed by the 71 Houses. This represents all of the Wet\u0026rsquo;suwet\u0026rsquo;en people, and all but 12 of the Gitksan Houses. Their claim was originally for \u0026ldquo;ownership\u0026rdquo; of the territory and \u0026ldquo;jurisdiction\u0026rdquo; over it. (At this Court, this was transformed into, primarily, a claim for aboriginal title over the land in question.) The province of British Columbia counterclaimed for a declaration that the appellants have no right or interest in and to the territory or alternatively, that the appellants\u0026rsquo; cause of action ought to be for compensation from the Government of Canada.\nB. The Gitksan and Wet\u0026rsquo;suwet\u0026rsquo;en People # (1) Demography # The Gitksan consist of approximately 4,000 to 5,000 persons, most of whom now live in the territory claimed, which is generally the watersheds of the north and central Skeena, Nass and Babine Rivers and their tributaries. The Wet\u0026rsquo;suwet\u0026rsquo;en consist of approximately 1500 to 2000 persons, who also predominantly live in the territory claimed. This territory is mainly in the watersheds of the Bulkley and parts of the Fraser - Nechako River systems and their tributaries. It lies immediately east and south of the Gitksan.\nOf course, the Gitksan and Wet\u0026rsquo;suwet\u0026rsquo;en are not the only people living in the claimed territory. As noted by both McEachern C.J. at trial (at p. 440) and Lambert J.A. on appeal (at p. 243), there are other aboriginals who live in the claimed territory, notably the Carrier-Sekani and Nishga peoples. Some of these people have unsettled land claims overlapping with the territory at issue here. Moreover, there are also numerous non-aboriginals living there. McEachern C.J. found that, at the time of the trial, the non-aboriginal population in the territory was over 30,000.\n(2) History # There were numerous theories of the history of the Gitksan and Wet\u0026rsquo;suwet\u0026rsquo;en peoples before the trial judge. His conclusion from the evidence was that their ancestors migrated from Asia, probably through Alaska, and spread south and west into the areas which they found to be liveable. There was archeological evidence, which he accepted, that there was some form of human habitation in the territory and its surrounding areas from 3500 to 6000 years ago, and intense occupation of the Hagwilget Canyon site (near Hazelton), prior to about 4000 to 3500 years ago. This occupation was mainly in or near villages on the Skeena River, the Babine River or the Bulkley River, where salmon, the staple of their diet, was easily obtainable. The other parts of the territory surrounding and between their villages and rivers were used for hunting and gathering for both food and ceremonial purposes. The scope of this hunting and gathering area depended largely on the availability of the required materials in the areas around the villages. Prior to the commencement of the fur trade, there was no reason to travel far from the villages for anything other than their subsistence requirements.\n(3) North American Exploration # There was little European influence in western Canada until the arrival of Capt. Cook at Nootka on Vancouver Island in 1778, which led to the sea otter hunt in the north Pacific. This influence grew with the establishment of the first Hudson\u0026rsquo;s Bay trading post west of the Rockies (although east of the territories claimed) by Simon Fraser in 1805-1806. Trapping for the commercial fur trade was not an aboriginal practice, but rather one influenced by European contact. The trial judge held that the time of direct contact between the Aboriginal Peoples in the claimed territory was approximately 1820, after the trader William Brown arrived and Hudson\u0026rsquo;s Bay had merged with the North West Company.\n(4) Present Social Organization # McEachern C.J. set out a description of the present social organization of the appellants. In his opinion, this was necessary because \u0026ldquo;one of the ingredients of aboriginal land claims is that they arise from long-term communal rather than personal use or possession of land\u0026rdquo; (at p. 147). The fundamental premise of both the Gitksan and the Wet\u0026rsquo;suwet\u0026rsquo;en people is that they are divided into clans and Houses. Every person born of a Gitksan or Wet\u0026rsquo;suwet\u0026rsquo;en woman is automatically a member of his or her mother\u0026rsquo;s House and clan. There are four Gitksan and four Wet\u0026rsquo;suwet\u0026rsquo;en clans, which are subdivided into houses. Each house has one or more Hereditary Chief as its titular head, selected by the elders of their house, as well as possibly the Head Chief of the other Houses of the clan. There is no head chief for the clans, but there is a ranking order of precedence within communities or villages, where one House or clan may be more prominent than others.\nAt trial, the appellants\u0026rsquo; claim was based on their historical use and \u0026ldquo;ownership\u0026rdquo; of one or more of the territories. The trial judge held that these are marked, in some cases, by physical and tangible indicators of their association with the territories. He cited as examples totem poles with the Houses\u0026rsquo; crests carved, or distinctive regalia. In addition, the Gitksan houses have an \u0026ldquo;adaawk\u0026rdquo; which is a collection of sacred oral tradition about their ancestors, histories and territories. The Wet\u0026rsquo;suwet\u0026rsquo;en each have a \u0026ldquo;kungax\u0026rdquo; which is a spiritual song or dance or performance which ties them to their land. Both of these were entered as evidence on behalf of the appellants (see my discussion of the trial judge\u0026rsquo;s view of this evidence, infra).\nThe most significant evidence of spiritual connection between the Houses and their territory is a feast hall. This is where the Gitksan and Wet\u0026rsquo;suwet\u0026rsquo;en people tell and re-tell their stories and identify their territories to remind themselves of the sacred connection that they have with their lands. The feast has a ceremonial purpose, but is also used for making important decisions. The trial judge also noted the Criminal Code prohibition on aboriginal feast ceremonies, which existed until 1951.\n[After reviewing the history of the case at trial and at the British Columbia Court of Appeal, Chief Justice Lamer went on to address a procedural defect in the appellants\u0026rsquo; pleadings. The appellants on behalf of the Gitksan and Wet’suwet’en nations had initially made a claim for recognition of \u0026ldquo;ownership\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;jurisdiction\u0026rdquo; over their territorial lands. On appeal, the claimants had changed these to claims ones for a declaration of \u0026ldquo;Aboriginal title\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;self-government\u0026rdquo; respectively. No formal amendments had ever been made to the pleadings, however—a situation which British Columbia argued introduced significant prejudice. Chief Justice Lamer agreed and therefore decline to resolve the case on its merits. Nevertheless, the Court took the opportunity in Delgamuukw to elaborate in much more detail that it had previously the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title.]\n[\u0026hellip;]\nV. Analysis # […]\nC. What is the content of aboriginal title, how is it protected by s. 35(1), and what is required for its proof? # (1) Introduction # The parties disagree over whether the appellants have established aboriginal title to the disputed area. However, since those factual issues require a new trial, we cannot resolve that dispute in this appeal. But factual issues aside, the parties also have a more fundamental disagreement over the content of aboriginal title itself, and its reception into the Constitution by s. 35(1). In order to give guidance to the judge at the new trial, it is to this issue that I will now turn.\nI set out these opposing positions by way of illustration and introduction because I believe that all of the parties have characterized the content of aboriginal title incorrectly. The appellants argue that aboriginal title is tantamount to an inalienable fee simple, which confers on aboriginal peoples the rights to use those lands as they choose and which has been constitutionalized by s. 35(1). The respondents offer two alternative formulations: first, that aboriginal title is no more than a bundle of rights to engage in activities which are themselves aboriginal rights recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1), and that the Constitution Act, 1982, merely constitutionalizes those individual rights, not the bundle itself, because the latter has no independent content; and second, that aboriginal title, at most, encompasses the right to exclusive use and occupation of land in order to engage in those activities which are aboriginal rights themselves, and that s. 35(1) constitutionalizes this notion of exclusivity.\nThe content of aboriginal title, in fact, lies somewhere in between these positions. Aboriginal title is a right in land and, as such, is more than the right to engage in specific activities which may be themselves aboriginal rights. Rather, it confers the right to use land for a variety of activities, not all of which need be aspects of practices, customs and traditions which are integral to the distinctive cultures of aboriginal societies. Those activities do not constitute the right per se; rather, they are parasitic on the underlying title. However, that range of uses is subject to the limitation that they must not be irreconcilable with the nature of the attachment to the land which forms the basis of the particular group’s aboriginal title. This inherent limit, to be explained more fully below, flows from the definition of aboriginal title as a sui generis interest in land, and is one way in which aboriginal title is distinct from a fee simple.\n(2) Aboriginal title at common law # (a) General features # The starting point of the Canadian jurisprudence on aboriginal title is the Privy Council’s decision in St. Catharines Milling \u0026amp; Lumber Co. v. R. (1888), 14 App. Cas. 46 (Canada P.C.), which described aboriginal title as a “personal and usufructuary right” (at p.54). The subsequent jurisprudence has attempted to grapple with this definition, and has in the process demonstrated that the Privy Council’s choice of terminology is not particularly helpful to explain the various dimensions of aboriginal title. What the Privy Council sought to capture is that aboriginal title is a sui generis interest in land. Aboriginal title has been described as sui generis in order to distinguish it from “normal” proprietary interests, such as fee simple. However, as I will now develop, it is also sui generis in the sense that its characteristics cannot be completely explained by reference either to the common law rules of real property or to the rules of property found in aboriginal legal systems. As with other aboriginal rights, it must be understood by reference to both common law and aboriginal perspectives.\nThe idea that aboriginal title is sui generis is the unifying principle underlying the various dimensions of that title. One dimension is its inalienability. Lands held pursuant to aboriginal title cannot be transferred, sold or surrendered to anyone other than the Crown and, as a result, is inalienable to third parties. This Court has taken pains to clarify that aboriginal title is only “personal” in this sense, and does not mean that aboriginal title is a non-proprietary interest which amounts to no more than a licence to use and occupy the land and cannot compete on an equal footing with other proprietary interests: see Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Paul, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 654 (S.C.C.) at p. 677.\nAnother dimension of aboriginal title is its source. It had originally been thought that the source of aboriginal title in Canada was the Royal Proclamation, 1763: see St. Catharines Milling. However, it is now clear that although aboriginal title was recognized by the Proclamation, it arises from the prior occupation of Canada by aboriginal peoples. That prior occupation, however, is relevant in two different ways, both of which illustrate the sui generis nature of aboriginal title. The first is the physical fact of occupation, which derives from the common law principle that occupation is proof of possession in law: see Kent McNeil, Common Law Aboriginal Title(1989), at p. 7. Thus, in Guerin, supra, Dickson J. described aboriginal title, at p. 376, as a “legal right derived from the Indians’ historic occupation and possession of their tribal lands”. What makes aboriginal title sui generis is that it arises from possession before the assertion of British sovereignty, whereas normal estates, like fee simple, arise afterward: see Kent McNeil, “The Meaning of Aboriginal Title”, in Michael Asch, ed., Aboriginal and Treaty Rights in Canada (1997), 135, at p. 144. This idea has been further developed in Wewayakum Indian Band v. Canada, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 322 (S.C.C.), where this Court unanimously held at p.340 that “aboriginal title pre-dated colonization by the British and survived British claims to sovereignty” (also see Guerin, supra, at p.378). What this suggests is a second source for aboriginal title — the relationship between common law and pre-existing systems of aboriginal law.\nA further dimension of aboriginal title is the fact that it is held communally. Aboriginal title cannot be held by individual aboriginal persons; it is a collective right to land held by all members of an aboriginal nation. Decisions with respect to that land are also made by that community. This is another feature of aboriginal title which is sui generis and distinguishes it from normal property interests.\n(b) The content of aboriginal title # Although cases involving aboriginal title have come before this Court and Privy Council before, there has never been a definitive statement from either court on the content of aboriginal title. In St. Catharines Milling, the Privy Council, as I have mentioned, described the aboriginal title as a “personal and usufructuary interest”, but declined to explain what that meant because it was not “necessary to express any opinion on the point” (at p.55). Similarly, in Calder, Guerin, and Paul, the issues were the extinguishment of, the fiduciary duty arising from the surrender of, and statutory easements over land held pursuant to, aboriginal title, respectively; the content of title was not at issue and was not directly addressed.\nAlthough the courts have been less than forthcoming, I have arrived at the conclusion that the content of aboriginal title can be summarized by two propositions: first, that aboriginal title encompasses the right to exclusive use and occupation of the land held pursuant to that title for a variety of purposes, which need not be aspects of those aboriginal practices, customs and traditions which are integral to distinctive aboriginal cultures; and second, that those protected uses must not be irreconcilable with the nature of the group’s attachment to that land. For the sake of clarity, I will discuss each of these propositions separately.\nAboriginal title encompasses the right to use the land held pursuant to that title for a variety of purposes, which need not be aspects of those aboriginal practices, cultures and traditions which are integral to distinctive aboriginal cultures.\nThe respondents argue that aboriginal title merely encompasses the right to engage in activities which are aspects of aboriginal practices, customs and traditions which are integral to distinctive aboriginal cultures of the aboriginal group claiming the right and, at most, adds the notion of exclusivity; i.e., the exclusive right to use the land for those purposes. However, the uses to which lands held pursuant to aboriginal title can be put are not restricted in this way. This conclusion emerges from three sources: (i) the Canadian jurisprudence on aboriginal title, (ii) the relationship between reserve lands and lands held pursuant to aboriginal title, and (iii) the Indian Oil and Gas Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-7. As well, although this is not legally determinative, it is supported by the critical literature. In particular, I have profited greatly from Professor McNeil’s article, “The Meaning of Aboriginal Title”, supra.\n(i) Canadian jurisprudence on aboriginal title # Despite the fact that the jurisprudence on aboriginal title is somewhat underdeveloped, it is clear that the uses to which lands held pursuant to aboriginal title can be put is not restricted to the practices, customs and traditions of aboriginal peoples integral to distinctive aboriginal cultures. In Guerin, for example, Dickson J. described aboriginal title as “an interest in land” which encompassed “a legal right to occupy and possess certain lands” (at p. 382). The “right to occupy and possess” is framed in broad terms and, significantly, is not qualified by reference to traditional and customary uses of those lands. Any doubt that the right to occupancy and possession encompasses a broad variety of uses of land was put to rest in Paul, where the Court went even further and stated that aboriginal title was “more than the right to enjoyment and occupancy” (at p. 688). Once again, there is no reference to aboriginal practices, customs and traditions as a qualifier on that right. Moreover, I take the reference to “more” as emphasis of the broad notion of use and possession.\n(ii) Reserve Land # Another source of support for the conclusion that the uses to which lands held under aboriginal title can be put are not restricted to those grounded in practices, customs and traditions integral to distinctive aboriginal cultures can be found in Guerin, where Dickson J. stated at p.379 that the same legal principles governed the aboriginal interest in reserve lands and lands held pursuant to aboriginal title:\nIt does not matter, in my opinion, that the present case is concerned with the interest of an Indian Band in a reserve rather than with unrecognized aboriginal title in traditional tribal lands. The Indian interest in the lands is the same in both cases….. [Emphasis added.]\nThe nature of the Indian interest in reserve land is very broad, and can found in s. 18 of the Indian Act, which I reproduce in full:\n18.(1) Subject to this Act, reserves are held by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of the respective bands for which they were set apart, and subject to this Act and to the terms of any treaty or surrender, the Governor in Council may determine whether any purpose for which lands in a reserve are used or are to be used is for the use and benefit of the band.\n(2) The Minister may authorize the use of lands in a reserve for the purpose of Indian schools, the administration of Indian affairs, Indian burial grounds, Indian health projects or, with the consent of the council of the band, for any other purpose for the general welfare of the band, and may take any lands in a reserve required for those purposes, but where an individual Indian, immediately prior to the taking, was entitled to the possession of those lands, compensation for that use shall be paid to the Indian, in such amount as may be agreed between the Indian and the Minister, or, failing agreement, as may be determined in such manner as the Minister may direct. [Emphasis added.]\nThe principal provision is s. 18(1), which states that reserve lands are held “for the use and benefit” of the bands which occupy them; those uses and benefits, on the face of the Indian Act, do not appear to be restricted to practices, customs and traditions integral to distinctive aboriginal cultures. The breadth of those uses is reinforced by s. 18(2), which states that reserve lands may be used “for any other purpose for the general welfare of the band”. The general welfare of the band has not been defined in terms of aboriginal practices, customs and traditions, nor in terms of those activities which have their origin pre-contact; it is a concept, by definition, which incorporates a reference to the present-day needs of aboriginal communities. On the basis of Guerin, lands held pursuant to aboriginal title, like reserve lands, are also capable of being used for a broad variety of purposes.\n(iii) Indian Oil and Gas Act # The third source for the proposition that the content of aboriginal title is not restricted to practices, customs, and traditions which are integral to distinctive aboriginal cultures is the Indian Oil and Gas Act. The overall purpose of the statute is to provide for the exploration of oil and gas on reserve lands through their surrender to the Crown. The statute presumes that the aboriginal interest in reserve land includes mineral rights, a point which this Court unanimously accepted with respect to the *Indian Act in Apsassin v. Canada *(Department of Indian Affairs \u0026amp; Northern Development),[1995] 4 S.C.R. 344 (S.C.C.). On the basis of Guerin, aboriginal title also encompass mineral rights, and lands held pursuant to aboriginal title should be capable of exploitation in the same way, which is certainly not a traditional use for those lands. This conclusion is reinforced by s. 6(2) of the Act, which provides:\n6 … (2) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to abrogate the rights of Indian people or preclude them from negotiating for oil and gas benefits in those areas in which land claims have not been settled.\nThe areas referred to in s. 6(2), at the very least, must encompass lands held pursuant to aboriginal title, since those lands by definition have not been surrendered under land claims agreements. The presumption underlying s. 6(2) is that aboriginal title permits the development of oil and gas reserves.\nAlthough this is not determinative, the conclusion that the content of aboriginal title is not restricted to those uses with their origins in the practices, customs and traditions integral to distinctive aboriginal societies has wide support in the critical literature: Jocelyn Gagne, “The Content of Aboriginal Title at Common Law: A Look at the Nishga Claim” (1982-83), 47 Sask. Law Rev. 309 at pp. 336-37; Kent McNeil, Common Law Aboriginal Title, supra, at p. 242; Kent McNeil, “The Meaning of Aboriginal Title”, supra, at pp. 143-150; William Pentney, “The Rights of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada in the Constitution Act, 1982 Part II — Section 35: The Substantive Guarantee” (1988), 22 U.B.C. Law Rev. 207, at pp. 221; Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, vol. 2, Restructuring the Relationship, at pp. 561; Brian Slattery, “The Constitutional Guarantee of Aboriginal and Treaty Rights” (1982-83), 8 Queen’s L.J. 232, at pp. 268-9; Brian Slattery, Ancestral Lands, Alien Laws: Judicial Perspectives on Aboriginal Title (1983) at pp. 34; Brian Slattery, “Understanding Aboriginal Rights”, supra, at pp. 746-48.\nIn conclusion, the content of aboriginal title is not restricted to those uses which are elements of a practice, custom or tradition integral to the distinctive culture of the aboriginal group claiming the right. However, nor does aboriginal title amount to a form of inalienable fee simple, as I will now explain.\n(c) Inherent Limit # The content of aboriginal title contains an inherent limit that lands held pursuant to title cannot be used in a manner that is irreconcilable with the nature of the claimants’ attachment to those lands. This limit on the content of aboriginal title is a manifestation of the principle that underlies the various dimensions of that special interest in land \u0026ndash; it is a sui generis interest that is distinct from “normal” proprietary interests, most notably fee simple.\nI arrive at this conclusion by reference to the other dimensions of aboriginal title which are sui generis as well. I first consider the source of aboriginal title. As I discussed earlier, aboriginal title arises from the prior occupation of Canada by aboriginal peoples. That prior occupation is relevant in two different ways: first, because of the physical fact of occupation, and second, because aboriginal title originates in part from pre-existing systems of aboriginal law. However, the law of aboriginal title does not only seek to determine the historic rights of aboriginal peoples to land; it also seeks to afford legal protection to prior occupation in the present-day. Implicit in the protection of historic patterns of occupation is a recognition of the importance of the continuity of the relationship of an aboriginal community to its land over time.\nI develop this point below with respect to the test for aboriginal title. The relevance of the continuity of the relationship of an aboriginal community with its land here is that it applies not only to the past, but to the future as well. That relationship should not be prevented from continuing into the future. As a result, uses of the lands that would threaten that future relationship are, by their very nature, excluded from the content of aboriginal title.\nAccordingly, in my view, lands subject to aboriginal title cannot be put to such uses as may be irreconcilable with the nature of the occupation of that land and the relationship that the particular group has had with the land which together have given rise to aboriginal title in the first place. As discussed below, one of the critical elements in the determination of whether a particular aboriginal group has aboriginal title to certain lands is the matter of the occupancy of those lands. Occupancy is determined by reference to the activities that have taken place on the land and the uses to which the land has been put by the particular group. If lands are so occupied, there will exist a special bond between the group and the land in question such that the land will be part of the definition of the group’s distinctive culture. It seems to me that these elements of aboriginal title create an inherent limitation on the uses to which the land, over which such title exists, may be put. For example, if occupation is established with reference to the use of the land as a hunting ground, then the group that successfully claims aboriginal title to that land may not use it in such a fashion as to destroy its value for such a use (e.g., by strip mining it). Similarly, if a group claims a special bond with the land because of its ceremonial or cultural significance, it may not use the land in such a way as to destroy that relationship (e.g., by developing it in such a way that the bond is destroyed, perhaps by turning it into a parking lot).\nIt is for this reason also that lands held by virtue of aboriginal title may not be alienated. Alienation would bring to an end the entitlement of the aboriginal people to occupy the land and would terminate their relationship with it. I have suggested above that the inalienability of aboriginal lands is, at least in part, a function of the common law principle that settlers in colonies must derive their title from Crown grant and, therefore, cannot acquire title through purchase from aboriginal inhabitants. It is also, again only in part, a function of a general policy “to ensure that Indians are not dispossessed of their entitlements”: see Mitchell v. Sandy Bay Indian Band, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 85 (S.C.C.) at p. 133. What the inalienability of lands held pursuant to aboriginal title suggests is that those lands are more than just a fungible commodity. The relationship between an aboriginal community and the lands over which it has aboriginal title has an important non-economic component. The land has an inherent and unique value in itself, which is enjoyed by the community with aboriginal title to it. The community cannot put the land to uses which would destroy that value.\nI am cognizant that the sui generis nature of aboriginal title precludes the application of “traditional real property rules” to elucidate the content of that title (St. Mary’s Indian Band v. Cranbrook (City), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 657 (S.C.C.) at para. 14). Nevertheless, a useful analogy can be drawn between the limit on aboriginal title and the concept of equitable waste at common law. Under that doctrine, persons who hold a life estate in real property cannot commit “wanton or extravagant acts of destruction” (E. H. Burn, Cheshire and Burn’s Modern Law of Real Property (14th ed. 1988), at p. 264) or “ruin the property” (Robert E. Megarry and H. W. R. Wade, The Law of Real Property, 4th ed. (1975) at p. 105). This description of the limits imposed by the doctrine of equitable waste capture the kind of limit I have in mind here.\nFinally, what I have just said regarding the importance of the continuity of the relationship between an aboriginal community and its land, and the non-economic or inherent value of that land, should not be taken to detract from the possibility of surrender to the Crown in exchange for valuable consideration. On the contrary, the idea of surrender reinforces the conclusion that aboriginal title is limited in the way I have described. If aboriginal peoples wish to use their lands in a way that aboriginal title does not permit, then they must surrender those lands and convert them into non-title lands to do so.\nThe foregoing amounts to a general limitation on the use of lands held by virtue of aboriginal title. It arises from the particular physical and cultural relationship that a group may have with the land and is defined by the source of aboriginal title over it. This is not, I must emphasize, a limitation that restricts the use of the land to those activities that have traditionally been carried out on it. That would amount to a legal straitjacket on aboriginal peoples who have a legitimate legal claim to the land. The approach I have outlined above allows for a full range of uses of the land, subject only to an overarching limit, defined by the special nature of the aboriginal title in that land.\n(d) Aboriginal title under s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 # Aboriginal title at common law is protected in its full form by s. 35(1). This conclusion flows from the express language of s. 35(1) itself, which states in full: “[t]he existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed” (emphasis added). On a plain reading of the provision, s. 35(1) did not create aboriginal rights; rather, it accorded constitutional status to those rights which were “existing” in 1982. The provision, at the very least, constitutionalized those rights which aboriginal peoples possessed at common law, since those rights existed at the time s. 35(1) came into force. Since aboriginal title was a common law right whose existence was recognized well before 1982 (e.g., Calder, supra), s. 35(1) has constitutionalized it in its full form.\nI expressed this understanding of the relationship between common law aboriginal rights, including aboriginal title, and the aboriginal rights protected by s. 35(1) in Vanderpeet. While explaining the purposes behind s. 35(1), I stated that “it must be remembered that s. 35(1) did not create the legal doctrine of aboriginal rights; aboriginal rights existed and were recognized under the common law” (at para. 28). Through the enactment of s. 35(1), “a pre-existing legal doctrine was elevated to constitutional status” (at para. 29), or in other words, s. 35(1) had achieved “the constitutionalization of those rights” (at para. 29).\nFinally, this view of the effect of s. 35(1) on common law aboriginal title is supported by numerous commentators: Patrick Macklem, “First Nations Self-Government and the Borders of the Canadian Legal Imagination” (1991), 36 McGill L.J. 382, at pp. 447-48; Kent McNeil, “The Constitutional Rights of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada” (1982), 4 Sup. Ct. L. Rev. 255, at pp. 256-57; James O’Reilly, “La Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 droit des autochtones” (1984) 25 C. De D. 125, at p.137; William Pentney, “The Rights of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada in the Constitution Act, 1982 Part II - Section 35: The Substantive Guarantee”, supra, at pp. 220-21; Douglas Sanders, “The Rights of the Aboriginal Peoples of Canada” (1983), 61 Can. Bar Rev. 314, at p. 329; Douglas Sanders, “Pre-Existing Rights: The Aboriginal Peoples of Canada”, in Gérald-A. Beaudoin \u0026amp; Ed Ratushny, eds., The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (2nd ed. 1989), at pp. 731-32; Brian Slattery, “The Constitutional Guarantee of Aboriginal Treaty Rights”, supra, at p. 254; Brian Slattery, Ancestral Lands, Alien Laws: Judicial Perspectives on Aboriginal Title, supra, at p. 45.\nI hasten to add that the constitutionalization of common law aboriginal rights by s. 35(1) does not mean that those rights exhaust the content of s. 35(1). As I said in Côté, supra, at para. 52:\n[s]ection 35(1) would fail to achieve its noble purpose of preserving the integral and defining features of distinctive aboriginal societies if it only protected those defining features which were fortunate enough to have received the legal recognition and approval of European colonizers.\nI relied on this proposition in Côté to defeat the argument that the possible absence of aboriginal rights under French colonial law was a bar to the existence of aboriginal rights under s. 35(1) within the historic boundaries of New France. But it also follows that the existence of a particular aboriginal right at common law is not a sine qua non for the proof of an aboriginal right that is recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1). Indeed, none of the decisions of this Court handed down under s. 35(1) in which the existence of an aboriginal right has been demonstrated has relied on the existence of that right at common law. The existence of an aboriginal right at common law is therefore sufficient, but not necessary, for the recognition and affirmation of that right by s. 35(1).\nThe acknowledgement that s. 35(1) has accorded constitutional status to common law aboriginal title raises a further question — the relationship of aboriginal title to the “aboriginal rights” protected by s. 35(1). I addressed that question in Adams, supra, where the Court had been presented with two radically different conceptions of this relationship. The first conceived of aboriginal rights as being “inherently based in aboriginal title to the land” (at para. 25), or as fragments of a broader claim to aboriginal title. By implication, aboriginal rights must rest either in a claim to title or the unextinguished remnants of title. Taken to its logical extreme, this suggests that aboriginal title is merely the sum of a set of individual aboriginal rights, and that it therefore has no independent content. However, I rejected this position for another — that aboriginal title is “simply one manifestation of a broader-based conception of aboriginal rights” (at para. 25). Thus, although aboriginal title is a species of aboriginal right recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1), it is distinct from other aboriginal rights because it arises where the connection of a group with a piece of land “was of a central significance to their distinctive culture” (at para. 26).\nThe picture which emerges from Adams is that the aboriginal rights which are recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1) fall along a spectrum with respect to their degree of connection with the land. At the one end, there are those aboriginal rights which are practices, customs and traditions that are integral to the distinctive aboriginal culture of the group claiming the right. However, the “occupation and use of the land” where the activity is taking place is not “sufficient to support a claim of title to the land” (at para. 26). Nevertheless, those activities receive constitutional protection. In the middle, there are activities which, out of necessity, take place on land and indeed, might be intimately related to a particular piece of land. Although an aboriginal group may not be able to demonstrate title to the land, it may nevertheless have a site-specific right to engage in a particular activity. I put the point this way in Adams, at para. 30:\nEven where an aboriginal right exists on a tract of land to which the aboriginal people in question do not have title, that right may well be site specific, with the result that it can be exercised only upon that specific tract of land. For example, if an aboriginal people demonstrates that hunting on a specific tract of land was an integral part of their distinctive culture then, even if the right exists apart from title to that tract of land, the aboriginal right to hunt is nonetheless defined as, and limited to, the right to hunt on the specific tract of land. [Emphasis added.]\nAt the other end of the spectrum, there is aboriginal title itself. As Adams makes clear, aboriginal title confers more than the right to engage in site-specific activities which are aspects of the practices, customs and traditions of distinctive aboriginal cultures. Site-specific rights can be made out even if title cannot. What aboriginal title confers is the right to the land itself.\nBecause aboriginal rights can vary with respect to their degree of connection with the land, some aboriginal groups may be unable to make out a claim to title, but will nevertheless possess aboriginal rights that are recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1), including site-specific rights to engage in particular activities. As I explained in Adams, this may occur in the case of nomadic peoples who varied “the location of their settlements with the season and changing circumstances” (at para. 27). The fact that aboriginal peoples were non-sedentary, however (at para. 27):\ndoes not alter the fact that nomadic peoples survived through reliance on the land prior to contact with Europeans and, further, that many of the practices, customs and traditions of nomadic peoples that took place on the land were integral to their distinctive cultures.\n(e) Proof of Aboriginal title # (i) Introduction # In addition to differing in the degree of connection with the land, aboriginal title differs from other aboriginal rights in another way. To date, the Court has defined aboriginal rights in terms of activities. As I said in Vanderpeet (at para. 46):\nin order to be an aboriginal right an activity must be an element of a practice, custom or tradition integral to the distinctive culture of the aboriginal group claiming the right. [Emphasis added.]\nAboriginal title, however, is a right to the land itself. Subject to the limits I have laid down above, that land may be used for a variety of activities, none of which need be individually protected as aboriginal rights under s. 35(1). Those activities are parasitic on the underlying title.\nThis difference between aboriginal rights to engage in particular activities and aboriginal title requires that the test I laid down in Vanderpeet be adapted accordingly. I anticipated this possibility in Vanderpeet itself, where I stated that (at para. 74):\nAboriginal rights arise from the prior occupation of land, but they also arise from the prior social organization and distinctive cultures of aboriginal peoples on that land. In considering whether a claim to an aboriginal right has been made out, courts must look at both the relationship of an aboriginal claimant to the land and [emphasis in original] at the practices, customs and traditions arising from the claimant’s distinctive culture and society. Courts must not focus so entirely on the relationship of aboriginal peoples with the land that they lose sight of the other factors relevant to the identification and definition of aboriginal rights. [Emphasis added.]\nSince the purpose of s. 35(1) is to reconcile the prior presence of aboriginal peoples in North America with the assertion of Crown sovereignty, it is clear from this statement that s. 35(1) must recognize and affirm both aspects of that prior presence — first, the occupation of land, and second, the prior social organization and distinctive cultures of aboriginal peoples on that land. To date the jurisprudence under s. 35(1) has given more emphasis to the second aspect. To a great extent, this has been a function of the types of cases which have come before this Court under s. 35(1) — prosecutions for regulatory offences that, by their very nature, proscribe discrete types of activity.\nThe adaptation of the test laid down in Vanderpeet to suit claims to title must be understood as the recognition of the first aspect of that prior presence. However, as will now become apparent, the tests for the identification of aboriginal rights to engage in particular activities and for the identification of aboriginal title share broad similarities. The major distinctions are first, under the test for aboriginal title, the requirement that the land be integral to the distinctive culture of the claimants is subsumed by the requirement of occupancy, and second, whereas the time for the identification of aboriginal rights is the time of first contact, the time for the identification of aboriginal title is the time at which the Crown asserted sovereignty over the land.\n(ii) The test for the proof of Aboriginal title # In order to make out a claim for aboriginal title, the aboriginal group asserting title must satisfy the following criteria: (i) the land must have been occupied prior to sovereignty, (ii) if present occupation is relied on as proof of occupation pre-sovereignty, there must be a continuity between present and pre-sovereignty occupation, and (iii) at sovereignty, that occupation must have been exclusive.\nThe land must have been occupied prior to sovereignty.\nIn order to establish a claim to aboriginal title, the aboriginal group asserting the claim must establish that it occupied the lands in question at the time at which the Crown asserted sovereignty over the land subject to the title. The relevant time period for the establishment of title is, therefore, different than for the establishment of aboriginal rights to engage in specific activities. In Vanderpeet, I held, at para. 60 that “[t]he time period that a court should consider in identifying whether the right claimed meets the standard of being integral to the aboriginal community claiming the right is the period prior to contact….”. This arises from the fact that in defining the central and distinctive attributes of pre-existing aboriginal societies it is necessary to look to a time prior to the arrival of Europeans. Practices, customs or traditions that arose solely as a response to European influences do not meet the standard for recognition as aboriginal rights.\nOn the other hand, in the context of aboriginal title, sovereignty is the appropriate time period to consider for several reasons. First, from a theoretical standpoint, aboriginal title arises out of prior occupation of the land by aboriginal peoples and out of the relationship between the common law and pre-existing systems of aboriginal law. Aboriginal title is a burden on the Crown’s underlying title. However, the Crown did not gain this title until it asserted sovereignty over the land in question. Because it does not make sense to speak of a burden on the underlying title before that title existed, aboriginal title crystallized at the time sovereignty was asserted. Second, aboriginal title does not raise the problem of distinguishing between distinctive, integral aboriginal practices, customs and traditions and those influenced or introduced by European contact. Under common law, the act of occupation or possession is sufficient to ground aboriginal title and it is not necessary to prove that the land was a distinctive or integral part of the aboriginal society before the arrival of Europeans. Finally, from a practical standpoint, it appears that the date of sovereignty is more certain than the date of first contact. It is often very difficult to determine the precise moment that each aboriginal group had first contact with European culture. I note that this is the approach has support in the academic literature: Brian Slattery, “Understanding Aboriginal Rights”, supra, at p. 742; Kent McNeil, Common Law Aboriginal Title, supra, at p. 196. For these reasons, I conclude that aboriginals must establish occupation of the land from the date of the assertion of sovereignty in order to sustain a claim for aboriginal title. McEachern C.J. found, at pp. 233-34, and the parties did not dispute on appeal, that British sovereignty over British Columbia was conclusively established by the Oregon Boundary Treaty of 1846. This is not to say that circumstances subsequent to sovereignty may never be relevant to title or compensation; this might be the case, for example, where native bands have been dispossessed of traditional lands after sovereignty.\nThere was a consensus among the parties on appeal that proof of historic occupation was required to make out a claim to aboriginal title. However, the parties disagreed on how that occupancy could be proved. The respondents assert that in order to establish aboriginal title, the occupation must be the physical occupation of the land in question. The appellant Gitksan nation argue, by contrast, that aboriginal title may be established, at least in part, by reference to aboriginal law.\nThis debate over the proof of occupancy reflects two divergent views of the source of aboriginal title. The respondents argue, in essence, that aboriginal title arises from the physical reality at the time of sovereignty, whereas the Gitksan effectively take the position that aboriginal title arises from and should reflect the pattern of land holdings under aboriginal law. However, as I have explained above, the source of aboriginal title appears to be grounded both in the common law and in the aboriginal perspective on land; the latter includes, but is not limited to, their systems of law. It follows that both should be taken into account in establishing the proof of occupancy. Indeed, there is precedent for doing so. In Baker Lake (Hamlet), supra, Mahoney J. held that to prove aboriginal title, the claimants needed both to demonstrate their “physical presence on the land they occupied” (at p. 561) and the existence “among [that group of] \u0026hellip; a recognition of the claimed rights\u0026hellip; by the regime that prevailed before” (at p. 559).\nThis approach to the proof of occupancy at common law is also mandated in the context of s. 35(1) by Vanderpeet. In that decision, as I stated above, I held at para. 50 that the reconciliation of the prior occupation of North America by aboriginal peoples with the assertion of Crown sovereignty required that account be taken of the “aboriginal perspective while at the same time taking into account the perspective of the common law” and that “[t]rue reconciliation will, equally, place weight on each”. I also held that the aboriginal perspective on the occupation of their lands can be gleaned, in part, but not exclusively, from their traditional laws, because those laws were elements of the practices, customs and traditions of aboriginal peoples: at para. 41. As a result, if, at the time of sovereignty, an aboriginal society had laws in relation to land, those laws would be relevant to establishing the occupation of lands which are the subject of a claim for aboriginal title. Relevant laws might include, but are not limited to, a land tenure system or laws governing land use.\nHowever, the aboriginal perspective must be taken into account alongside the perspective of the common law. Professor McNeil has convincingly argued that at common law, the fact of physical occupation is proof of possession at law, which in turn will ground title to the land: Common Law Aboriginal Title, supra, at p. 73; also see Cheshire and Burn, Modern Law of Real Property, supra, at p. 28; and Megarry and Wade, The Law of Real Property, supra, at p. 1006. Physical occupation may be established in a variety of ways, ranging from the construction of dwellings through cultivation and enclosure of fields to regular use of definite tracts of land for hunting, fishing or otherwise exploiting its resources: see McNeil, Common Law Aboriginal Title, supra at pp. 201-202. In considering whether occupation sufficient to ground title is established, “one must take into account the group’s size, manner of life, material resources, and technological abilities, and the character of the lands claimed”: Brian Slattery, “Understanding Aboriginal Rights”, at pp. 758.\nIn Vanderpeet, I drew a distinction between those practices, customs and traditions of aboriginal peoples which were “an aspect of, or took place in” the society of the aboriginal group asserting the claim and those which were “a central and significant part of the society’s culture” (at para. 55). The latter stood apart because they “made the culture of that society distinctive \u0026hellip; it was one of the things which truly made the society what it was” (at para. 55). The same requirement operates in the determination of the proof of aboriginal title. As I said in Adams, a claim to title is made out when a group can demonstrate “that their connection with the piece of land \u0026hellip; was of central significance to their distinctive culture” (at para. 26).\nAlthough this remains a crucial part of the test for aboriginal rights, given the occupancy requirement in the test for aboriginal title, I cannot imagine a situation where this requirement would actually serve to limit or preclude a title claim. The requirement exists for rights short of title because it is necessary to distinguish between those practices which were central to the culture of claimants and those which were more incidental. However, in the case of title, it would seem clear that any land that was occupied pre-sovereignty, and which the parties have maintained a substantial connection with since then, is sufficiently important to be of central significance to the culture of the claimants. As a result, I do not think it is necessary to include explicitly this element as part of the test for aboriginal title. …\n[Chief Justice Lamer went on to analyze the second and third prongs of the test for proof of Aboriginal title: (ii) if present occupation is relied on as proof of occupation pre-sovereignty, there must be a continuity between present and pre-sovereignty occupation, and (iii) at sovereignty, that occupation must have been exclusive. The Chief Justice also discussed the possibility of Crown infringement of Aboriginal title once that has been successfully proven. These elements are described in more detail in Tsilhqot\u0026rsquo;in Nation v British Columbia, below]\nVI. Conclusion and Disposition # For the reasons I have given above, I would allow the appeal in part, and dismiss the cross-appeal. Reluctantly, I would also order a new trial.\nI conclude with two observations. The first is that many aboriginal nations with territorial claims that overlap with those of the appellants did not intervene in this appeal, and do not appear to have done so at trial. This is unfortunate, because determinations of aboriginal title for the Gitksan and Wet’suwet’en will undoubtedly affect their claims as well. This is particularly so because aboriginal title encompasses an exclusive right to the use and occupation of land, i.e., to the exclusion of both non-aboriginals and members of other aboriginal nations. It may, therefore, be advisable if those aboriginal nations intervened in any new litigation.\nFinally, this litigation has been both long and expensive, not only in economic but in human terms as well. By ordering a new trial, I do not necessarily encourage the parties to proceed to litigation and to settle their dispute through the courts. As was said in Sparrow, at p. 1105, s. 35(1) “provides a solid constitutional base upon which subsequent negotiations can take place”. Those negotiations should also include other aboriginal nations which have a stake in the territory claimed. Moreover, the Crown is under a moral, if not a legal, duty to enter into and conduct those negotiations in good faith. Ultimately, it is through negotiated settlements, with good faith and give and take on all sides, reinforced by the judgments of this Court, that we will achieve what I stated in Vanderpeet, supra, at para. 31, to be a basic purpose of s. 35(1) — “the reconciliation of the pre-existence of aboriginal societies with the sovereignty of the Crown”. Let us face it, we are all here to stay.\n"},{"id":92,"href":"/casebook/title/downey/","title":"Downey v Nova Scotia (Attorney General)","section":"Chapter 3","content":" Campbell J. — # [\u0026hellip;]\nThe Land Titles Clarification Act # On November 24, 2017 Mr. Downey filed an application for land titles clarification under the Land Titles Clarification Act with respect to a property at 39 Beals Crescent in North Preston. The history, context and purpose of that legislation has been reviewed in detail by my colleague Justice Bodurtha in Beals v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), 2020 NSSC 60 (N.S. S.C.).\nAfrican Nova Scotians have been subjected to racism for hundreds of years in this province. It is embedded within the systems that govern how our society operates. That is a fundamental historical fact and an observation of present reality.\nThat has real implications for things like land ownership. Residents in African Nova Scotian communities are more likely to have unclear title to land on which they may have lived for many generations. That is because in those communities, informal arrangements were more common. Financial and other obstacles made it less likely that people in those communities would retain lawyers and surveyors to research title, register deeds or wills, or to survey boundaries. People may have lived on land for generations without having title registered. No one else might claim it and it may be that no one in the community disputes their entitlement to it. But they still have no formal title.\nThe legislation under which Mr. Downey made his application was intended to provide people who live in designated areas with a simpler and less expensive way to clarify title to their property. North Preston is one of those designated areas.\nUnder the legislation a person who resides in Nova Scotia and claims to own land in one of the designated areas can make an application for a certificate of claim. That application must contain a description of the land so that it can be identified and distinguished from other land. The application must include a concise statement of the facts on which the person bases the claim for ownership, and it must name other people who have occupied the land or who have claimed ownership or an interest in the land. That application must be accompanied by an abstract of title, a statutory declaration attesting to the history of the occupation of the land and a statement showing the names of anyone who holds any form of charge on the land, like a mortgage or judgment. It could be described as an alternative to the more cumbersome, expensive and time-consuming process of the Quieting Titles Act R.S.N.S., c. 382. One of the issues here is just how much more expedited that process should be in order to achieve the purposes of the legislation.\nSection 4(4) of the Land Titles Clarification Act provides that the Minister of Lands and Forestry may require the applicant to provide any information that the Minister desires and may require the applicant to verify any material or information accompanying the application. That provides the Minister with considerable discretion in terms of the information that may be required.\nThe certificate of claim is the first step toward obtaining a certificate of title. Section 5(1) says that when it appears from the application that the “applicant is entitled to the lot of land” the Minister may issue a certificate of claim. If the Minister cannot determine whether the applicant is entitled to the land the matter is referred to a commissioner to examine the claim. That commissioner, who is a barrister appointed by the Minister, recommends issuance of a certificate or provides reasons for not making the recommendation. When the commissioner recommends issuing a certificate of claim, the Minister may issue one without making further inquiries.\nOnce a certificate of claim is issued the Minister is required to register it. The public is notified through publication in a newspaper. The certificate of claim then places an onus on those who also claim an interest in the land. Holders of liens, mortgages and judgments affecting the land, which have been in place for more than 2 years and on which no payments or written acknowledgments have been made for two years or more are required to take steps to enforce the security. Once notice has been provided, they have 3 months to enforce it. If steps are not taken the lien or charge on the property, it is deemed to no longer be binding on the land. Others, who claim an interest in the land can file a notice with the Minister within 60 days of the certificate of claim having been filed. That person then has 60 more days within which to start an action in the Supreme Court for a declaration that the interest they claim is valid. If that action has not been started the Minister will grant a certificate of title to the applicant.\nSo, the certificate of claim starts a process by which other interested parties are then required to take some action to either enforce the registered charge on the property if they have one, or make a formal claim for a declaration of an interest in the land. If no claims are made within the time limits set out in the act, the Minister is required to grant the certificate of title. The applicant then has title to the land in fee simple.\nThe issuing of a certificate of claim is then more than an acknowledgement that a claim has been made. It grants that claim status as a presumptive interest in the land which others are then required to contest.\nThe Minster “may” issue a certificate of claim, when it appears that the applicant is “entitled to the lot of land”. The Minister then has to make a determination of whether the applicant appears to be “entitled”. The legislation does not set out the grounds upon which the Minister can make that determination and does not provide any definition of entitlement. What does it mean to be “entitled” to land, within the context of this remedial legislation?\n[\u0026hellip;]\n"},{"id":93,"href":"/problems/duchman-v-oakland/","title":"Duchman v Oakland Dairy (1928), 63 OLR 111 (CA)","section":"Problems","content":"Writing over a decade after his decision in Black v Canadian Copper Co., Justice Middleton\u0026ndash;now at the Ontario Court of Appeal\u0026ndash;took a different approach to the question of remedy for nuisance in Duchman v Oakland Dairy. In Duchman, the plaintiffs brought an action against a neighbouring dairy operation in Toronto, claiming that the noise caused in the early mornings interfered with plaintiffs\u0026rsquo; and their families\u0026rsquo; sleep. The plaintiffs complained of \u0026ldquo;the constant noise resulting from the loading and unloading of the defendants\u0026rsquo; wagons and motor-trucks; the stamping and kicking of the defendants\u0026rsquo; horses; the rattling of the wagons and trucks and their contents; and the yelling of the defendant company\u0026rsquo;s servants and employees while engaged in their duties.\u0026rdquo;\nOn the evidence, the dairy had been operating more or less continuously from 1897. Having found the existence of nuisance, the trial judge awarded damages in lieu of an injunction. The plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s appealed this aspect of the decision on remedy.\nThe Ontario Court of Appeal split on their reasons for allowing the plaintiffs\u0026rsquo; appeal. In the course of his judgement finding that an injunction should be granted, Justice Middleton addressed directly the application of the Shelfer test in the Canadian context:\nThe case of Shelfer v. City of London Electric Lighting Co., [1895] 1 Ch. 287, is, I think, not only a binding authority, but one which we should unhesitatingly follow. It has never been questioned in England or here, and, if regard is paid to this decision, then the plaintiff Duchman is entitled to the injunction claimed. The injury to his legal right is not small, it is not capable of being estimated in money, and money would not be an adequate compensation, particularly money which can be described as a small money payment. A noise which during the early morning hours prevents the plaintiff from sleeping in comfort and peace is not a trivial thing. Under the judgment as it now stands this is recognised, but the plaintiff has no injunction, nor has he the damages which under Lord Cairns\u0026rsquo; Act he is entitled to in lieu of an injunction. See Arthur v. Grand Trunk Railway Co. (1895), 22 A.E. 89.\nIt has been suggested that our Courts are more free than the English Courts in substituting damages for an injunction. I do not agree with this proposition. Both in England and in this country there was a period of time in which the Courts had no settled policy as to the application of the Act in question. Each Judge did that which was right in his own eyes without recognising any guiding principle, but as the law came to be settled, the principle crystallised in the Shelfer case gradually emerged, and this has been accepted everywhere as a sound guiding principle, and I think it should not be departed from.\nCan you explain how Shelfer operated as a \u0026ldquo;sound working rule\u0026rdquo; to resolve the question of when damages ought to be awarded in lieu of an injunction? What distinguishes Duchman v Oakland Dairy from Black v Canadian Copper Co.?\n"},{"id":94,"href":"/casebook/title/duthie/","title":"Duthie v Gallagher \u0026 Duthie","section":"Chapter 3","content":" Fisher, J. - # The plaintiffs, who are beneficiaries under the will of William Duthie, deceased, complain, inter alia, of a breach of trust on the part of the defendants as executors and trustees under the will in omitting to sell the testamentary property when it might have been sold at a good price and retaining it and paying taxes thereon for a while until part of it (some eleven acres) was finally lost at a tax sale and the rest or the portion thereof unsold has become so depreciated in value that the estate, which was estimated to have had a net value of approximately, $21,000 at the time of the death of the testator in September, 1911, is now apparently at best little more than solvent. In reply the defendant Gallagher, who has been the active executor (the co-executor being now a man over 80 years of age), first calls attention to a fact which I think should be taken into consideration under the circumstances here where such a devastavit as aforesaid is alleged, viz., that since the death of the deceased, the plaintiffs, being the widow (who married again in 1912) and the children while infants, have lived rent free on the most salable part of the estate being one of the Burnaby properties consisting of about five acres and have also had certain rents from time to time therefrom. Attention has also been called to the fact admitted by the plaintiffs that the widow did not wish this part of the property sold and apparently the other plaintiffs since coming of age have all approved of the use being made of this portion of the estate though in the last paragraph of the will the testator directs that in the event of his wife marrying again his trustees should use the income for the benefit of the daughters (only).\nCounsel on behalf of the plaintiffs contends that the executors should not have considered the widow as representing the children as well as herself as no guardian was appointed under the will. Under such circumstances however the mother being the natural guardian undoubtedly assumed to act for them and later on, in August, 1917, acting as their mother and next friend she gave specific instructions in writing to Mr. Findlay, who apparently on such instructions acted as solicitor on behalf of the children as well as for the mother in dealing with the executors and under the circumstances I would acquit the latter of any blame in recognizing the mother as representing the children. According to the evidence the property (most of which was Burnaby acreage) was at its peak in value about the time of the death of the testator who was apparently imbued with what would appear to have been the general feeling of optimism at that time for the said defendant. Gallagher, who drew the will, says that at the special request of the testator, a clause was added to the 4th paragraph stating his wishes that the real estate should not be sold unless the trustees should consider it necessary, the exact words of such 4th paragraph then being as hereinafter set out.\nBefore the war some other property in the neighbourhood, better situated however, as to transportation than the property in question, was selling as high at $1,500 an acre, and higher prices were expected. During this period before the war the defendant Gallagher says that the trustees did not sell the property having in mind the wording of the will as set out below and not considering it necessary to do so. Gallagher admits, however, that he endeavoured to sell the land at $700 an acre and thought it ought to bring that. He states, however, and I accept his statement, that the widow objected to a sale at that price and thought it should bring $1,000 an acre and he did not blame her at that time in view of the optimism then prevailing. Counsel for the plaintiffs contends that the fact that the trustees during this period offered to sell at $700 an acre indicates that they considered it necessary to sell and that they should therefore be liable for a breach of trust in not selling when the only alternative was to let the taxes accumulate and borrow money to help the beneficiaries. It might perhaps be argued that as trustees the defendants should not have speculated at all on the future but in view of the express wishes of the testator and also those of his widow, I would say that there was no breach of trust at this period and one might also add that, if the prices had soared instead of falling, those who insisted on calling the omission to sell a breach of trust would undoubtedly have conceded later on that it was a most judicious breach of trust — if they had been reminded of an expression by Lindley, M.R., who is reported to have observed in Perrins v. Bellamy, [1899] 1 Ch. 797, at p. 798, that his old master the late Selwyn, L.J., used to say, “’The main duty of a trustee is to commit judicious breaches of trust.’”\nWhen the war came prices fell and the property became practically unsalable for some time. Later on in 1920 things improved and, though no such prices were obtainable as had previously prevailed, it would appear that at least some of the property might have been sold then at what the defendant trustee Gallagher calls a good price. The property was not sold and here arises what would appear to be the gravamen of the complaint and in this connection the evidence of the said trustee, as given in his examination for discovery, may be considered: —\n\u0026hellip;When we got a chance to sell the property their solicitor objected time after time. The solicitor would go so far as to say that he was acting for the widow or her children. Q. That was Mr. . . .? A. Findlay. Q. Findlay? A. Yes. If it was to shorten it up any I would tell you a little about it. My co-trustee and I in 1920 disagreed because I wanted to appeal to the Court from (?) the sale. Q. “Why didn’t you appeal to the Court? A. Well, my trustee wouldn’t join me. Q. That wouldn’t prevent you from appealing? A. Well, Mr. Russell, the solicitor at that time, said it was bad and foolish for the trustees to disagree. If we could get on at all, to do so. I certainly would have sold the property in 1920 or 1921 when we had a good offer for it, if I could have done it personally. Q. But your co-executor objected? A. They had objected, or Mrs. Stevens objected, and her solicitor objected, and then when I took it up with him he wouldn’t quarrel with them. He said the will provided that the wishes of the dead was that it wouldn’t be done as long as we could prevent it. and if the widow wouldn’t agree he wouldn’t join me — couldn’t agree. Q. Now, we will go back to the will. It speaks for itself, and you prepared it? A. I did.\nQ. There is nothing in that will that would indicate that you should obtain the consent of the beneficiaries, of the widow or anyone else, except Mr. Duthie and yourself, who were the only executors and trustees under the will, might sell the real and personal estate as soon after Mr. Duthie’s demise as you and Mr. Duthie might deem expedient. A. Just read the clause. Q. I am reading: ‘I direct my trustees to sell and convert into money such of my real and personal estate as soon after my demise as they may deem expedient and to invest the said sums of money thus arising in the names of my trustees in real estate or real estate securities, and to vary the investments from time to time if any there are of a like nature; it is my wishes that my real estate be not sold unless my trustees consider it necessary.’ Now, you thought it was necessary to sell; Mr. Duthie disagreed with you? A. Personally I thought it was necessary and advisable. Q. To sell? A. To sell in 1920, when we had a good offer. Q. But Mr. Duthie disagreed with you? A. Mr. Duthie only partly disagreed. He approved of the sale, but he disagreed with going to the Court to force the sale against the wishes of Mrs. Stevens and her solicitor. Q. That was Mr. Findlay? A. Mr. Findlay. Q. Yes? A. I did say that it would be wise, and tried to advise her to sell. Q. But it was owing to the objections of Mrs. Stevens — now Ida Stevens? A. And her solicitor. Q. And her solicitor, Mr. Findlay? A. She claimed he was acting for her and the children. Q. And that he wouldn’t allow you to sell? A. Oh, he disapproved of it. Q. Oh, he disapproved of the sale. A. Time and time again. When I advertised it for sale he disapproved of it before they were received, in writing. Q. Who? A. Mr. Findlay and the plaintiffs. Q. Well, was that disapproval in writing? A. Yes. Q. Or was it verbal? A. In writing, in writing. Q. In writing; who wrote the letters? A. Mr. Findlay. Q. Did Mrs. Stevens write any letters? A. No, not that I know of.\nThe plaintiff, Mrs. Stevens, on this point and also concerning the question of the sale of the home, says: —\nQ. Yes, I see. Do you remember in 1916 the executors had an offer to sell part of the property for $3,500 and they took the matter up with you to see what you thought of it? A. That was a home — the home, and I was there, that I didn’t like to lose the home. Q. Well, they did make a proposition to you to sell at that time and you refused to accept it? A. The home, just the home, nothing else. Q. Well, whatever it was, you refused to accept the proposition they made? A. Well, the children were not able to look after themselves and I needed a home and they needed a home. Q. Mr. Findlay was acting for you at that time? A. Yes. Q. He was acting also for your children as well as yourself? A. Yes.\nQ. Do you remember in 1920 the executors had another offer of $4,000 for the wild acreage? A. I don’t remember. Q. And you refused? A. I don’t remember that. I remember that Mr. Gallagher wrote and he said he could get $190 an acre — either $190 or $195. Q. For what? A. For part of the Bundy place. Q. Part of what? A. Well, I think he sold the Bundy place for — one part of the acreage for 300 an acre, something like that. It was $190 and I did refuse then. Q. Well, wait until we get that clear. I have it in my mind that there were two parcels, one with a five acre parcel where the home was — two houses? A. Yes. Q. The other was a 16 acre parcel that was some distance away. Now you say that Mr. Gallagher had an offer of $190 an acre for the 16 acre parcel? A. Yes, I think it was 11 acres. Q. Well, it was eleven ultimately? A. Yes. Q. Yes, but did you accept that offer? A. Well, there were no properties selling as low as that right then. Q. Well, you refused — you objected to that offer? A. I said it was pretty low. Q. Yes, and your solicitor objected to that offer, did he, Mr. Findlay? A. Well, I think he said it was rather low with what they had been paying.\nFrom the above evidence it is apparent that in 1920 the trustees considered it necessary to sell but they did not do so owing to the objections which I find were made by the plaintiffs or their solicitor on their behalf. It is stoutly contended by Mr. Johnston of counsel for the plaintiffs that the trustees at this time should have either sold or being in a fiduciary position should have applied to the Court for directions in the matter. To me it does appear that when they considered it necessary in 1920 to sell and the beneficiaries objected the trustees should have sought the advice of the Court and I would hold that there was a breach of trust at this time for which the trustees might be personally liable. Counsel for the defendants however, rely on s. 88 of the Trustee Act, R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 262, and urge that in any case the defendants should be relieved wholly from personal liability. Said section reads as follows: —\nIf it appears to the Supreme Court or a Judge thereof that a trustee, however appointed, is or may be personally liable for any breach of trust, whether the transaction alleged to be a breach of trust occurred before or after the passing of this Act, but has acted honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to be excused for the breach of trust and for omitting to obtain the directions of the Court in the matter in which he committed such breach, then the Court or Judge may relieve the trustee either wholly or partly from personal liability for the same.\nMy view is that the trustee in the embarrassing circumstances in which they were placed, when the beneficiaries refused to consent to the sale, acted honestly and reasonably and ought fairly to be excused for the breach of trust and for omitting to obtain the directions of the Court in the matter in which they committed such breach. In such a case the said section of the Trustee Act enables me to relieve the trustees either wholly or partly from personal liability for same and I relieve them from such liability, except that I will not allow them costs of the action herein against the plaintiffs personally, and direct that the defendants shall have only their party and party costs herein out of the estate if and so far as the estate is solvent.\nI might add that I have not overlooked consideration of the other grounds of complaint raised by the plaintiffs herein, but as to these I cannot see any liability on the part of the defendants.\nI note that in his will the testator directed that so soon as his youngest daughter becomes twenty-one years of age the trustees should divide his estate equally between his wife and three daughters. The youngest daughter became twenty-one years of age in 1928. It may be that there is nothing to divide, but it would seem that the estate should now be wound up and if the parties cannot agree directions might be applied for. The accounts of the defendants as executors and trustees should be passed, and in the taking of the accounts the defendants should be allowed the amounts advanced personally by them or either of them without interest, and the monies borrowed and used on behalf of the estate and secured by promissory note signed by them. Monies paid out on account of taxes should be allowed. See Re Breckenridge, [1918] 3 W.W.R. 803, at p. 808 If any further directions are necessary, the matter can be spoken to.\n"},{"id":95,"href":"/casebook/title/duty-to-consult/","title":"Duty to Consult","section":"Chapter 3","content":"You will note that in the final paragraphs excerpted from Tsilhqot\u0026rsquo;in Nation, the Supreme Court found that the Province of British Columbia breached its duty to consult with the Tsilhqot\u0026rsquo;in Nation prior to granting forestry licences to third parties on territorial lands. That duty was engaged when the Province began the planning process for removing timber on the land.\nAn important point here is that the Crown owed and breached its duty to consult with the Tsilhqot\u0026rsquo;in Nation well prior to the Tsilhqot\u0026rsquo;in Nation successfully proving their claim in the courts. This is a central purpose of the consultation doctrine: it engages the Crown\u0026rsquo;s fiduciary duty and the honour of the Crown in advance of litigation or negotiations to address claims to title, and therefore offers some measure of protection for title lands in light of the several legal and other barriers to successfully resolving such claims.\nIn Haida Nation v British Columbia (Minister of Forests), 2004 SCC 73, the Supreme Court of Canada first recognized the existance of the Crown\u0026rsquo;s constitutional duty to consult and accommodate. According to the Court in Haida Nation, \u0026ldquo;duty arises when the Crown has knowledge, real or constructive, of the potential existence of the Aboriginal right or title and contemplates conduct that might adversely affect it.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Court in Haida Nation also recognized that the scope and content of the duty to consult will vary with the circumstances. It said the following:\nAgainst this background, I turn to the kind of duties that may arise in different situations. In this respect, the concept of a spectrum may be helpful, not to suggest watertight legal compartments but rather to indicate what the honour of the Crown may require in particular circumstances. At one end of the spectrum lie cases where the claim to title is weak, the Aboriginal right limited, or the potential for infringement minor. In such cases, the only duty on the Crown may be to give notice, disclose information, and discuss any issues raised in response to the notice. “‘[C]onsultation’ in its least technical definition is talking together for mutual understanding”: T. Isaac and A. Knox, “The Crown’s Duty to Consult Aboriginal People” (2003), 41 Alta. L. Rev. 49, at p. 61.\nAt the other end of the spectrum lie cases where a strong prima facie case for the claim is established, the right and potential infringement is of high significance to the Aboriginal peoples, and the risk of non-compensable damage is high. In such cases deep consultation, aimed at finding a satisfactory interim solution, may be required. While precise requirements will vary with the circumstances, the consultation required at this stage may entail the opportunity to make submissions for consideration, formal participation in the decision-making process, and provision of written reasons to show that Aboriginal concerns were considered and to reveal the impact they had on the decision. This list is neither exhaustive, nor mandatory for every case. The government may wish to adopt dispute resolution procedures like mediation or administrative regimes with impartial decision-makers in complex or difficult cases…\nWhen the consultation process suggests amendment of Crown policy, we arrive at the stage of accommodation. Thus the effect of good faith consultation may be to reveal a duty to accommodate. Where a strong prima facie case exists for the claim, and the consequences of the government’s proposed decision may adversely affect it in a significant way, addressing the Aboriginal concerns may require taking steps to avoid irreparable harm or to minimize the effects of infringement, pending final resolution of the underlying claim.\n"},{"id":96,"href":"/casebook/relationships/interpretation-1752-treaty/","title":"Early Interpretation of the 1752 Treaty","section":"Chapter 1","content":"In 1928, Grand Chief Gabriel Syliboy was charged and ultimately convicted of hunting muskrats out of season on Unamaki (Cape Breton).

The following quotes from the press release issued by Elsipogtog in advance of that filing:\nOn November 9, 2016 Elsipogtog First Nation is filing a claim on behalf of the Mi’kmaq Nation for Aboriginal title to the Mi’kma’ki district of Sikniktuk in New Brunswick.\n“This claim is about protecting our lands and waters for our children and our future generations,” said Elsipogtog Chief Arren Sock. “We cannot stand by while the government ignores us and makes decisions that threaten the traditional lands of the Mi’kmaq people. It’s time for us to exercise our rights and responsibilities to protect our territory.”\nThe Mi’kmaq, including Elsipogtog’s ancestors, signed treaties of peace and friendship with the British Crown in the 1760s. The treaties did not include the surrender of Mi’kmaq title to their lands. In the claim Elsipogtog asks the Court to confirm that the Mi’kmaq Nation continues to hold Aboriginal title and rights in Sikniktuk, and to order injunctions preventing the further destruction of the land, water, air and forest.\n“We want to offer hope and strength to our youth by taking a stand to protect Mi’kmaq title and rights,” said Kenneth Francis, speaker for Kopit Lodge, which represents Elsipogtog on resource development matters. “The federal government has promised a renewed relationship with Indigenous peoples based on partnership and respect and which is consistent with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Unfortunately, we still see Canada and the Province disregarding our rights and making decisions that threaten the health of our people and our lands. By filing this claim we are asking both levels of government to step up and take our rights seriously.”\nThe claim comes at a time when both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in New Brunswick have repeatedly raised concerns about government decisions pertaining to the lands and waters in Mi’kmaq territory.\n“Elsipogtog intends to continue to work with our Indigenous neighbours and our Canadian allies to ensure the protection of the lands and waters that sustain us,” said Chief Sock. “As part of the Mi’kmaq Nation we have a responsibility to act as stewards of our territory. Reasserting our right to make decisions about our lands and waters is an essential part of safeguarding Sikniktuk for all of our long-term benefit.”\nPlease read the following special report about the claim by Elsipogtog First Nation, written by Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw journalist Oscar Baker III.

Nuisance, in other words, is one means to exclude others from doing something that limits owners\u0026rsquo; freedom related to property. This means of exclusion, however, unavoidably limits the freedom of others to use their land as they choose. In these cases, the courts must choose not only whose rights should win out but also find some way to address the fundamental dilemma of conflicting freedoms inherent in legal liberalism.\nIn other cases it is not a neighbouring landowner who is accused of infringing the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s property rights, but the state itself. This type of claim engages the state\u0026rsquo;s power of expropriation (power to take away property rights)—in some contexts, called the power of eminent domain.\nIn the most dramatic cases, the state exercises its expropriation power to take private title to land (for example, to build a highway or an airport). But there are many other cases in which the state leaves title in the hands of the landowner but \u0026ldquo;takes\u0026rdquo; one or more sticks in the ownership bundle by way of regulation or other legislative act. In their broadest sense, such \u0026ldquo;regulatory takings\u0026rdquo; (as they are now called) are ubiquitous, ranging from environmental regulations to building codes and zoning bylaws. Similar to claims in nuisance, these state actions have sometimes been cast as violations of claimant landowners\u0026rsquo; traditional rights of property.\nA key legal issue is to what extent landowners in Canada can exclude governments from expropriating or otherwise regulating their property rights in the absence of compensation. Unlike the United States and several modern constitutional democracies, Canada lacks any constitutional protections for private property against state attempts to limit or take away those rights. Lacking such explicit protections, it has generally not been possible for claimants to invoke existing constitutional rights in ways that protect private property.\nWhat protections do exist mainly take the form of provincial expropriation statutes. These statutes do not prevent government from expropriating property altogether, but they do impose certain restrictions on this activity, such as that it must be undertaken for a public purpose and that adequate compensation to landowners must be paid. Such compensation is clearly required when title is taken away by the state. Much less clear is to what extent governments in Canada are responsible for compensating landowners for regulatory activity that \u0026ldquo;takes\u0026rdquo; one or more sticks in the bundle. As the United States Supreme Court observed in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v Mahon, \u0026ldquo;[g]overnment hardly could go on if, to some extent, values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law.\u0026rdquo;\n"},{"id":99,"href":"/casebook/governance/expropriation-act/","title":"Expropriation Act","section":"Chapter 2","content":" 3(1)(c) “expropriate” means the taking of land without the consent of the owner by an expropriating authority in the exercise of its statutory powers;\n[\u0026hellip;]\n24 Where land is expropriated, the statutory authority shall pay the owner compensation as is determined in accordance with this Act.\n"},{"id":100,"href":"/casebook/other/first-possession/","title":"First Possession and Wild Animals","section":"Chapter 6","content":" Classical First Possession: Locke and Wild Animals # Locke\u0026rsquo;s argument for possession (by means of one\u0026rsquo;s labour) as the basis for establishing property rights in \u0026ldquo;unowned\u0026rdquo; things and land has had a lasting influence on common law property. More important still, the way in which Locke justified his principle of first possession laid much of the groundwork for the style of classical legal thought that would come to dominate in the nineteenth century.\nOne historical setting in which Locke\u0026rsquo;s principle of first possession became increasingly significant was Newfoundland\u0026rsquo;s seal fishery. By the nineteenth century, this industry had grown in economic importance and scale. Larger boats departing from southern areas of the island began to sail further afield in the sea ice during the hunting season. As in Clift v Kane, it was not uncommon for sealers to kill large numbers of seals on the open ice flows only to lose access to the pelts before they could haul them aboard, as their ships were cut off by changing ice patterns due to weather, ocean currents or other causes. Sometimes, another crew of sealers would come upon the pelts and recover them. In a subsequent contest between conflicting claims to the pelts, the courts were called upon to answer the question of which party had first come into legal possession. That question tested Locke\u0026rsquo;s seemingly straightforward application of his principle to someone who picks up an acorn off the ground and comes to possess it simply by virtue of time and effort spent.\nIn Clift v Kane, we encounter our first case study examining how judicial decisions about common law property rules created the foundations for Canada\u0026rsquo;s liberal market economy. In the context of Newfoundland\u0026rsquo;s nineteenth-century sealing economy, these rules established the terms of competition between sealers and determined the preconditions for bringing their \u0026ldquo;products\u0026rdquo; to market. While both judges in the case emphasize the importance of a freely competitive marketplace for Newfoundland\u0026rsquo;s seal fishery, it seems quite clear that we cannot simply take that marketplace as a given. In fact, its fundamental rules are in the process of being determined by the very case before the court.\nAs you read Clift v Kane, start by trying to identify and describe the two different rules of first possession being advanced by Chief Justice Hoyles (writing for the majority) and Justice Robinson (in dissent).\nPossession in Wild Animals and Darwin, the IKEA Monkey # You might remember Darwin, also known as the IKEA monkey, who went viral in 2012 for roaming around IKEA in a stylish coat. What you might not know is that Darwin was also the centre of a legal dispute—a legal dispute which involved some of the same principles of possession present in Clift v Kane.\nThe background to the legal dispute began when Yasmin Nakhuda purchased Darwin illegally from an exotic pet dealer. Nakhuda had been keeping the monkey as a pet for a few months when she brought him to IKEA, leaving him in a locked cage in her car while she shopped. However, Darwin escaped and wandered into the store, where he was captured by Toronto Animal Services and eventually brought to a primate sanctuary. Nakhuda sued the sanctuary to try and get Darwin back.\nOne key issue in the legal case was whether or not Nakhuda lost ownership of Darwin when he escaped. To determine the answer, the court relied on a 1917 case called Campbell v Hedley. In that case, a fox had escaped from a fox breeder and was shot by the defendant. The court held that domestic animals “are the subject of absolute property, and the owner retains his right of property if they stray away.\u0026quot; 1 However, in the case of wild animals—like the fox—an owner only has qualified possession unless the animal is under their complete physical control, for example if the animal is dead. In this case, the fox breeder lost his qualified possession when the fox escaped and became the defendant’s absolute possession after it was killed.\nThe court in Nakhuda’s case came to a similar conclusion, finding that the sanctuary was the owner of the monkey: “when the monkey ran away and Ms. Nakhuda lost possession of him, she lost ownership of him. Accordingly, she has no right to have him returned to her.” 2\nFirst Possession Revisited # Popov v Hayashi, below, received considerable media and popular attention when the events giving rise to the case unfolded in October 2001. In part, this was because the facts seemed so unusual, even extraordinary. The basic legal problem at the heart of the case, however, was nothing new. To get a sense of that problem and the actual circumstances surrounding the legal issue, watch the following recorded video of the events on October 7 at PacBell Park in San Francisco.\nWatch Barry Bonds\u0026rsquo; 73rd Home Run # \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; The starting point for characterizing the central legal issue in Popov is to recognize that, at the moment when the record-setting baseball made contact with Barry Bonds\u0026rsquo; bat we can assume—as the parties in the case agreed to do—that it was effectively abandoned property. This placed the baseball into the legal category of \u0026ldquo;unowned things\u0026rdquo;—not too dissimilar from the seals discussed in Clift v Kane. Being abandoned, the baseball was—as it sailed in the air toward the stands full of eager fans—unburdened from any prior proprietary entitlements and therefore free to be claimed by the first possessor.\nNext, read Justice McCarthy\u0026rsquo;s decision in Popov v Hayashi below. Pay close attention to both the result in the case and the judge\u0026rsquo;s justifications for reaching that result. Does Justice McCarthy\u0026rsquo;s decision typify the classical style, the modern style, some combination of these, or something else altogether?\nCampbell v Hedley, [1917] O.J.

In 1957, members of the Musqueam Indian Band voted to surrender 162 acres of their reserve lands to the federal Crown on the understanding that these lands would in turn be leased by the Crown to the Shaughnessy Heights Golf Club for use as a golf course. Rents and other benefits from this lease were to be paid to Band. The final terms on which the Crown ultimately leased the lands to Shaughnessy Heights, however, were very unfavourable to the Band. The Chief and Councillors of the Musqueam Indian Band sued the Crown for breach of trust and damages in the amount of $10,000,000.]\nDickson J. — # The question is whether the appellants, the Chief and Councillors of the Musqueam Indian Band, suing on their own behalf and on behalf of all other members of the band, are entitled to recover damages from the federal Crown in respect of the leasing to a golf club of land on the Musqueam Indian Reserve. Collier J., of the Trial Division of the Federal Court, declared that the Crown was in breach of trust. He assessed damages at $10,000,000. The Federal Court of Appeal allowed a Crown appeal, set aside the judgment of the Trial Division and dismissed the action.\nI. General # Before adverting to the facts, reference should be made to several of the relevant sections of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952 c.149 as amended. Section 18(1) provides in part that reserves shall be held by Her Majesty for the use of the respective Indian bands for which they were set apart. Generally, lands in a reserve shall not be sold, alienated, leased or otherwise disposed of until they have been surrendered to Her Majesty by the band for whose use and benefit in common the reserve was set apart (s.37). A surrender may be absolute or qualified, conditional or unconditional (s.38(2)). To be valid, a surrender must be made to Her Majesty, assented to by a majority of the electors of the band, and accepted by the Governor in Council (s.39(1)).\nThe gist of the present action is a claim that the federal Crown was in breach of its trust obligations in respect of the leasing of approximately 162 acres of reserve land to the Shaughnessy Heights Golf Club of Vancouver. The band alleged that a number of the terms and conditions of the lease were different from those disclosed to them before the surrender vote and that some of the lease terms were not disclosed to them at all. The band also claimed failure on the part of the federal Crown to exercise the requisite degree of care and management as a trustee.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIV. Fiduciary Relationship # The issue of the Crown’s liability was dealt with in the courts below on the basis of the existence or non-existence of a trust. In dealing with the different consequences of a “true” trust, as opposed to a “political” trust, Le Dain J. noted that the Crown could be liable only if it were subject to an “equitable obligation enforceable in a court of law”. I have some doubt as to the cogency of the terminology of “higher” and “lower” trusts, but I do agree that the existence of an equitable obligation is the sine qua non for liability. Such an obligation is not, however, limited to relationships which can be strictly defined as “trusts”. As will presently appear, it is my view that the Crown’s obligations vis-à-vis the Indians cannot be defined as a trust. That does not, however, mean that the Crown owes no enforceable duty to the Indians in the way in which it deals with Indian land.\nIn my view, the nature of Indian title and the framework of the statutory scheme established for disposing of Indian land places upon the Crown an equitable obligation, enforceable by the courts, to deal with the land for the benefit of the Indians. This obligation does not amount to a trust in the private law sense. It is rather a fiduciary duty. If, however, the Crown breaches this fiduciary duty it will be liable to the Indians in the same way and to the same extent as if such a trust were in effect.\nThe fiduciary relationship between the Crown and the Indians has its roots in the concept of aboriginal, native or Indian title. The fact that Indian bands have a certain interest in lands does not, however, in itself give rise to a fiduciary relationship between the Indians and the Crown. The conclusion that the Crown is a fiduciary depends upon the further proposition that the Indian interest in the land is inalienable except upon surrender to the Crown.\nAn Indian band is prohibited from directly transferring its interest to a third party. Any sale or lease of land can only be carried out after a surrender has taken place, with the Crown then acting on the band’s behalf. The Crown first took this responsibility upon itself in the Royal Proclamation of 1763. It is still recognized in the surrender provisions of the Indian Act. The surrender requirement, and the responsibility it entails, are the source of a distinct fiduciary obligation owed by the Crown to the Indians. In order to explore the character of this obligation, however, it is first necessary to consider the basis of aboriginal title and the nature of the interest in land which it represents.\n(a) The Existence of Indian Title # In Calder v. Attorney General of British Columbia, [1973] S.C.R. 313, this Court recognized aboriginal title as a legal right derived from the Indians’ historic occupation and possession of their tribal lands. With Judson and Hall JJ. writing the principal judgments, the Court split three-three on the major issue of whether the Nishga Indians’ aboriginal title to their ancient tribal territory had been extinguished by general land enactments in British Columbia. The Court also split on the issue of whether the Royal Proclamation of 1763 was applicable to Indian lands in that Province. Judson and Hall JJ. were in agreement, however, that aboriginal title existed in Canada (at least where it had not been extinguished by appropriate legislative action) independently of the Royal Proclamation. Judson J. stated expressly that the Proclamation was not the “exclusive” source of Indian title (pp.322-23, 328). Hall J. said (at p.390) that “aboriginal Indian title does not depend on treaty, executive order or legislative enactment”.\nThe Royal Proclamation of 1763 reserved “under our Sovereignty, Protection, and Dominion, for the use of the said Indians, all the Lands and Territories not included within the Limits of Our said Three new Governments, or within the Limits of the Territory granted to the Hudson’s Bay Company, as also all the Lands and Territories lying to the Westward of the Sources of the Rivers which fall into the Sea from the West and North West as aforesaid” (R.S.C. 1970, Appendices 123, at p.127). In recognizing that the Proclamation is not the sole source of Indian title the Calder decision went beyond the judgment of the Privy Council in St. Catherine’s Milling and Lumber Co. v. The Queen (1888), 14 App. Cas. 46.In that case Lord Watson acknowledged the existence of aboriginal title but said it had its origin in the Royal Proclamation. In this respect Calder is consistent with the position of Chief Justice Marshall in the leading American cases of Johnson v. McIntosh (1823), 8 Wheaton 543, and Worcester v. State of Georgia (1832), 6 Peters 515 , cited by Judson and Hall JJ. in their respective judgments.\nIn Johnson v. McIntosh Marshall C.J., although he acknowledged the Proclamation of 1763 as one basis for recognition of Indian title, was nonetheless of opinion that the rights of Indians in the lands they traditionally occupied prior to European colonization both predated and survived the claims to sovereignty made by various European nations in the territories of the North American continent. The principle of discovery which justified these claims gave the ultimate title in the land in a particular area to the nation which had discovered and claimed it. In that respect at least the Indians’ rights in the land were obviously diminished; but their rights of occupancy and possession remained unaffected. Marshall C.J. explained this principle as follows, at pp.573-74:\nThe exclusion of all other Europeans, necessarily gave to the nation making the discovery the sole right of acquiring the soil from the natives, and establishing settlements upon it. It was a right which all asserted for themselves, and to the assertion of which, by others, all assented.\nThose relations which were to exist between the discoverer and the natives, were to be regulated by themselves. The rights thus acquired being exclusive, no other power could interpose between them.\nIn the establishment of these relations, the rights of the original inhabitants were, in no instance, entirely disregarded; but were necessarily, to a considerable extent, impaired. They were admitted to be the rightful occupants of the soil, with a legal as well as just claim to retain possession of it, and to use it according to their own discretion; but their rights to complete sovereignty, as independent nations, were necessarily diminished, and their power to dispose of the soil at their own will, to whomsoever they pleased, was denied by the original fundamental principle, that discovery gave exclusive title to those who made it. (emphasis added)\nThe principle that a change in sovereignty over a particular territory does not in general affect the presumptive title of the inhabitants was approved by the Privy Council in Amodu Tijani v. Secretary of State, Nigeria, [1921] 2 A.C. 399. That principle supports the assumption implicit in Calder that Indian title is an independent legal right which, although recognized by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, nonetheless predates it. For this reason Kinloch v. Secretary of State for India,supra; Tito v. Waddell, supra, and the other “political trust” decisions are inapplicable to the present case. The “political trust” cases concerned essentially the distribution of public funds or other property held by the government. In each case the party claiming to be beneficiary under a trust depended entirely on statute, ordinance or treaty as the basis for its claim to an interest in the funds in question. The situation of the Indians is entirely different. Their interest in their lands is a pre-existing legal right not created by Royal Proclamation, by s.18(1) of the Indian Act, or by any other executive order or legislative provision.\nIt does not matter, in my opinion, that the present case is concerned with the interest of an Indian band in a reserve rather than with unrecognized aboriginal title in traditional tribal lands. The Indian interest in the land is the same in both cases: see Attorney General of Quebec v. Attorney General of Canada, [1921] 1 A.C. 401 at pp.410-11(the Star Chrome case). It is worth noting, however, that the reserve in question here was created out of the ancient tribal territory of the Musqueam band by the unilateral action of the Colony of British Columbia, prior to Confederation.\n(b) The Nature of Indian Title # In the St. Catherine’s Milling case, supra, the Privy Council held that the Indians had a “personal and usufructuary right” in the lands which they had traditionally occupied. Lord Watson said that “there has been all along vested in the Crown a substantial and paramount estate, underlying the Indian title, which became a plenum dominium whenever the title was surrendered or otherwise extinguished” (at p.55). He reiterated this idea, stating that the Crown “has all along had a present proprietary estate in the land, upon which the Indian title was a mere burden” (at p.58). This view of aboriginal title was affirmed by the Privy Council in the Star Chrome case. In Amodu Tijani, supra, Viscount Haldane, adverting to the St. Catherine’s Milling and Star Chrome decisions, explained the concept of a usufructuary right as “a mere qualification of or burden on the radical or final title of the Sovereign\u0026hellip;” (p.403). He described the title of the Sovereign as a pure legal estate, but one which could be qualified by a right of “beneficial user” that did not necessarily take the form of an estate in land. Indian title in Canada was said to be one illustration “of the necessity for getting rid of the assumption that the ownership of land naturally breaks itself up into estates, conceived as creatures of inherent legal principle.” Chief Justice Marshall took a similar view in Johnson v. McIntosh, supra, saying, “All our institutions recognize the absolute title of the Crown, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy\u0026hellip;” (p.588).\nIt should be noted that the Privy Council’s emphasis on the personal nature of aboriginal title stemmed in part from constitutional arrangements peculiar to Canada. The Indian territory at issue in St. Catherine’s Milling was land which in 1867 had been vested in the Crown subject to the interest of the Indians. The Indians’ interest was “an interest other than that of the Province”, within the meaning of s.109 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Section 109 provides:\nAll Lands, Mines, Minerals, and Royalties belonging to the several Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick at the Union, and all Sums then due or payable for such Lands, Mines, Minerals, or Royalties, shall belong to the several Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick in which the same are situate or arise subject to any Trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any Interest other than that of the Province in the same.\nWhen the land in question in St. Catherine’s Milling was subsequently disencumbered of the native title upon its surrender to the federal government by the Indian occupants in 1873, the entire beneficial interest in the land was held to have passed, because of the personal and usufructuary nature of the Indians’ right, to the Province of Ontario under s.109 rather than to Canada. The same constitutional issue arose recently in this Court in Government of Canada v. Smith (1983), 47 N.R. 132, in which the Court held that the Indian right in a reserve, being personal, could not be transferred to a grantee, whether an individual or the Crown. Upon surrender the right disappeared “in the process of release”.\nNo such constitutional problem arises in the present case, since in 1938 the title to all Indian reserves in British Columbia was transferred by the provincial government to the Crown in right of Canada.\nIt is true that in contexts other than the constitutional the characterization of Indian title as “a personal and usufructuary right” has sometimes been questioned. In Calder, supra, for example, Judson J. intimated at p.328 that this characterization was not helpful in determining the nature of Indian title. In Attorney General of Canada v. Giroux (1916), 53 S.C.R. 172, Duff J., speaking for himself and Anglin J., distinguished St. Catherine’s Milling on the ground that the statutory provisions in accordance with which the reserve in question in Giroux had been created conferred beneficial ownership on the Indian band which occupied the reserve. In Cardinal v. Attorney General of Alberta, [1974] S.C.R. 695, Laskin J., dissenting on another point, accepted the possibility that Indians may have a beneficial interest in a reserve. The Alberta Court of Appeal in Western International Contractors Ltd. v. Sarcee Developments Ltd., [1979] 3 W.W.R. 630, accepted the proposition that an Indian Band does indeed have a beneficial interest in its reserve. In the present case this was the view as well of Le Dain J. in the Federal Court of Appeal. See also the judgment of Kellock J. in Miller v. The King, [1950] S.C.R. 168, in which he seems implicitly to adopt a similar position. None of these judgments mentioned the Star Chrome case, however, in which the Indian interest in land specifically set aside as a reserve was held to be the same as the “personal and usufructuary right” which was discussed in St. Catherine’s Milling.\nIt appears to me that there is no real conflict between the cases which characterize Indian title as a beneficial interest of some sort, and those which characterize it a personal, usufructuary right. Any apparent inconsistency derives from the fact that in describing what constitutes a unique interest in land the courts have almost inevitably found themselves applying a somewhat inappropriate terminology drawn from general property law. There is a core of truth in the way that each of the two lines of authority has described native title, but an appearance of conflict has nonetheless arisen because in neither case is the categorization quite accurate.\nIndians have a legal right to occupy and possess certain lands, the ultimate title to which is in the Crown. While their interest does not, strictly speaking, amount to beneficial ownership, neither is its nature completely exhausted by the concept of a personal right. It is true that the sui generis interest which the Indians have in the land is personal in the sense that it cannot be transferred to a grantee, but it is also true, as will presently appear, that the interest gives rise upon surrender to a distinctive fiduciary obligation on the part of the Crown to deal with the land for the benefit of the surrendering Indians. These two aspects of Indian title go together, since the Crown’s original purpose in declaring the Indians’ interest to be inalienable otherwise than to the Crown was to facilitate the Crown’s ability to represent the Indians in dealings with third parties. The nature of the Indians’ interest is therefore best characterized by its general inalienability, coupled with the fact that the Crown is under an obligation to deal with the land on the Indians’ behalf when the interest is surrendered. Any description of Indian title which goes beyond these two features is both unnecessary and potentially misleading.\n(c) The Crown’s Fiduciary Obligation # The concept of fiduciary obligation originated long ago in the notion of breach of confidence, one of the original heads of jurisdiction in Chancery. In the present appeal its relevance is based on the requirement of a “surrender” before Indian land can be alienated.\nThe Royal Proclamation of 1763 provided that no private person could purchase from the Indians any lands that the Proclamation had reserved to them, and provided further that all purchases had to be by and in the name of the Crown, in a public assembly of the Indians held by the governor or commander-in-chief of the colony in which the lands in question lay. As Lord Watson pointed out in St. Catherine’s Milling, supra, at p.54, this policy with respect to the sale or transfer of the Indians’ interest in land has been continuously maintained by the British Crown, by the governments of the colonies when they became responsible for the administration of Indian affairs, and, after 1867, by the federal government of Canada. Successive federal statutes, predecessors to the present Indian Act, have all provided for the general inalienability of Indian reserve land except upon surrender to the Crown, the relevant provisions in the present Act being ss.37-41.\nThe purpose of this surrender requirement is clearly to interpose the Crown between the Indians and prospective purchasers or lessees of their land, so as to prevent the Indians from being exploited. This is made clear in the Royal Proclamation itself, which prefaces the provision making the Crown an intermediary with a declaration that “great Frauds and Abuses have been committed in purchasing Lands of the Indians, to the great Prejudice of our Interests, and to the great Dissatisfaction of the said Indians\u0026hellip;”. Through the confirmation in the Indian Act of the historic responsibility which the Crown has undertaken, to act on behalf of the Indians so as to protect their interests in transactions with third parties, Parliament has conferred upon the Crown a discretion to decide for itself where the Indians’ best interests really lie. This is the effect of s.18(1) of the Act.\nThis discretion on the part of the Crown, far from ousting, as the Crown contends, the jurisdiction of the courts to regulate the relationship between the Crown and the Indians, has the effect of transforming the Crown’s obligation into a fiduciary one. Professor Ernest Weinrib maintains in his article “The Fiduciary Obligation” (1975), 25 U.T.L.J. 1 at p.7, that “the hallmark of a fiduciary relation is that the relative legal positions are such that one party is at the mercy of the other’s discretion.” Earlier, at p.4, he puts the point in the following way:\n[Where there is a fiduciary obligation] there is a relation in which the principal’s interests can be affected by, and are therefore dependent on, the manner in which the fiduciary uses the discretion which has been delegated to him. The fiduciary obligation is the law’s blunt tool for the control of this discretion.\nI make no comment upon whether this description is broad enough to embrace all fiduciary obligations. I do agree, however, that where by statute, agreement, or perhaps by unilateral undertaking, one party has an obligation to act for the benefit of another, and that obligation carries with it a discretionary power, the party thus empowered becomes a fiduciary. Equity will then supervise the relationship by holding him to the fiduciary’s strict standard of conduct.\nIt is sometimes said that the nature of fiduciary relationships is both established and exhausted by the standard categories of agent, trustee, partner, director, and the like. I do not agree. It is the nature of the relationship, not the specific category of actor involved that gives rise to the fiduciary duty. The categories of fiduciary, like those of negligence, should not be considered closed. See, e.g. Laskin v. Bache \u0026amp; Co. Inc. (1972), 23 D.L.R. (3d) 385 (Ont.C.A.) at p.392: Goldex Mines Ltd. v. Revill (1974), 7 O.R. 216 (Ont.C.A.) at p.224.\nIt should be noted that fiduciary duties generally arise only with regard to obligations originating in a private law context. Public law duties, the performance of which requires the exercise of discretion, do not typically give rise to a fiduciary relationship. As the “political trust” cases indicate, the Crown is not normally viewed as a fiduciary in the exercise of its legislative or administrative function. The mere fact, however, that it is the Crown which is obligated to act on the Indians’ behalf does not of itself remove the Crown’s obligation from the scope of the fiduciary principle. As was pointed out earlier, the Indians’ interest in land is an independent legal interest. It is not a creation of either the legislative or executive branches of government. The Crown’s obligation to the Indians with respect to that interest is therefore not a public law duty. While it is not a private law duty in the strict sense either, it is nonetheless in the nature of a private law duty. Therefore, in this sui generis relationship, it is not improper to regard the Crown as a fiduciary.\nSection 18(1) of the Indian Act confers upon the Crown a broad discretion in dealing with surrendered land. In the present case, the document of surrender, set out in part earlier in these reasons, by which the Musqueam band surrendered the land at issue, confirms this discretion in the clause conveying the land to the Crown “in trust to lease \u0026hellip; upon such terms as the Government of Canada may deem most conducive to our Welfare and that of our people”. When, as here, an Indian band surrenders its interest to the Crown, a fiduciary obligation takes hold to regulate the manner in which the Crown exercises its discretion in dealing with the land on the Indians’ behalf.\nI agree with Le Dain J. that before surrender the Crown does not hold the land in trust for the Indians. I also agree that the Crown’s obligation does not somehow crystallize into a trust, express or implied, at the time of surrender. The law of trusts is a highly developed, specialized branch of the law. An express trust requires a settlor, a beneficiary, a trust corpus, words of settlement, certainty of object and certainty of obligation. Not all of these elements are present here. Indeed, there is not even a trust corpus. As the Smith decision, supra, makes clear, upon unconditional surrender the Indians’ right in the land disappears. No property interest is transferred which could constitute the trust res , so that even if the other indicia of an express or implied trust could be made out, the basic requirement of a settlement of property has not been met. Accordingly, although the nature of Indian title coupled with the discretion vested in the Crown are sufficient to give rise to a fiduciary obligation, neither an express nor an implied trust arises upon surrender.\nNor does surrender give rise to a constructive trust. As was said by this Court in Pettkus v. Becker, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 834 at p.847, “The principle of unjust enrichment lies at the heart of the constructive trust”. See also Rathwell v. Rathwell, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 436. Any similarity between a constructive trust and the Crown’s fiduciary obligation to the Indians is limited to the fact that both arise by operation of law; the former is an essentially restitutionary remedy, while the latter is not. In the present case, for example, the Crown has in no way been enriched by the surrender transaction, whether unjustly or otherwise, but the fact that this is so cannot alter either the existence or the nature of the obligation which the Crown owes.\nThe Crown’s fiduciary obligation to the Indians is therefore not a trust. To say as much is not to deny that the obligation is trust-like in character. As would be the case with a trust, the Crown must hold surrendered land for the use and benefit of the surrendering band. The obligation is thus subject to principles very similar to those which govern the law of trusts concerning, for example, the measure of damages for breach. The fiduciary relationship between the Crown and the Indians also bears a certain resemblance to agency, since the obligation can be characterized as a duty to act on behalf of the Indian bands who have surrendered lands, by negotiating for the sale or lease of the land to third parties. But just as the Crown is not a trustee for the Indians, neither is it their agent; not only does the Crown’s authority to act on the band’s behalf lack a basis in contract, but the band is not a party to the ultimate sale or lease, as it would be if it were the Crown’s principal. I repeat, the fiduciary obligation which is owed to the Indians by the Crown is sui generis. Given the unique character both of the Indians’ interest in land and of their historical relationship with the Crown, the fact that this is so should occasion no surprise.\nThe discretion which is the hallmark of any fiduciary relationship is capable of being considerably narrowed in a particular case. This is as true of the Crown’s discretion vis-à-vis the Indians as it is of the discretion of trustees, agents, and other traditional categories of fiduciary. The Indian Act makes specific provision for such narrowing in ss.18(1) and 38(2). A fiduciary obligation will not, of course, be eliminated by the imposition of conditions that have the effect of restricting the fiduciary’s discretion. A failure to adhere to the imposed conditions will simply itself be a prima facie breach of the obligation. In the present case both the surrender and the Order-in-Council accepting the surrender referred to the Crown leasing the land on the band’s behalf. Prior to the surrender the band had also been given to understand that a lease was to be entered into with the Shaughnessy Heights Golf Club upon certain terms, but this understanding was not incorporated into the surrender document itself. The effect of these so-called oral terms will be considered in the next section.\n(d) Breach of the Fiduciary Obligation # The trial judge found that the Crown’s agents promised the band to lease the land in question on certain specified terms and then, after surrender, obtained lease on different terms. The lease obtained was much less valuable. As already mentioned, the surrender document did not make reference to the “oral” terms. I would not wish to say that those terms had nonetheless somehow been incorporated as conditions into the surrender. They were not formally assented to by a majority of the electors of the band, nor were they accepted by the Governor in Council, as required by s.39(1)(b) and s.39(1)(c). I agree with Le Dain J. that there is no merit in the appellants’ submission that for purposes of s.39 a surrender can be considered independently of its terms. This makes no more sense than would a claim that a contract can have an existence which in no way depends on the terms and conditions that comprise it.\nNonetheless, the Crown, in my view, was not empowered by the surrender document to ignore the oral terms which the band understood would be embodied in the lease. The oral representations form the backdrop against which the Crown’s conduct in discharging its fiduciary obligation must be measured. They inform and confine the field of discretion within which the Crown was free to act. After the Crown’s agents had induced the band to surrender its land on the understanding that the land would be leased on certain terms, it would be unconscionable to permit the Crown simply to ignore those terms. When the promised lease proved impossible to obtain, the Crown, instead of proceeding to lease the land on different, unfavourable terms, should have returned to the band to explain what had occurred and seek the band’s counsel on how to proceed. The existence of such unconscionability is the key to a conclusion that the Crown breached its fiduciary duty. Equity will not countenance unconscionable behaviour in a fiduciary, whose duty is that of utmost loyalty to his principal.\nWhile the existence of the fiduciary obligation which the Crown owes to the Indians is dependent on the nature of the surrender process, the standard of conduct which the obligation imports is both more general and more exacting than the terms of any particular surrender. In the present case the relevant aspect of the required standard of conduct is defined by a principle analogous to that which underlies the doctrine of promissory or equitable estoppel. The Crown cannot promise the band that it will obtain a lease of the latter’s land on certain stated terms, thereby inducing the band to alter its legal position by surrendering the land, and then simply ignore that promise to the bands detriment. See, e.g. Central London Property Trust Ltd. v. High Trees House Ltd., [1947] 1 K.B. 130 ; Robertson v. Minister of Pensions, [1949] 1 K.B. 227 (C.A.) .\nIn obtaining without consultation a much less valuable lease than that promised, the Crown breached the fiduciary obligation it owed the band. It must make good the loss suffered in consequence.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAppeal allowed.\n"},{"id":103,"href":"/casebook/governance/harrison/","title":"Harrison v Carswell","section":"Chapter 2","content":" Dickson J. — # The respondent, Sophie Carswell, was charged under The Petty Trespasses Act, R.S.M. 1970, c. P50, with four offences (one on each of four days) of unlawfully trespassing upon the premises of the Fairview Corporation Limited, trading under the firm name and style of Polo Park Shopping Centre, located in the City of Winnipeg, after having been requested by the owner not to enter on or come upon the premises. The appellant, Peter Harrison, manager of Polo Park Shopping Centre, swore the informations. The charges were dismissed by the Provincial Judge but on a trial de novo in the County Court Mrs. Carswell was convicted and fined $10 on each of the charges. The convictions were set aside by the Manitoba Court of Appeal [1974] 4 W.W.R. 394 (Freedman C.J.M. and Matas J.A., with Guy J.A. dissenting) and the present appeal followed by leave of this Court.\nWith great respect, I am unable to agree with the majority reasons, delivered in the Court of Appeal by Freedman C.J.M., for I find it difficult, indeed impossible, to make any well-founded distinction between this case and Peters v. The Queen (1971), 2 C.C.C. (2d) 339n, 17 D.L.R. (3d) 128, decided by this Court four years ago in a unanimous decision of the full bench. The constitutional issue raised in Peters no longer concerns us; the only other issue was whether the owner of a shopping plaza had sufficient control or possession of the common areas, having regard to the unrestricted invitation to the public to enter upon the premises, as to enable it to invoke the remedy of trespass. The Court decided it did. That case and the present case came to us on much the same facts; picketing within a shopping centre in connection with a labour dispute. In Peters the picketing was carried out by the president of the Brampton Labour Council and seven other persons, carrying placards and distributing leaflets in front of a Safeway store, seeking a boycott of Safeway for selling California grapes. In the present case the picketing was carried out by Mrs. Carswell and 11 other persons carrying placards and distributing leaflets in front of the premises of their employer, Dominion Stores. In both instances the picketing was peaceful. Although the question posed in Peters did not recite the facts upon which the case rested, the question was worded thus:\nDid the learned Judges in Appeal err in law in determining that the owner of the property had sufficient possession of the shopping plaza sidewalk to be capable of availing itself of the remedy for trespass under The Petty Trespass Act, R.S.O. 1960, Chapter 294, Section 1(1)? (The italics are mine.)\nIn my view it is so expressed, with repeated use of the definite article, as to relate the question to the circumstances in respect of which the Judges made their determination.\nThe judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Peters, [1971] 1 O.R. 597, 2 C.C.C. (2d) 336, 16 D.L.R. (3d) 143:\nWith respect to the first ground of appeal, it is our opinion that an owner who has granted a right of entry to a particular class of the public has not thereby relinquished his or its right to withdraw its invitation to the general public or any particular member thereof, and that if a member of the public whose invitation to enter has been withdrawn refuses to leave, he thereby becomes a trespasser and may be prosecuted under the Petty Trespass Act [R.S.O. 1960, c. 294 (now R.S.O. 1970, c. 347)]. Here, the invitation extended by the owner was of a general nature and included tenants, employees, agents and all persons having or seeking business relations with the tenants. However, notwithstanding the general nature of the invitation, the owner did not thereby lose its right to withdraw the invitation from the general public or any particular member thereof. In addition, it is also our view with respect to trespass that possession does not cease to be exclusive so long as there is the right to control entry of the general public, and here the owner had not relinquished that right of control.\nThe brief judgment in this Court, answering in the negative the question asked, neither adopted nor repudiated the reasons delivered in the Court of Appeal but it should not be overlooked that when the Peters case was before the Ontario Court of Appeal, counsel for Peters relied upon the decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Grosvenor Park Shopping Centre Ltd. v. Waloshin (1964), 49 W.W.R. 237, 46 D.L.R. (2d) 750. That case arose out of injunction proceedings during a strike of employees of Loblaw Groceterias Co. Ltd. in Saskatoon who were picketing with placards on the sidewalks adjacent to store premises located in a shopping centre. The pertinent part of the judgment of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal reads [p. 755]:\nLearned counsel for the appellant argued that the respondent did not have that degree of possession essential to an action in trespass.\nThe area upon which it is alleged the appellants have trespassed is part of what is well known as a shopping centre. While legal title to the area is in the respondent, it admits in its pleadings that it has granted easements to the many tenants. The evidence also establishes that the respondent has extended an unrestricted invitation to the public to enter upon the premises. The very nature of the operation is one in which the respondent, both in its own interests and in the interests of its tenants, could not do otherwise. Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that the respondent is in actual possession. The most that can be said is that the respondent exercises control over the premises but does not exercise that control to the exclusion of other persons. For that reason, therefore, the respondent cannot maintain an action in trespass against the appellants: vide 38 Hals., 3rd ed., p. 743, para. 1212. Support, too, for this view may be found in Zeller\u0026rsquo;s (Western) Ltd. v. Retail Food \u0026amp; Drug Clerks Union, Local 1518 (1963), 45 W.W.R. 337, 42 D.L.R. (2d) 582 (B.C. C.A.).\nGale C.J.O., in Peters, offered this observation with respect to Grosvenor Park, supra [p. 146]:\nThe solicitor for the appellant relied very heavily upon a decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Grosvenor Park Shopping Centre Ltd. v. Waloshin [supra]. If our view in this appeal does not harmonize with the reasoning of the Court in the Grosvenor Park case, we must respectfully disagree with that reasoning.\nSo when the Peters case came to this Court for consideration the Court had before it the reasoning of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in that case and the reasoning, difficult to reconcile, of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Grosvenor Park; the reasoning of the Ontario Court prevailed. There has been no suggestion that Peters was wrongly decided; therefore, I would think it must be regarded as controlling unless it can properly be distinguished from the case at bar. No distinction can be made on the ground of contract; there is a copy of the lease from Fairview to Dominion Stores among the papers but it would not appear, nor has it been argued, that any distinction can rest on that document. As to a possible statutory distinction, the Petty Trespass Acts of Manitoba and Ontario do not differ in any material respect and indeed s. 24 of The Labour Relations Act, 1972 (Man.), c. 75, specifically preserves rights against trespassers. Therefore it would seem that the appeal must succeed unless a valid distinction can be drawn on the ground that the president of the Brampton Labour Council in Peters was a mere member of the general public from whom permission to remain on the premises could be withdrawn at will, whereas Mrs. Carswell was an employee of one of the tenants of the shopping centre on strike in support of a current labour dispute from whom permission to remain on the premises could not, as a matter of law, be withdrawn. I find myself unable to accept that any ground in law supports such a distinction.\nThe evidence discloses that distribution of pamphlets or leaflets in the mall of Polo Park Shopping Centre or on the parking lot has never been permitted by the management of the centre and that this prohibition has extended to tenants of the centre. The centre, as a matter of policy, has not permitted any person to walk in the mall carrying placards. There is nothing in the evidence supporting the view that in the present case the owner of the centre was acting out of caprice or whimsy or mala fides. In a comment entitled \u0026ldquo;Labour Law — Picketing on Shopping Centres\u0026rdquo; (1965), 43 Can. Bar Rev. 357 at 362, H. W. Arthurs referred to the following as one of the legitimate concerns of the landlord of a shopping centre:\n… while public authorities may, on behalf of the community, strike a reasonable balance between traffic and picketing on public sidewalks and streets, the shopping centre owner can hardly be expected to make such a choice; he has no authority to speak for the community; to grant picketing or parading privileges to all would invite chaos, while to do so selectively would invite commercial reprisals. He is thus driven to adopt a highly restrictive approach to granting permission to groups who wish to parade or picket in the shopping centre.\nIt is urged on behalf of Mrs. Carswell that the right of a person to picket peacefully in support of a lawful strike is of greater social significance than the proprietary rights of an owner of a shopping centre and that the rights of the owner must yield to those of the picketer. The American example has been cited but I cannot say that I find the American cases to which we have been referred of great help. The facts in Schwartz-Torrance Investment Corpn. v. Bakery and Confectionery Workers\u0026rsquo; Union, Local 31 (1964), 394 P. 2d 921, 85 S. Ct. 888, decided by the Supreme Court of California, are almost identical with those in Grosvenor Park but I think it not unimportant to note that in Schwartz-Torrance Tobriner J., early in his judgment, drew attention to the fact that the Legislature of the State of California had expressly declared that the public policy of the state favoured concerted activities of employees for the purpose of collective bargaining and had enacted the policy into an exception to the criminal trespass law. Construing that exception, the California Supreme Court in a case antedating Schwartz-Torrance had concluded that the Legislature, in dealing with trespasses, had specifically subordinated the rights of the property owner to those of persons engaged in lawful labour activities. Schwartz-Torrance is, therefore, of small aid in this case and indeed can be said to support, in a negative sense, a position inimical to that of Mrs. Carswell. And one need only read Amalgamated Food Employees\u0026rsquo; Union, Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza Inc. (1968), 391 U.S. 308, and then read Lloyd Corpn. v. Tanner (1972), 407 U.S. 551, 92 S. Ct. 2219, to apprehend the uncertainties and very real difficulties which emerge when a court essays to legislate as to what is and what is not a permissible activity within a shopping centre.\nThe submission that this Court should weigh and determine the respective values to society of the right to property and the right to picket raises important and difficult political and socio-economic issues, the resolution of which must, by their very nature, be arbitrary and embody personal economic and social beliefs. It raises also fundamental questions as to the role of this Court under the Canadian constitution. The duty of the court, as I envisage it, is to proceed in the discharge of its adjudicative function in a reasoned way from principled decision and established concepts. I do not for a moment doubt the power of the court to act creatively \u0026mdash; it has done so on countless occasions; but manifestly one must ask: what are the limits of the judicial function? There are many and varied answers to this question. Holmes J. said in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen (1917), 244 U.S. 205 at 221, 37 S. Ct. 524, 61 L. Ed. 1086.\nI recognize without hesitation that judges do and must legislate, but they can do it only interstitially; they are confined from molar to molecular actions.\nCardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process (1921), p. 141, recognized that the freedom of the judge is not absolute in this expression of his view:\nThe judge, even when he is free, is still not wholly free. He is not to innovate at pleasure. He is not a knight-errant, roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty or of goodness. He is to draw his inspiration from consecrated principles.\nThe former Chief Justice of the Australian High Court, Sir Owen Dixon, in an address delivered at Yale University in September 1955, \u0026ldquo;Concerning Judicial Method\u0026rdquo;, had this to say:\nBut in our Australian High Court we have had as yet no deliberate innovators bent on express change of acknowledged doctrine. It is one thing for a court to seek to extend the application of accepted principles to new cases or to reason from the more fundamental of settled legal principles to new conclusions or to decide that a category is not closed against unforeseen instances which in reason might be subsumed thereunder. It is an entirely different thing for a judge, who is discontented with a result held to flow from a long accepted legal principle, deliberately to abandon the principle in the name of justice or of social necessity or of social convenience. The former accords with the technique of the common law and amounts to no more than an enlightened application of modes of reasoning traditionally respected in the courts. It is a process by the repeated use of which the law is developed, is adapted to new conditions, and is improved in content. The latter means an abrupt and almost arbitrary change.\n(See also Jaffe, English and American Judges as Lawmakers (1969); McWhinney, Canadian Jurisprudence (1958), pp. 1-23; Friedmann, Law in a Changing Society, 2nd ed. (1972), pp. 49-90; and Allen, Law in the Making, 7th ed. (1964), pp. 302-11.)\nSociety has long since acknowledged that a public interest is served by permitting union members to bring economic pressure to bear upon their respective employers through peaceful picketing, but the right has been exercisable in some locations and not in others and to the extent that picketing has been permitted on private property the right hitherto has been accorded by statute. For example, s. 87 of The Labour Code of British Columbia, 1973 (2nd Sess.) (B.C.), c. 122, provides that no action lies in respect of picketing permitted under the Act for trespass to real property to which a member of the public ordinarily has access.\nAnglo-Canadian jurisprudence has traditionally recognized, as a fundamental freedom, the right of the individual to the enjoyment of property and the right not to be deprived thereof, or any interest therein, save by due process of law. The Legislature of Manitoba has declared in The Petty Trespasses Act that any person who trespasses upon land, the property of another, upon or through which he has been requested by the owner not to enter, is guilty of an offence. If there is to be any change in this statute law \u0026mdash; if A is to be given the right to enter and remain on the land of B against the will of B \u0026mdash; it would seem to me that such a change must be made by the enacting institution, the Legislature, which is representative of the people and designed to manifest the political will, and not by the court.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba and restore the judgment of the County Court Judge.\nLaskin C.J.C. (dissenting)\u0026ndash; # I would be content to adopt the reasons of Freedman C.J.M. [1974] 4 W.W.R. 394 and, accordingly, to dismiss this appeal without more if I did not feel compelled, in view of the course of argument, to add some observations bearing on the decision of this Court in Peters v. The Queen (1971), 2 C.C.C. (2d) 339n, 17 D.L.R. (3d) 128, dismissing an appeal from the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal, [1971] 1 O.R. 597, 2 C.C.C. (2d) 336, 16 D.L.R. (3d) 143. The observations I am about to make about the Peters case carry into two areas of concern respecting the role of this Court as the final Court in this country in both civil and criminal causes. Those areas are, first, whether this Court must pay mechanical deference to stare decisis and, second, whether this Court has a balancing role to play, without yielding place to the Legislature, where an ancient doctrine, in this case trespass, is invoked in a new setting to suppress a lawful activity supported both by legislation and by a well-understood legislative policy.\nThe factual setting for these issues in the present case needs no great elaboration. The locale is a shopping centre in which a large number of tenants carry on a wide variety of businesses. The shopping centre has the usual public amenities such as access roads, parking lots and sidewalks which are open for use by members of the public who may or may not be buyers at the time they come to the shopping centre.\nThere can be no doubt that at least where a shopping centre is freely accessible to the public, as is the one involved in the present case, the private owner has invested members of the public with a right of entry during the business hours of his tenants and with a right to remain there subject to lawful behaviour. Counsel for the appellant owner in this case stated that members of the public entered and remained in the shopping centre at the owner\u0026rsquo;s whim, under what may be called a revocable licence, and were subject to liability for trespass if they did not leave when requested regardless of how proper their conduct was at the time. This is an extravagant position. It is a sufficient demonstration of its hollowness to point out that a member of the public who came to the shopping centre at the express invitation of a tenant for business reasons could not lawfully be excluded by the private owner. I need not pursue the extreme of the appellant\u0026rsquo;s submission but put it to one side to deal with the specific trespass claim that arose here.\nAn employee of a tenant in the shopping centre participated in a lawful strike and then proceeded to picket peacefully on the sidewalk in front of the tenant\u0026rsquo;s premises. The struck employer took no action to prohibit the picketing and, on the record, an action by the employer would probably have been unsuccessful. The owner of the shopping centre introduced himself into the situation and told the picketer, the respondent in this appeal, that picketing was not permitted in any area of the shopping centre and if she did not leave she would be charged with trespass. He advised her to move to a public sidewalk which was some distance away. She continued to picket on the shopping centre sidewalk and charges against her under The Petty Trespasses Act, R.S.M. 1970, c. P50, followed.\nThe Peters case, supra, also involved picketing in a shopping centre. However, the picketing there arose not out of a labour dispute with an employer tenant of premises in the shopping centre but was by way of a boycott appeal against the selling of California grapes. The oral reasons of Gale C.J.O. for the Ontario Court of Appeal were undoubtedly geared to the specific facts before him and it is therefore unfair, in my view, to read, without that context, his general statement that [p. 146]:\n… an owner who has granted a right of entry to a particular class of the public has not thereby relinquished his or its right to withdraw its invitation to the general public or any particular member thereof, and that if a member of the public whose invitation to enter has been withdrawn refuses to leave, he thereby becomes a trespasser and may be prosecuted under the Petty Trespass Act [R.S.O. 1960, c. 294].\nBe that as it may, the case came to the Supreme Court of Canada not at large but on two specific questions of law, the second of which concerned the constitutional validity of the provincial Petty Trespass Act, a matter which did not become an issue here. That was made clear to the sole intervenant in the present case, the Attorney General for Saskatchewan, who appeared to defend the validity of such legislation.\nThe first question put to this Court in the Peters case was framed as follows:\nDid the learned Judges in appeal err in law in determining that the owner of the property had sufficient possession of the shopping plaza sidewalk to be capable of availing itself of the remedy for trespass under the Petty Trespass Act, section 1(1)?\nThis question, a strictly legal one without any context of fact, was answered unanimously in the negative by the full Court of which I was a member. The Court gave the briefest of oral reasons and I regarded the answer as a response to a narrow question of whether a shopping centre owner can have sufficient possession of a sidewalk therein to support a charge of trespass under the provincial Act. The question, to me, was whether the owner had divested itself of possession so as to make the shopping centre sidewalk a public way upon which there could be no trespass as against such owner in any circumstances.\nIt is, of course, open to others to read this Court\u0026rsquo;s disposition of the Peters case differently but I can say for myself that the brief reasons would not have sufficed had the question that was asked been put in a factual frame as is often done when questions are formulated for the consideration of this Court. For me, it follows that the Peters case is neither in law nor in fact a controlling authority for the present case which came to this Court not upon specific questions of fact but at large so as to enable this Court to consider both law and fact as they bear on the position inter se of the shopping centre owner and of the lawful picketer in a legal strike.\nMy brother Spence, who also sat as a member of this Court in the Peters case, associates himself with me in the view of it that I have put forward, and I would think that this should give pause to any suggestion that the Peters case has concluded the issue now before us, an issue arising on different facts and on a broader question of law than that to which an answer was sought and given in the Peters case.\nThis Court, above all others in this country, cannot be simply mechanistic about previous decisions, whatever be the respect it would pay to such decisions. What we would be doing here, if we were to say that the Peters case, because it was so recently decided, has concluded the present case for us, would be to take merely one side of a debatable issue and say that it concludes the debate without the need to hear the other side.\nI do not have to call upon pronouncements of members of this Court that we are free to depart from previous decisions in order to support the pressing need to examine the present case on its merits. Pressing, because there are probably many hundreds of shopping centres in this country where similar issues have arisen and will arise. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has dealt with a picketing situation in a shopping centre in a different way than did the Ontario Court of Appeal in the Peters case, albeit on different facts and in respect of civil action rather than in a penal proceeding: see Grosvenor Park Shopping Centre Ltd. v. Waloshin (1964), 49 W.W.R. 237, 46 D.L.R. (2d) 750 (Sask. C.A.). There are judgments in related cases, that were cited to us in argument, that need to be taken into consideration in order to enable this Court to begin to draw lines which courts are habitually called upon to do. There should be, at least, some indication that the Court has addressed itself to the difficult issues that reside in the competing contentions that were made in this case and to which I will refer later on in these reasons. But, above all, this Court has not shown itself to be timorous in tackling important issues where it could be said, with some justification, that an important consideration was absent from an earlier judgment, even a recent one, upon which reliance was placed to foreclose examination of a similar issue in a subsequent case.\nI refer to the judgment of this Court in Augustine\u0026rsquo;s Farm Dairy v. Milk Commn. of Ont., [1973] S.C.R. 131, as evidence of the approach which I think is compelled in the present case. Of course, it was a different case and turned on the neglect of this Court to consider earlier conflicting decisions when deciding the case that was pressed as an authority to conclude the decision in the Augustine\u0026rsquo;s Farm Dairy case itself. What is important, however, is not whether we have a previous decision involving a \u0026ldquo;brown horse\u0026rdquo; by which to judge a pending appeal involving a \u0026ldquo;brown horse\u0026rdquo;, but rather what were the principles and, indeed, the facts, upon which the previous case, now urged as conclusive, was decided. I need only add that there can be no doubt on the question whether the present case provides a developed set of facts that raise the important issues of law that require decision here. It certainly does.\nI come then to those issues, and they can only be understood if we look at the present case not only from the position asserted by the shopping centre owner but as well from the position asserted by the lawful picketer. An ancient legal concept, trespass, is urged here in all its pristine force by a shopping centre owner in respect of areas of the shopping centre which have been opened by him to public use, and necessarily so because of the commercial character of the enterprise based on tenancies by operators of a variety of businesses. To say in such circumstances that the shopping centre owner may, at his whim, order any member of the public out of the shopping centre on penalty or liability for trespass if he refuses to leave does not make sense if there is no proper reason in that member\u0026rsquo;s conduct or activity to justify the order to leave.\nTrespass in its civil law sense, and in its penal sense too, connotes unjustified invasion of another\u0026rsquo;s possession. Where a dwelling house is concerned, the privacy associated with that kind of land-holding makes any unjustified or unprivileged entry a trespass, technically so even if no damage occurs. A court however would be likely to award only nominal damages for mere unprivileged entry upon another\u0026rsquo;s private premises where no injury occurs, and it is probable that the plaintiff would be ordered to pay costs for seeking empty vindication. If the trespasser refuses to leave when ordered, he could be forcibly removed but, more likely, the police would be called and the issue would be resolved at that point, or a basis for an action or for a penal charge would arise. In short, apart from privileged entry, a matter to which I will return in these reasons, there is a significant element of protection of privacy in resort to trespass to exclude or remove persons from private dwellings.\nThe considerations which underlie the protection of private residences cannot apply to the same degree to a shopping centre in respect of its parking areas, roads and sidewalks. Those amenities are closer in character to public roads and sidewalks than to a private dwelling. All that can be urged from a theoretical point of view to assimilate them to private dwellings is to urge that if property is privately owned, no matter the use to which it is put, trespass is as appropriate in the one case as in the other and it does not matter that possession, the invasion of which is basic to trespass, is recognizable in the one case but not in the other. There is here, on this assimilation, a legal injury albeit no actual injury. This is a use of theory which does not square with economic or social fact under the circumstances of the present case.\nWhat does a shopping centre owner protect, for what invaded interest of his does he seek vindication in ousting members of the public from sidewalks and roadways and parking areas in the shopping centre? There is no challenge to his title and none to his possession nor to his privacy when members of the public use those amenities. Should he be allowed to choose what members of the public come into those areas when they have been opened to all without discrimination? Human rights legislation would prevent him from discriminating on account of race, colour or creed or national origin, but counsel for the appellant would have it that members of the public can otherwise be excluded or ordered to leave by mere whim. It is contended that it is unnecessary that there be a reason that can stand rational assessment. Disapproval of the owner, in assertion of a remote control over the \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; areas of the shopping centre, whether it be disapproval of picketing or disapproval of the wearing of hats or anything equally innocent, may be converted (so it is argued) into a basis of ouster of members of the public. Can the common law be so devoid of reason as to tolerate this kind of whimsy where public areas of a shopping centre are concerned?\nIf it was necessary to categorize the legal situation which, in my view, arises upon the opening of a shopping centre, with public areas of the kind I have mentioned (at least where the opening is not accompanied by an announced limitation on the classes of public entrants), I would say that the members of the public are privileged visitors whose privilege is revocable only upon misbehaviour (and I need not spell out here what this embraces) or by reason of unlawful activity. Such a view reconciles both the interests of the shopping centre owner and of the members of the public, doing violence to neither and recognizing the mutual or reciprocal commercial interests of shopping centre owners, business tenants and members of the public upon which the shopping centre is based.\nThe respondent picketer in the present case is entitled to the privilege of entry and to remain in the public areas to carry on as she did (without obstruction of the sidewalk or incommoding of others) as being not only a member of the public but being as well, in relation to her peaceful picketing, an employee involved in a labour dispute with a tenant of the shopping centre, and hence having an interest, sanctioned by the law, in pursuing legitimate claims against her employer through the peaceful picketing in furtherance of a lawful strike.\nThe civil law doctrine of abusive exercise of rights provides, in my opinion, an apt analogue for the present case. I do not press it as having precise application, but insofar as it embraces a balancing of rights, a consideration of the relativity of rights involving advertence to social purpose as well as to personal advantage, it is the peaceful picketer who has cause for complaint against interference with her rather than the shopping centre owner having a legally cognizable complaint: see, generally, Gutteridge, \u0026ldquo;Abuse of Rights\u0026rdquo; (1933-35), 5 Camb. L.J. 22; Castel, The Civil Law System of the Province of Quebec (1962), pp. 409 ff. The shopping centre owner has no overriding or even co-equal interest to serve in intervening in the labour dispute and, if anything, is acting as surrogate of the struck tenant in a situation where the latter has not and probably could not claim redress or relief.\nIt seems to me that the present case involves a search for an appropriate legal framework for new social facts which show up the inaptness of an old doctrine developed upon a completely different social foundation. The history of trespass indicates that its introduction as a private means of redress was directed to breaches of the peace or to acts likely to provoke such breaches. Its subsequent enlargement beyond these concerns does not mean that it must be taken as incapable of further adaptation but must be applied on what I can only characterize as a level of abstraction which ignores the facts. Neither logic nor experience (to borrow from Holmes\u0026rsquo; opening sentence in his classic The Common Law) supports such a conclusion.\nRecognition of the need for balancing the interests of the shopping centre owner with competing interests of members of the public when in or on the public areas of the shopping centre engaged courts in the United States a little earlier than it did the courts in this country. Making every allowance for any constitutional basis upon which courts there grappled with this problem, their analyses are helpful because they arise out of the same economic and social setting in which the problem arises here. Thus, there is emphasis on unrestricted access to shopping centres from public streets and on the fact that access by the public is the very reason for the existence of shopping centres; there is the comparison drawn between the public markets of long ago and the shopping centre as a modern market place; there is the appreciation that in the light of the interests involved there can be no solution to their reconciliation by positing a flat all or nothing approach. The cases in the United States, and I cite a few of them here without further elaboration, appear to me to reject the appellant\u0026rsquo;s proposition that (as his counsel put it) \u0026ldquo;the issue is trespass, not picketing\u0026rdquo; because that, in my opinion, involves a predetermination without regard to the issues of fact: see Schwartz-Torrance Investment Corpn. v. Bakery and Confectionary Workers\u0026rsquo; Union, Local 31 (1964), 394 P. 2nd 921, 85 S. Ct. 888; Amalgamated Clothing Workers of Amer. v. Wonderland Shopping Centre Inc. (1963), 122 N.W. 2d 785; Amalgamated Food Employees\u0026rsquo; Union, Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza Inc. (1968), 391 U.S. 308; Lloyd Corpn. Ltd. v. Tanner (1972), 407 U.S. 551, 92 S. Ct. 2219.\nA more appropriate approach, to which I adverted earlier, is to recognize a continuing privilege in using the areas of the shopping centre provided for public passage subject to limitations arising out of the nature of the activity thereon and to the object pursued thereby, and subject as well to a limitation against material damage. There is analogy in existing conceptions of privilege as an answer to intentional torts, such as trespass. The principle is expressed in Prosser on Torts, 4th ed. (1971), at p. 98, as follows:\n‘Privilege\u0026rsquo; is the modern term applied to those considerations which avoid liability where it might otherwise follow. In its broader sense, it is applied to any immunity which prevents the existence of a tort; but in its more common usage, it signifies that the defendant has acted to further an interest of such social importance that it is entitled to protection, even at the expense of damage to the plaintiff. He is allowed freedom of action because his own interests, or those of the public require it, and social policy will best be served by permitting it. The boundaries of the privilege are marked out by current ideas of what will most effectively promote the general welfare.\nThe question of \u0026lsquo;privilege\u0026rsquo; arises almost exclusively in connection with intentional torts. Much the same considerations have weight in negligence cases, in determining whether the defendant\u0026rsquo;s conduct is reasonable under the circumstances. Negligence, however, is a matter of risk and probability of harm; and where the likelihood of injury to the plaintiff is relatively slight, the defendant will necessarily be allowed greater latitude than where the harm is intended, or substantially certain to follow.\nAs the defendant\u0026rsquo;s interest gains weight in the scale of social values, his privilege becomes greater. It may be absolute, in the sense that there is immunity from all liability, regardless of the motive or purpose for which he acts. The acts of judicial officers, done under authority of law, for example, are absolutely privileged, even though malicious or corrupt. It may be conditioned upon a proper motive and reasonable behavior, as in the case of the privilege of self-defense. It may be limited, in the sense that the defendant may not be restrained in advance from acting, and is not liable for any mere technical tort, but is still liable for any substantial damage that he may cause. The sliding scale by which the law balances the interests of the parties to accomplish a social purpose is nowhere better illustrated than in the field of privilege.\nSee also Bohlen, \u0026ldquo;Incomplete Privilege to Inflict Intentional Invasions of Interests of Property and Personality\u0026rdquo; (1926), 39 Harvard L.R. 307, where it is said at pp. 319-20:\nThe liability for a harmless invasion of either an interest of personality or property is either punitive or compensatory. In so far as it is punitive, there is no reason why, if the good likely to result from an act is greater than the harm it is intended to cause, the actor should be punished either criminally by fine or imprisonment, or by damages, whether labelled punitive or not, imposed in a civil action. And clearly there is no more reason for imposing either punishment because the harm intended and done is a harmless invasion of a dignitary interest of personality rather than a harmless invasion of a similar interest of property.\nIllustrations were given during the course of argument of situations which might put the respondent\u0026rsquo;s activity in a different light relative to the place of picketing and to the object of picketing and which, correlatively, might provide some redeeming interest of the shopping centre owner in exercising control over the public areas. The character of a shopping centre, such as the one involved here, is one thing, and the nature and place of activities carried on there are something else. I would agree that it does not follow that because unrestricted access is given to members of the public to certain areas of the shopping centre during business hours, those areas are available at all times during those hours and in all circumstances to any kind of peaceful activity by members of the public, regardless of the interest being prompted by that activity and regardless of the numbers of members of the public who are involved. The Court will draw lines here as it does in other branches of the law as may be appropriate in the light of the legal principle and particular facts. In the present case it is the respondent who has been injured rather than the shopping centre owner.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\n"},{"id":104,"href":"/casebook/shelter/heegsma/","title":"Heegsma v. Hamilton (City)","section":"Chapter 4","content":" Ramsay J. \u0026ndash; # The applicants are 14 homeless individuals who apply for a declaration that the City of Hamilton\u0026rsquo;s enforcement of its Parks by-law during the period from August 2021 to August 2023 breached their right under the Charter to life, liberty and security of the person (s.7) and to equal benefit of the law (s.15). They seek damages from the City.\nThe applicants say that they were evicted from encampments during the period from August 2021 to August 2023 in breach of the Charter, and that they suffered harm as a result.\nThe record consists of some 10,000 pages. These reasons do not reflect the massive amount of work that was done by both sets of lawyers. Their work has allowed me to deal with the issues in what I hope is a complete but concise manner.\nI was reminded by counsel for the applicants that while the legislature represents the will of the people, the court holds the moral compass that is often the only protection for the most vulnerable. I observe that the most vulnerable includes not only the homeless but also the elderly person and the child who want to use a sidewalk or a city park without tiptoeing through used needles and human faeces.\nThe by-laws and their enforcement\nBy-Law 01-219 provides:\n3 No person shall enter into or be in any park between the hours of eleven in the afternoon (11:00 p.m.) and six o\u0026rsquo;clock in the forenoon (6:00 a.m.), except where after hours use of a park has been approved by the City.\n12 Unless authorized by the Director or by permit, no person shall encroach upon or take possession of any park, by any means whatsoever, including the construction, installation or maintenance of any fence or structure, the dumping or storage of any materials, or planting, cultivating, grooming or landscaping, thereon.\n17 Unless authorized by permit, no person shall dwell, camp or lodge in any park.\n18 Unless authorized by permit, no person shall place, install or erect any temporary or permanent tent or structure in any park.\nBy-Law 97-162 provides:\n12.1 For the purposes of this subsection:\n\u0026ldquo;cease\u0026rdquo; means to stop or bring to an end.\n\u0026ldquo;congregate\u0026rdquo; means to gather into a group of more than one person.\n\u0026ldquo;obstruct\u0026rdquo; means to interfere with or make difficult of passage.\n\u0026ldquo;officer\u0026rdquo; means a sworn member of the Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Service or municipal by-law enforcement officer appointed by the City of Hamilton.\n12.2 No person shall congregate and sit or stand so as to obstruct the free passage of either pedestrian or vehicular traffic on any streets or sidewalks regulated by this By-law.\n12.3 Any person who obstructs pedestrian or vehicular traffic on a sidewalk or street shall, when directed to do so by an officer, cease such obstruction.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n12.5 Sworn members of the Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Service and municipal by-law enforcement officers of the City of Hamilton are authorized to enforce the provisions of this by-law.\nHamilton is a single tier municipality. It is not disputed that it had the authority under the Municipal Act, 2001, S.O. 2001 c. 25, to enact the by-laws in question. The by-laws were enforced in accordance with protocols in operation during three time periods.\nFrom October 2020 to August 2021 (\u0026ldquo;the old protocol\u0026rdquo;) encampments were permitted in public parks as long as they were not on sidewalks or playgrounds. Upon receipt of a complaint the Outreach Team would speak with encampment residents and assess their needs, using a decision assistance tool which is, I take it, a form of questionnaire. The residents were given an \u0026ldquo;acuity score.\u0026rdquo; If they had a low score they would be given 14 days to leave, and they would be offered housing supports. If they had a high score they would not be given a deadline.\nFrom August 2021 to August 2023 (\u0026ldquo;the encampment process\u0026rdquo;) the policy was again complaint driven. The Outreach Team would visit, offer supports and seek voluntary compliance. If there was no compliance a trespass notice would be served. The process called for police to execute the notice, but it is not clear that in fact they did. No one was asked to leave at night. City staff would clean up the park if the occupants had left. I find that they did not clean up a park when a resident was present. They did not dispose of property that had not been abandoned. I reject the evidence to the contrary.\nSince 2023 (\u0026ldquo;the new protocol\u0026rdquo;) the policy has been that temporary shelters may be erected indefinitely in parks as long as they are not within a certain distance of sensitive areas, such as schools. There is an enforcement process involving multiple steps.\nThe position of the applicants is that the enforcement of the by-law during the encampment process period breached their rights because of two circumstances:\n(a) They were kept from staying overnight when their were insufficient accessible shelter beds to accommodate them; and\n(b) They were kept from staying during the daytime, that is, they were forced to pack up and move, potentially every morning.\nAgain, I find that they were not prevented from staying overnight.\nIf they had been, the City might have been in breach of s.7 of the Charter according to British Columbia jurisprudence (Victoria (City) v. Adams 2009 BCCA 563) which has been adopted by this court in Waterloo (Regional Municipality) v. Persons Unknown 2023 ONSC 670 and Kingston (City) v. Doe 2023 ONSC 6662. I say \u0026ldquo;might have been\u0026rdquo; because Adams dealt with the case where the by-law allowed the public to stay in parks overnight as long as they did not erect a shelter. The Hamilton by-law prohibits being in a park overnight.\nTo apply the protection of s.7 of the Charter to eviction during the daytime, I am asked to advance the jurisprudence to the next step. These reasons explain why I decline to do. It is implicit in my reasons that I disagree with the Adams and Waterloo cases, but it is not necessary to my decision to decline to follow them.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe shelter system and the enforcement of the by-law\nUnder any of the three policies people were never evicted as night approached, as the applicants largely confirm in their depositions. Where they state the contrary, I do not believe them. When they were evicted, they could take their chattels with them, or the City offered to store them, although not permanently. Mario Muscato and Linsley Greaves confirm this.\nThe City has spent millions of dollars on various programmes to help the homeless and on security to protect the homeless. The City\u0026rsquo;s shelter system is sometimes, but not always full to capacity. But there are overflow facilities available. The shelters do not allow animals, except service animals, because of concerns about allergies and aggressive dogs. The City\u0026rsquo;s budget for homelessness was $61.5 million for fiscal 2022. It has risen since. The City has installed washroom and shower facilities in some parks.\nIndigenous persons are over-represented among the homeless. Women are not over-represented, but there are fewer shelter spaces for them, sometimes in smaller proportion than their share of the population. There are as well a significant number of Indigenous women who are homeless.\nIn September and October 2021 the occupancy rates of the City\u0026rsquo;s shelters were as follows:\nWomen\u0026rsquo;s shelters 108% Family shelters 99% Youth shelters 61% Men\u0026rsquo;s shelters 97% Overflow facilities Hotel (women) 89% Hotel (family) Available ad hoc Hotel (couples and women) 95% Men\u0026rsquo;s 38% In addition to the City shelters there are domestic violence shelters, the YMCA, the YWCA and the Hamilton Regional Indian Centre, but I do not have statistics as to capacity and demand.\nIt is impossible to be certain, and the numbers change from time to time, but it seems from the City\u0026rsquo;s records that there may be up to 2,000 homeless persons in Hamilton on a given night. The total number of City-run shelter beds could have been 950-odd. The City has identified 506 persons as having stayed in encampments from 2020 to 2021, perhaps 200 at a time. Between May and August 2023 there were from 117 to 165 persons in encampments at a time. As of June 2024 there were 271 people staying in encampments. Records between 2021 and May 2023 were lost to a cyber attack. I infer that there are homeless persons who stay elsewhere than shelters and encampments. They could be sleeping rough, staying in shelters outside the City system, couch surfing or staying short-term with family.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSection 7 of the Charter\nIn Adams, the court held that when people are not prohibited from sleeping in a public park, a by-law that prohibits the erection of an overnight shelter in the form of tents, tarps and cardboard boxes is overbroad and therefore in contravention of section 7 of the Charter. The issue of a right to set up a semi-permanent camp, as opposed to a temporary shelter taken down each morning, was not before the court in Adams: paragraph 99.\nIn the Waterloo case, Valente J. considered Adams and the British Columbia cases that followed it in connection with an encampment on a gravel parking lot. He found that there were insufficient shelter spaces in Waterloo and that it followed that the by-law, which prohibited erecting shelter, infringed the right to life and security of the person given by section 7 of the Charter and this \u0026ldquo;notwithstanding the tremendous and praiseworthy efforts the Region has made and is continuing to make to address the plague of homelessness.\u0026rdquo; He concluded that the law had developed to the point that the Region could not prevent an overnight temporary structure unless\n(a) there was enough shelter space; and\n(b) the shelter space was truly accessible in that it met the needs of the homeless population.\nI have found that the City did not prevent anyone from staying overnight. I am asked to extend the right to stay in encampments to public parks in the daytime, that is, not to have to tear down and move every day. This extension is said to be conditional on the lack of accessible shelter space that was stipulated as a condition in the Waterloo case.\nI find it impossible to extend this conditional \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo;. First, I do not see the connection between the right and the conditions.\nSome barriers to accessibility in shelters suggested to me in the evidence are:\n(a) They do not allow animals;\n(b) They do allow animals;\n(d) They only allow couples;\n(e) They do not permit substance use;\n(f) They are not effective in preventing substance use;\n(g) They do not accommodate persons whose mental health issues make it difficult to get along with people.\n(h) They do accommodate such persons.\nA combination of different shelters would be needed to eliminate these \u0026ldquo;barriers.\u0026rdquo; They would have to have private showers and storage space for belongings. This condition is impossible.\nThe condition set by the Waterloo case is also arbitrary: Some people will not stay in a shelter whether it is available or not. Also, there are many homeless persons who do not use either shelters or encampments, and there is no reason to think that they are all sleeping rough.\nThe applicants insist that it is only City-run shelters that are relevant to the equation. That is even more arbitrary.\nMoreover, shelters also require occupants to move every day, one of the main reasons for preferring indefinite encampments. There is no logical connection between availability of shelter space and harm caused by eviction from encampments. The presence of adequate shelter space is a red herring.\nSecond, the life, liberty and security of the applicants are not put at risk by enforcement of the by-law. They are put at risk by homelessness. Encampments contribute to this risk. They are lawless, dangerous and unsanitary.\nIn all this we must not lose sight of the countervailing interest of preserving public parks. It was an important enough public interest that in the Toronto encampment injunction case Schabas J. found that it decided the balance of convenience in favour of the city notwithstanding the risk of irreparable harm: Black v. Toronto (City) 2020 ONSC 6398.\nFinally, extending the freedom from enforcement to daytime or indefinite encampment would amount to expropriating property, or at least severely limiting property rights. City officials have noticed that since the implementation of the new protocol some occupants have become more territorial, or possessive of \u0026ldquo;their\u0026rdquo; camps. Extension of freedom from enforcement would have the effect of depriving the City of the use and enjoyment of its property.\nFor these reasons, I do not extend the prohibition on enforcement to daytime or indefinite camping.\n"},{"id":105,"href":"/casebook/governance/hodge/","title":"Hodge v the Queen","section":"Chapter 2","content":" Judgement of the Lords of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council # The Appellant, Archibald Hodge, the proprietor of a tavern known as the St. James Hotel, in the city of Toronto, and who, on the 7th May 1881, was the holder of a license for the retail of spirituous liquors in his tavern, and also licensed to keep a billiard saloon, was summoned before the Police Magistrate of Toronto, for a breach of the Resolutions of the License Commissioners of Toronto, and was convicted on evidence sufficient to sustain the conviction if the magistrate had authority in law to make it.\nThe conviction is as follows, viz.:\nCanada: Province of Ontario, County of York, City of Toronto, to wit: Be it remembered, that on the 19th day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-one, at the city of Toronto, in the county of York, Archibald G. Hodge, of the said city, is convicted before me, George Taylor Denison, Esquire, Police Magistrate in and for the said city of Toronto, for that he, the said Archibald G. Hodge, being a person who, after the passing of the Resolution hereinafter mentioned, received, and who, at the time of the committing of the offence herein-after mentioned, held a license under the Liquor License Act, for and in respect of the tavern known as the St. James\u0026rsquo; Hotel, situate on York Street, within the city of Toronto, on the seventh day of May in the year aforesaid, at the said city of Toronto, did unlawfully permit, allow, and suffer \u0026amp; billiard table to be used, and a game of billiards to be played thereon in the said tavern, during the time prohibited by the Liquor License Act for the sale of liquor therein, to wit, after the hour of seven o\u0026rsquo;clock at night on the said seventh day of May, being Saturday, against the form of the Resolution of the License Commissioners for the city of Toronto for regulating taverns and shops, passed on the twenty-fifth day of April, in the year aforesaid, in such case made and provided. Thomas Dexter, of said city, License Inspector of the city of Toronto, being the complainant. And I adjudge the said Archibald G. Hodge, for his said offence, to forfeit and pay the sum of twenty dollars, to be paid and applied according to law; and also to pay to the said Thomas Dexter the sum of two dollars and eighty-five cents for his costs in this behalf; and if the said several sums be not paid forthwith, then I order that the same be levied by distress and sale of goods and chattels of the said Archibald G. Hodge; and in default of sufficient distress, I adjudge the said Archibald G. Hodge to be imprisoned in the common gaol of the said city of Toronto and county of York, at Toronto, in the county of York, and there be kept at hard labour for the space of fifteen days, unless the said sums, and the costs and charges of conveying of the sail Archibald C. Hodge to the said gaol, shall be sooner paid.\nOn the 27th May IS81, a rule Nisi was obtained to remove that conviction into the Court of Queen\u0026rsquo;s Bench for Ontario, in order that it should be quashed as illegal, on the grounds, 1st, that the said Resolution of the said License Commissioners is illegal and unauthorized; 2nd, that the said License Commissioners had no authority to pass the Resolution prohibiting the game of billiards as in the said Resolution, nor had they power to authorize the imposition of a fine, or, in default of payment thereof, imprisonment for a violation of the said Resolution; 3rd, the Liquor License Act, under which the said Commissioners have assumed to pass the said Resolution, is beyond the authority of the Legislature of Ontario, and does not authorize the said Resolution.\nIt will be observed that the question whether the Local Legislature could confer authority on the License Commissioners to make the Resolution in question is not directly raised by the rule Nisi.\nOn the 27th June 1881, that rule was made absolute, and an order pronounced by the Court of Queen\u0026rsquo;s Bench to quash the conviction. The judgment of the Court, which seems to have been unanimous, was delivered by Hagarty, C. J., with elaborate reasons, but finally it will be found that the decision of the Court rests on one ground alone, and does not profess to decide the question which on this appeal was principally discussed before their Lordships.\nThe Chief Justice, in the course of his judgment, says:\nIt was stated to us that the parties desired to present directly to the Court the very important question whether the Local Legislature, assuming that it had the power themselves to make these regulations and create these offences, and annex penalties for their infraction, could delegate such powers to a Board of Commissioners or any other authority outside their own legislative body.\u0026quot;\nAnd, again, he adds:\nWe are thus brought in face of a very serious question, viz., the power of the Ontario Legislature to vest in the License Board the power of creating new offences and annexing penalties for their commission.\u0026quot;\nAnd concludes his judgment thus, referring to the Resolutions:\nThe Legislature has not enacted any of these, but has merely authorized each Board in its discretion to make them. It seems very difficult, in our judgement, to hold that the Confederation Act gives any such power of delegating authority, first of creating a quasi offence, and then of punishing it by fine or imprisonment. We think it is a power that must be exercised by the Legislature alone. In all these questions of ultra vires the powers of our Legislature, we consider it our wisest course not to widen the discussion by considerations not necessarily involved in the decision of the point in controversy. We, therefore, enter into no general consideration of the powvers of the Legislature to legislate on this subject; but, assuming this right so to do, we feel constrained to hold that they cannot devolve or delegate these powers to the discretion of a local Board of Commissioners. We think the Defendant bas the right to say that he has not offended against any law of the Province, and that the convictions cannot be supported.\u0026quot;\nThe case was taken from the Queen\u0026rsquo;s Bench on appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, under the Ontario Aot, 44 Viet., ch. 27, and on the 30th June 1882 that Court reversed the decision of the Queen\u0026rsquo;s Bench, and affirmed the conviction.\nTwo questions only appear to have been discussed in the Court of Appeal, 1st, that the Legislature of Ontario had not authority to enact such regulations as were enacted by the Board of Commissioners, and to create offences and annex penalties for their infraction; and, 2nd, that if the Legislature had such authority, it could not delegate it to the Board of Commissioners, or any other authority outside their own legislative body.\nThis second ground was that on which the judgment of the Court of Queen\u0026rsquo;s Bench rested.\nThe judgments delivered in the Court of Appeal by Spragge, C. J., and Burton, J. A., are able and elaborate, and were adopted by Patterson and Morrisson, J. J.s, and their Lordships have derived considerable aid from a careful consideration of the reasons given in both Courts.\nThe Appellant now seeks to reverse the decision of the Court of Appeal, both on the two grounds on which the case was discussed in that Court and on others technical but substantial, and which were urged before this Board with zeal and ability.\nThe main questions arise on an Act of the Legislature of Ontario, and on what have been called the Resolutions of the License Commissioners.\nThe Act in question is Chapter 181 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1877, and is cited \u0026ldquo;as the Liquor License Act.\u0026rdquo;\nSect. 3 of this Act provides for the appointment of a Board of License Commissioners for each city, county, union of counties, or electoral district as the Lieutenant Governor may think fit, and Sects. 4 and 5 are as follow:\nSect. 4. License Commissioners may, at any time before the first day in each year, pass a resolution, or resolutions, for regulating and determining the matters following, that is to say:\n(1.) For defining the conditions and qualifications requisite to obtain tavern licenses for the retail, within the municipality, of spirituous, fermented, or other manufactured liquors, and also shop licenses for the sale by retail, within the municipality, of such liquors in shops or places other than taverns, inns, alehouses, beerhouses, or places of public entertainment. (2.) For limiting the number of tavern and shop licenses respectively, and for defining the respective times and localities within which, and the persons to whom, such limited number may be issued within the year from the first day of May on one year till the thirtieth day of April inclusive of the next year. (3.) For declaring that in cities a number not exceeding ten persons, and in towns a number not exceeding four persons, qualified to have a tavern license, may be exempted from the necessity of having all the tavern accommodation required by law. (4.) For regulating the taverns and shops to be licensed. (5.) For fixing and defining the duties, powers, and privileges of the Inspector of Licenses of their district. Sect. 5. In and by any such Resolution of a Board of License Commissioners, the said Board may impose penalties for the infraction thereof.\u0026quot;\nSect. 43 prohibits the sale of intoxicating liquors from or after the hour of seven of the clock on Saturday till six of the clock on Monday morning thereafter.\nSect. 51 imposes on any person rho sells spirituous liquors without the license by law re-quired, or otherwise violates any other provision of the Act, in respect of which violation no other punishment is prescribed, for the first offence a penalty of not less than twenty dollars and not more than fifty dollars, besides costs, and for the second offence imprisonment with hard labour for a period not exceeding three calendar months.\nSect. 52. For punishment of offences against Sect. 43 (requiring taverns, \u0026amp;c., to be closed from seven o\u0026rsquo;clock on Saturday night until six o\u0026rsquo;clock on Monday morning), a penalty for the first offence of not less than twenty dollars with costs, or fifteen days imprisonment with hard labour, and with increasing penalties for second, third, and fourth offences; and Sect. 70 provides that where the Resolution of the License Commissioners imposes a penalty it may be recovered and enforced before a magistrate in the manner and to the extent that bye-laws of municipal corporations may be enforced under the authority of the Municipal Act.\nLicense Commissioners were duly appointed under this statute, who, on 25th April 1881, in pursuance of its provisions, made the Resolution or Regulation now questioned in relation to licensed taverns or shops in the city of Toronto, which contains (inter alia) the following paragraphs, viz.,\nNor shall any such licensed person, directly or indirectly as aforesaid, permit, allow, or suffer any bowling alley, billiard or bagatelle table to be used, or any games or amusements of the like description to be played in such tavern or shop, or in or upon any premises connected therewith, during the time prohibited by the Liquor License Act, or by this Resolution, for the sale of liquor therein.\nAny person or persons guilty of any infraction of any of the provisions of this Resolution shall, upon conviction thereof before the Police Magistrate of the city of Toronto, forfeit and pay a penalty of twenty dollars and costs; and in default of payment thereof forthwith, the said Police Magistrate shall issue his warrant to levy the said penalty by distress and sale of the goods and chattels of the offender; and in default of sufficient distress in that behalf, the said Police Magistrate shall by warrant commit the offender to the common gaol of the city of Toronto, with or without hard labour, for the period of fifteen days, unless the said penalty and costs, and all costs of distress and commitment, be sooner paid.\u0026quot;\nThe Appellant was the holder of a retail license for his tavern, and had signed an undertaking, as follows\nWe, the undersigned holdees of licenses for taverns and shops in the city of Toronto, respectively acknowledge that we have severally and respectively received a copy of the Resolution of the License Commissioners of the city of Toronto to regulate taverns and shops, passed on the 25th day of April last, hereunto annexed, upon the several dates set opposite to our respective signatures here -der written, and we severally and respectively promise, undertake, and agree to observe and perform the conditions and provisions of such resolution. 2nd May, Tavern. A. C. Hodge. (L.S.)\nHe was also the holder of a billiard license for the city of Toronto to keep a billiard saloon with one table for the year 1881, and, under it, had a billiard table in his tavern.\nHe did permit this billiard table to be used as such within the period prohibited by the Resolution of the License Commissioners, and it was for that infraction of their rules he was prosecuted and convicted.\nThe preceding statement of the facts is sufficient to enable their Lordships to determine the questions raised on the appeal.\nMr. Kerr, Q.C., and Mr. Jeune, in their full and very able argument for the Appellant, informed their Lordships that the first and principal question in the cause was whether The Liquor License Act of 1877,\u0026quot; in its 4th and 5th Sections, was ultra vires of the Ontario Legislature, and properly said that it was a matter of importance as between the Dominion Parliament and the Legislature of the Province.\nTheir Lordships do not think it necessary in the present case to lay down any general rule or rules for the construction of the British North America Act. They are impressed with the justice of an observation by Hagarty, C. J.,\nthat in all these questions of ultra vires it is the wisest course not to widen the discussion by considerations not necessarily involved in the decision of the point in controversy.\u0026quot; They do not forget that in a previous decision on this same statute (Parsons v. The Citizens Company) their Lordships recommended that, \u0026ldquo;in per forming the difficult duty of determining such questions, it will be a wise course for those on whom it is thrown to decide each case which arises as best they can, without entering more largely upon the interpretation of the statute than is necessary for the decision of the particular question in hand.\nThe Appellants contended that the Legislature of Ontario had no power to pass any Act to regulate the liquor traffic; that the whole power to pass such an Act was conferred on the Dominion Parliament, and consequently taken from the Provincial Legislature, by Sect. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867; and that it did not come within any of the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the Provincial Legislatures by Sect. 92. The class in Sect. 91. which the Liquor License Act, 1877, was said to infringe was No. 2, \u0026quot; The Regulation of Trade and Commerce,\u0026rdquo; and it was urged that the decision of this Board in Russell v. Regina was conclusive that the whole subject of the liquor traffic was given to the Dominion Parliament, and consequently taken away from the Provincial Legislature.\nIt appears to their Lordships, however, that the decision of this tribunal in that case has not the effect supposed, and that, when properly considered, it should be taken rather as an authority in support of the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nThe sole question there was, whether it was competent to the Dominion Parliament, under its general powers to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Dominion, to pass the Canada Temperance Act, 1878, which was intended to be applicable to the several provinces of the Dominion, or to such parts of the provinces as should locally adopt it. It was not doubted that the Dominion Parliament had such authority under Sect. 91, unless the subject fell within some one or more of the classes of subjects, which by Sect. 92 were assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the provinces.\nIt was in that case contended that the subject of the Temperance Act properly belonged to No. 13 of Sect. 92, \u0026ldquo;Property and Civil Rights in the Province,\u0026rdquo; which it was said belonged exclusively to the Provincial Legislature, and it was on what seems to be a misapplication of some of the reasons of this Board in observing on that contention that the Appellant\u0026rsquo;s Counsel principally relied. These observations should be interpreted according to the subject matter to which they were intended to apply.\nTheir Lordships, in that case, after comparing the Temperance Act with laws relating to the sale of poisons, observe that,\nLaws of this mature designed for the promotion of public order, safety, or morals, and which subject those who contravene them to criminal procedure and punishment, belong to the subject of public wrongs rather than to that of civil rights. They are of a nature which fall within the general authority of Parliament to make laws for the order and good government of Canada.\nAnd again:\nWhat Parliament is dealing with in legislation of this kind is not a matter in relation to property and its rights, but one relating to public order and safety. That is the primary matter dealt with, and though incidentally the free use of things in which men may have property is interfered with, that incidental interference does not alter the character of the law.\nAnd their Lordships\u0026rsquo; reasons on that part of the case are thus concluded:\nThe true nature and character of the legislation in the particular instance under discussion must always be determined, in order to ascertain the class of subject to which it really belongs. In the present case it appears to their Lordships for the reasons already given, that the matter of the Act in question does not properly belong to the class of subjects Property and Civil Rights\u0026rsquo; within the meaning of Subsection 13.\nIt appears to their Lordships that Russell v. the Queen, when properly understood, is not an authority in support of the Appellant\u0026rsquo;s contention, and their Lordships do not intend to vary or depart from the reasons expressed for their judgment in that case. The principle which that case and the case of The Citizens Insurance Company illustrate is, that subjects which in one aspect and for one purpose fall within Sect. 92, may in another aspect and for another purpose fall within Sect. 91.\nTheir Lordships proceed now to consider the subject matter and legislative character of Sects. 4 and 5 of \u0026ldquo;The Liquor License Act of 1877, cap. 181, Revised Statutes of Ontario.\u0026rdquo;\nThat Act is so far confined in its operation to municipalities in the Province of Ontario, and is entirely local in its character and operation. It authorizes the appointment of License Commissioners to act in each municipality, and empowers them to pass, under the name of Resolutions, what we know as bye-laws, or rules to define the conditions and qualifications requisite for obtaining tavern or shop licenses for sale by retail of spirituous liquors within the municipality; for limiting the number of licenses; for declaring that a limited number of persons qualified to have tavern licenses may be exempted from having all the tavern accommodation required by law, and for regulating licensed taverns and shops, for defining the duties and powers of license inspectors, and to impose penalties for infraction of their Resolutions. These seem to be all matters of a merely local nature in the province, and to be similar to, though not identical in all respects with, the powers then belonging to municipal institutions under the previously existing laws passed by the Local Parliaments.\nTheir Lordships consider that the powers intended to be conferred by the Act in question, when properly understood, are to make regulations in the nature of police or municipal regulations of a merely local character for the good government of taverns, \u0026amp;c., licensed for the sale of liquors by retail, and such as are calculated to preserve, in the municipality, peace and public decency, and repress drunkenness and disorderly and riotous conduct. As such they cannot be said to interfere with the general regulation of trade and commerce which belongs to the Dominion Parliament, and do not conflict with provisions of the Canada Temperance Act, which does not appear to have as yet been locally adopted.\nThe subjects of legislation in the Ontario Act of 1877, Sects. 4 and 5, seem to come within the heads Nos. 8, 15, and 16 of Sect. 92 of British North America Statute, 1867.\nTheir Lordships are, therefore, of opinion that, in relation to Sects. 4 and 5 of the Act in question, the Legislature of Ontario acted within the powers conferred on it by the Imperial Act of 1867, and that in this respect there is no conflict with the powers of the Dominion Parliament.\nAssuming that the Local Legislature had power to legislate to the full extent of the Resolutions passed by the License Commissioners, and to have enforced the observance of their enactments by penalties and imprisonment with or without hard labour, it was further contended that the Imperial Parliament had conferred no authority on the Local Legislature to delegate those powers to the License Commissioners or any other persons. In other words, that the power conferred by the Imperial Parliament on the Local Legislature should be exercised in full by that body, and by that body alone. The maxim delegatus non potest delegare was relied on.\nIt appears to their Lordsbips, however, that the objection thus raised by the Appellants is founded on an entire misconception of the true character and position of the Provincial Legislatures. They are in no sense delegates of or acting under any mandate from the Imperial Parliament. When the British North America Act enacted that there should be a Legislature for Ontario, and that its Legislative Assembly should have exclusive authority to make laws for the province and for provincial purposes in relation to the matters enumerated in Sect. 92, it conferred powers not in any sense to be exercised by delegation from or as agents of the Imperial Parliament, but authority as plenary and as ample within the limits prescribed by Sect. 92 as the Imperial Parliament in the plenitude of its power possessed and could bestow. Within these limits of subjects and area the Local Legislature is supreme, and has the same authority as the Imperial Parliament, or the Parliament of the Dominion, would have had under like circumstances to confide to a municipal institution or body of its own creation authority to make bye-laws or resolutions as to subjects specified in the enactment, and with the object of carrying the enactment into operation and effect.\nIt is obvious that such an authority is ancillary to legislation, and without it an attempt to provide for varying details and machinery to carry them out might become oppressive, or absolutely fail. The very full and very elaborate judgment of the Court of Appeal contains abundance of precedents for this legislation entrusting a limited discretionary authority to others, and has many illustrations of its necessity and convenience. It was argued at the bar that a Legislature committing important regulations to agents or delegates effaces itself. That is not so. It retains its powers intact, and can, whenever it pleases, destroy the agency it has created and set up another, or take the matter directly into its own hands. How far it shall seek the aid of subordinate agencies, and how long it shall continue them, are matters for each Legislature, and not for courts of law, to decide.\nTheir Lordships do not think it necessary to pursue this subject further, save to add that, if bye-laws or Resolutions are warranted, power to enforce them seems necessary and equally lawful. Their Lordships have now disposed of the real questions in the cause.\nMany other objections were raised on the part of the Appellant as to the mode in which the License Commissioners exercised the authority conferred on them, some of which do not appear to have been raised in the Court below, and others were disposed of in the course of the argument, their Lordships being clearly of opinion that the Resolutions were merely in the nature of municipal or police regulations in relation to licensed houses, and interfering with liberty of action to the extent only that was necessary to prevent disorder and the abuses of liquor licenses. But it was contended that the Provincial Legislature had no power to impose imprisonment or hard labour for breach of newly created rules or bye-laws, and could confer no authority to do so. The argument was principally directed against hard labour. It is not unworthy of observation that this point, as to the power to impose hard labour, was not raised on the rule Nisi for the Certiorari, nor is it to be found amongst the reasons against the appeal to the Appellate Court in Ontario.\nIt seems to have been either overlooked or advisedly omitted.\nIf, as their Lordships have decided, the subjects of legislation come within the powers of the Provincial Legislature, then No. 15 of Section 92 of the British North America Act, which provides for \u0026quot; the imposition of punishment by fine, penalty, or imprisonment, for enforcing any law of the Province made in relation to any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section,\u0026quot; is applicable to the case before us, and is not in conflict with No. 27 of Section 91; under these very general terms, \u0026ldquo;the imposition of punishment by imprisonment for enforcing any law,\u0026rdquo; it seems to their Lordships that there is imported an authority to add to the confinement or restraint in prison that which is generally incident to it, \u0026ldquo;hard labour;\u0026rdquo; in other words, that \u0026quot; imprisonment\u0026quot; there means restraint by confinement in a prison, with or without its usual accompaniment, \u0026ldquo;hard labour.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Provincial Legislature having thus the authority to impose imprisonment, with or without hard labour, had also power to delegate similar authority to the municipal body which it created, called the License Commissioners.\nIt is said, however, that the Legislature did not delegate such powers to the License Commissioners, and that therefore the Resolution imposing hard labour is void for excess. It seems to their Lordships that this objection is not well founded.\nIn the first place, by Sect. 5 of the Liquor License Act, the Commissioners may impose penalties. Whether the word \u0026quot; penalty\u0026quot; is well adapted to include imprisonment may be questioned, but in this Act it is so used, for Sect. 52 imposes on offenders against the provisions of Sect. 43 a penalty of 20 dollars or 15 days\u0026rsquo; imprisonment, and for a fourth offence a penalty of imprisonment with hard labour only. \u0026ldquo;Penalty\u0026rdquo; here seems to be used in its wider sense as equivalent to punishment. It is observable that in Sect. 59, where recovery of penalties is dealt with, the Act speaks of \u0026ldquo;penalties in money.\u0026rdquo; But, supposing that the \u0026ldquo;penalty\u0026rdquo; is to be confined to pecuniary penalties, those penalties may, by Sect. 70, be recovered and enforced in the manner, and to the extent, that bye-laws of municipal councils may be enforced under the authority of the Municipal Act. The word \u0026ldquo;recover\u0026rdquo; is an apt word for pecuniary remedies, and the word \u0026ldquo;enforce\u0026rdquo; for remedies against the person.\nTurning to the Municipal Act, we find that, by Sect. 484, Municipal Councils may pass be-laws for inflicting reasonable fines and penalties for the breach of any bye-laws, and for inflicting reasonable punishment by imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for the breach of any bye-laws in case the fine cannot be recovered. By Sects. 400 to 402 it is provided that fines and penalties may be recovered and enforced by summary conviction before a Justice of the Peace, and that, where the prosecution is for an offence against a municipal bye-law, the Justice may award the whole or such part of the penalty or punishment imposed by the bye-lar as he thinks fit; and that, if there is no distress found out of which a pecuniary penalty cau be levied, the Justice may commit the offender to prison for the term, or some part thereof, specified in the bye-law. If these bye-laws are to be enforced at all by fine or imprisonment, it is necessary that they should specify some amount of fine and some term of imprisonment.\nThe Liquor License Act then gives to the Commissioners either power to impose a penalty against the person directly, or power to impose a money penalty, which, when imposed, may be enforced according to Sects. 454 and 400-2 of the Municipal Act. In either case, the Municipal Act must be read to find the manner of enforcing the penalty, and the extent to which it may be enforced. The most reasonable way of construing statutes so framed is to read into the later one the passages of the former which are referred to. So reading these two statutes, the Commissioners have the same power of enforcing the penalties they impose as the Councils have of enforcing their bye-laws, whether they can impose penalties against the person directly, or only indirectly as the means of enforcing money penalties. In either case, their resolution must, in order to give the Magistrate jurisdiction, specify the amount of punishment. In either case, their resolution now under discussion is altogether within the powers conferred upon them.\nTheir Lordships do not think it necessary or useful to advert to some minor points of discusion, and are, on the whole, of opinion that the decision of the Court of Appeal of Ontario should be affirmed, and this appeal dismissed, with costs, and will so humbly advise Her Majesty.\n"},{"id":106,"href":"/context/holmes-modernism/","title":"Holmes' Modernism in Practice","section":"Context","content":"We now want to see how Holmes\u0026rsquo; ideas about the modern style play out in a case about de facto expropriation.\nAfter he wrote The Path of Law, Holmes became a leading member of the United States Supreme Court.

Perhaps I might first be permitted to state, however, what I understand to be the meaning of the word \u0026ldquo;compensation,\u0026rdquo; when applied to the sovereign right of expropriation. Now, I do not pretend to dispute, and I am quite willing to admit in the amplest possible manner, so far as my judgement goes, that this Act of Parliament was, subject to one consideration, within the power of the Local Legislature. If the one consideration be overlooked there is power in the Local Legislature as in every other sovereign body\u0026ndash;and the Local Legislature is sovereign so far as its jurisdiction extends\u0026ndash;to expropriate property for public purposes. But, Sir, as I understand the doctrine of expropriation, as we call it, or as it is better known on the other side of the line, the exercise of its power of eminent domain, there are two limitations to the exercise of that power.\nThe first and most important is that it should be exercised only in the public interest. There is no right, in the exercise of the power of eminent domain, to take from one man his property and hand it over to another unless it be in the public interest.\nThe next important qualification in the doctrine\u0026ndash;and perhaps it is more than the other, and at all events to the individual\u0026ndash;is that the expropriation should be only on payment of full compensation.\nNow, that compensation as you know, is always given where expropriation is exercised in the ordinary and familiar instances of railway companies or bridge companies. Under a Railway Act, before property can be taken for public purposes, the fair value of the property is to be given to the proprietor, and that fair value is arrived at in the manner pointed out by the Act by arbitrators selected, one by the company, one by the individual whose property is taken from him, and the third by one of the Courts of the land. But it is perfectly plain that where this doctrine is perhaps better understood than anywhere else, in the United States, no exercise of the power of eminent domain is legal or constitutional, according to their law, unless it is accompanied by compensation\u0026ndash;payment in money at the time, not payment postponed to any future date.\nNow, I am not unaware that there is no such limitation in our law; I am not unaware that, according to the doctrine of the British Parliament, the power we have and the power of the Local Legislatures have in their spheres comprehends the power, though not the right, to take away a man\u0026rsquo;s property without compensating him. But I challenge my hon. friends opposite to point out in the history of British legislation any instance in which the right of a person whose property is taken from him to receive compensation has been departed from. Although there is the absolute power, that power has been so exercised under our free form of government that it has not been found necessary to limit it as it is limited in the United States.\nNow, I wish to point out another feature of this measure\u0026ndash;that not merely, as I shall endeavour to show, is it an exercise of the power of eminent domain without adequate and proper compensation, but it is also an Act of Parliament relating peculiarly to past events. It is retroactive in its enacting clause; it does not speak merely for the future, but it legislates for the past and thus two principles of sound legislation\u0026ndash;principles of paramount importance\u0026ndash;have been violated.\nFirst, property has been taken from an individual without adequate or proper compensation; and second, the Act is retroactive in its effect, and in point of fact, determined the litigation then existing between the parties, and which gave rise to this measure. The power of eminent domain is said to be the supreme right of property appertaining to the Sovereign\u0026ndash;the power by which private property acquired by the citizens under the sovereign\u0026rsquo;s protection\u0026ndash;may be taken, or its use controlled for the public benefit without regard for the wishes of the owner. The doctrine is thus stated by Judge Colley:\nIt is the rightful authority which must rest in every sovereignty to regulate and control these rights of a public nature which pertain to its citizens in common, and to appropriate and control individual property for the public benefits as the public safety, convenience, or necessity may demand.\nThe limit to that power is this:\nThat compensation shall be made therefore; and this compensation must be pecuniary in its character, because it is in the nature of a payment for a pecuniary purchase.\nIt is said by a learned Judge, in one case in which the matter was discussed, that:\nThis authority amounts to nothing more than a power to oblige a private individual to sell and convey while the public interests required it.\nMr. Chancellor Kent, in his able commentaries, thus speaks of it:\nThe settled and fundamental doctrine is that the Government has no right to take private property for public purposes without giving just compensation; and it seems to be necessarily implied that the indemnity should, in cases which will admit of it, be previously and equitably ascertained, and be ready for reception concurrently in point of time with the actual right of eminent domain.\nAgain Judge Colley says:\nWhile the owner is not to be disseized until compensation is provided; neither, on the other hand, when the public authorities have taken such steps as to finally settle upon the appropriation, ought to be left in a state of uncertainty to what for compensation until some future time when they may see fit to occupy it.\nWell, Sir, to quote once more:\nBut, whatever be the necessity and however important to the public use, compensation must be made in money, and not in incidental benefits, in order to meet the true spirit of the constitutional provision upon that subject.\nThe general rule is clear, that although steps preliminary to expropriation may be taken without providing compensation:\nBefore any definite act be done towards the construction of improvement which is in the nature of the assertion of ownership, payment must be made or tendered or a certain and adequate remedy be provided, and unless that is done in the Act authorizing the work, the Statute is wholly unconstitutional and void.\nI have troubled the House with these extracts because I think that they lay down correct principles of legislation. I do not mean to say, Sir\u0026ndash;and I have carefully avoided, I think, stating\u0026ndash;that these regulations apply to our legislation here; but what I do mean to say is, that the same spirit which regulates the written law on the other side has governed and always governs British legislation. I defy my hon. friends opposite to point, in all the Statute-books of British legislation, to an Act of this character, intended to deprive a man of his property without giving him adequate and suitable compensation.\nNow, Sir, does this Act in any way come up to the terms of what I venture to say it should be, in order to bring it within the principles of sound legislation. The first section of the Act declares that notwithstanding any effect of the judgments of the Courts up to that time, all streams during the spring, summer and autumn freshets were open to everybody to float and transmit saw-logs and timber of other kinds. The second clause of the Act says: \u0026ldquo;that any person may go on the land and construct in any such rivers, creeks or streams any improvements he thinks proper, in order to facilitate the passage of timber.\u0026rdquo; The third provision says, that the rights therein given, and the provision therein made - contained in the foregoing sections 1st and 2nd - shall extend to and apply to all rivers, creeks and streams mentioned in the 1st section of the Act, that is to all rivers, creeks and streams which whether floatable or navigable in the state of nature, or not, have been made floatable or navigable by artificial means by any one; and the 4th section purports, or pretends to give compensation, and how does it read? The Lieutenant Governor may fix the amount which any person collecting tolls under this Act shall be at liberty to charge saw logs and different kinds of timber, or rafts, or crafts, and may from time to time, vary the same; and the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, in fixing such tolls, is to regard certain matters.\nNow, how does this matter stand practically? This property is as I pointed out before Recess, when this Act of Parliament was passed, was the property of Mr. McLaren. On the passage of this Act, it ceased to be his private, and became public property. It ought not, every hon. Member, I think, will admit, to have been transferred to the public, unless the public had paid compensation for it, or unless there was certain and sure means pointed out by the Statute by which that compensation was to be recovered. I do not think that any hon. Member in this House or that any fair-minded man in this country will for one moment content, even supposing that the use of this river was all important in a public sense, even supposing that it was a great wrong on Mr. McLaren\u0026rsquo;s part to use it solely for his own purposes, and denying its use for everybody else, that it ought to have been taken from him for public purposes, without his being paid a compensation for his property and proprietary rights.\nWell, Sir, what does this Act do? It says that tolls may be collected, and more, what has been done? Property which was McLaren\u0026rsquo;s today was tomorrow public property. It is worth so much money call it $100,000, or anything you like, whatever it may be; but where is he to get that money, the interest on that money, or the principal. It is said he may get it by tolls. But wherein is any person compelled to use that stream? Does it follow that this stream will be used by any person? Is there any certain, sure way, such as constitutional writers point out, by which this money, or the interest or the capital, or any other compensation will be given to him for depriving him of his property, which this Statute affects.\nI think, Sir, it is perfectly plain that the pretence of giving him compensation is illusory. It is perfectly certain that, across the border, this State would be deemed unconstitutional and void. It is perfectly clear that the authorities say, if this law was enacted by any State of the Union, that it would be, according to their constitution\u0026ndash;and it would be declared in the Courts in that country\u0026ndash;void and of no effect. It is not here, because the British Parliament is omnipotent because the Legislature within its sphere, is omnipotent; because when the Act goes on the Statue-book, and is assented to by royal authority, it becomes the law of the land, no matter how unjust its provisions may be in depriving a man of his property and giving it up to public uses; but this is not according to the spirit of the constitution. It is not according to the way in which the laws are administered. It is not according to what is believed to be right and honest between man and man, that for public or any other purposes, a person should be despoiled of his estate.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nMr. Blake — # [\u0026hellip;]\nI will tell you, Sir, what the hon. Gentleman proposed. This is his proposition, Mr. Speaker. He says that under the Constitution, things, which it would be impossible for the Local Legislature effectually to deprive the subject of his property except under certain conditions and with certain restrictions, existed which did not exist here. I admit that under the Constitution of Canada and the Provinces, the Local Legislatures have the power to deprive the subject of his property under these conditions; but I say that if we import into our Constitution, into the Constitution of Confederation a restriction upon that power and declare it as a majority in this House propose this night to declare, we will declare it to be the right and duty of the Government wherever that power, which he admits exists, is to be exercised, to nullify its exercise by disallowing such Acts.\nThe hon. Gentleman says that you find this in the Constitution. Why? You do not find it in the Constitution. The hon. Gentleman says that this spirit of the Constitution shall be violated; that the assent of the Constitution shall be broken, and that a new clause shall be inserted in the Constitution, giving you not the certainty of a Court on the point, but the discrete determination of a political body trying a case without hearing the other side, as to whether it comes within their competence, what the United States Constitution would forbid, and upon their arguments to decide that the law should be nullified.\nNo, Sir, I am a friend to the preservation of the rights of property, not, perhaps, after the form of the hon. Gentleman, and many of the hon. Gentleman on the other side, but I believe in the subordination of those rights to the public good.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nWell, what other remedy would he have? I know that the hon. Gentleman is aware that the remedy would be wholly inadequate. As to Mr. McLaren getting a remedy by appealing to the whole Dominion on the question whether the Government was right or wrong in disallowing this measure in his private interest, that would be quite hopeless. Therefore, this remedy, if hopeless in the Province is hopeless in the Dominion. I deny that the people of my Province are insensible to or careless about the true principles of legislation. I believe they are thoroughly alive to them, and I am content that my rights of property, humble though they are, and those of my children, shall belong to the Legislature of my country to be disposed of subject to the good sense and right feeling of that Legislature and the good sense and right feeling of the people of that Province.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n"},{"id":108,"href":"/casebook/title/indian-act/","title":"Indian Act","section":"Chapter 3","content":"18 (1) Subject to this Act, reserves are held by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of the respective bands for which they were set apart, and subject to this Act and to the terms of any treaty or surrender, the Governor in Council may determine whether any purpose for which lands in a reserve are used or are to be used is for the use and benefit of the band.\n[…]\n20 (1) No Indian is lawfully in possession of land in a reserve unless, with the approval of the Minister, possession of the land has been allotted to him by the council of the band.\n(2) The Minister may issue to an Indian who is lawfully in possession of land in a reserve a certificate, to be called a Certificate of Possession, as evidence of his right to possession of the land described therein.\n[…]\n24 An Indian who is lawfully in possession of lands in a reserve may transfer to the band or another member of the band the right to possession of the land, but no transfer or agreement for the transfer of the right to possession of lands in a reserve is effective until it is approved by the Minister.\n25 (1) An Indian who ceases to be entitled to reside on a reserve may, within six months or such further period as the Minister may direct, transfer to the band or another member of the band the right to possession of any lands in the reserve of which he was lawfully in possession.\n[…]\n28 (1) Subject to subsection (2), any deed, lease, contract, instrument, document or agreement of any kind, whether written or oral, by which a band or a member of a band purports to permit a person other than a member of that band to occupy or use a reserve or to reside or otherwise exercise any rights on a reserve is void.\n[…]\n37 (1) Lands in a reserve shall not be sold nor title to them conveyed until they have been absolutely surrendered to Her Majesty pursuant to subsection 38(1) by the band for whose use and benefit in common the reserve was set apart.\n(2) Except where this Act otherwise provides, lands in a reserve shall not be leased nor an interest in them granted until they have been designated under subsection 38(2) by the band for whose use and benefit in common the reserve was set apart.\n38 (1) A band may absolutely surrender to Her Majesty, conditionally or unconditionally, all of the rights and interests of the band and its members in all or part of a reserve.\n(2) A band may, conditionally or unconditionally, designate, by way of a surrender to Her Majesty that is not absolute, any right or interest of the band and its members in all or part of a reserve, for the purpose of its being leased or a right or interest therein being granted.\n"},{"id":109,"href":"/casebook/shelter/reserve-housing/","title":"Indigenous Legal Orders and Housing on Reserve Lands","section":"Chapter 4","content":"Professors Val Napoleon and Emily Snyder have recently published a study of housing on reserve and the role of Indigenous property laws in four Indigenous communities in northwestern British Columbia. As Napoleon and Snyder describe in the introduction to that study:1\nPaul Nadasdy has observed that in the negotiation of their land claim agreement, the Kluane First Nation in the Yukon \u0026ldquo;translate their complex reciprocal relationship with the land into an equally complex but very different language of ‘property.’\u0026rdquo; According to Indigenous political science scholar Glen Coulthard, the negotiation of land rights has reoriented \u0026ldquo;Indigenous struggle from one that was once deeply informed by the land as a system of reciprocal relations and obligations … to a struggle that is now largely for land, understood here as some material resource to be exploited in the capital-accumulation process.\u0026rdquo; While Coulthard is not addressing reserve land, the questions concerning relationships to land, economies, and governance, along with competing legal orders, are the not-so-deep undercurrents beneath the property-on-reserve debate. This larger political frame is usually ignored and replaced with debates about Indigenous property on reserve land that mainly start and remain inside unquestioned Western property constructs and ongoing colonial structures.\nPlease click here to read an excerpt from Napoleon and Snyder\u0026rsquo;s study (accessible only within Dalhousie).

We left off with the observation that beneath the issue of Aboriginal title foregrounded in St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling was the doctrine of terra nullius (\u0026ldquo;land belonging to no one\u0026rdquo;). Aspects of terra nullius—paired with the doctrine of discovery—undergird courts\u0026rsquo; continued assumption of Crown sovereignty and the exclusion of Indigenous sovereignties up to the present day. One consequence of this doctrine has been to largely exclude Indigenous legal orders from the consciousness of the common law.\nThe path charted by the courts at the end of the nineteenth century, however, was not the only possibility. An alternative to terra nullius, we might say, is treaty—a legal relationship between nations defining their scope of authority and mutual obligations. Such relationships are based on the shared recognition that each party to the treaty holds authority to govern according to their own systems of law.\nTreaty relationships between Indigenous nations and the Crown are widespread in Canada, but they are also diverse and difficult to generalize. This week we will focus on the treaty context in Mi\u0026rsquo;kma\u0026rsquo;ki / Atlantic Canada to understand how the Peace and Friendship Treaties were established in the mid-eighteenth century and then interpreted in the classical period. We will see that, with the Nova Scotia County Court\u0026rsquo;s decision in R v Syliboy, common law treaty interpretation in the region became highly restrictive and was based on a rejection of the idea of nation-to-nation relationships and of Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw systems of law and governance.\nNevertheless, Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq people have continued to use and develop these systems of law and governance. We will look at one description of Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw land tenure and ask how we might understand this system in comparison to the structures of common law reasoning we have studied so far in the course.\n"},{"id":111,"href":"/casebook/title/trusts-intro/","title":"Introduction to Trusts","section":"Chapter 3","content":"The origin of the trust lies in medieval tax estate planning and tax evasion. (Arguably, nothing has changed in the last six hundred years.) Imagine Osbert, a minor lord in the 15th century, who holds Greenacre as a tenant of Leonard, a slightly less minor lord. Osbert is getting on in years and has started to worry about the future of his family. His elder son, Aylwin, is not showing promising signs of maturity, and Osbert has come to think that Aylwin may be better suited to religious orders than the duties of managing a great estate. But Osbert’s younger son Bartholomew appears to be a fine young gentleman: athletic, patient, and wise in the ways of men. Osbert would like to provide for Aylwin, but would prefer to have Greenacre go to Bartholomew. Osbert’s problem is that the available conveyancing devices don’t work for him. If he does nothing, then Greenacre goes to Alywin at Osbert’s death under the rule of primogeniture in effect in England at the time, according to which the eldest son receives any land his father owned at his death (was “seised of,” in contemporary terminology). A will leaving Greenacre to Bartholomew doesn’t work because land could not be devised by will until the Statute of Wills in 1540. And Osbert doesn’t want to convey Greenacre (or a future interest in Greenacre) to Bartholomew now, because Bartholomew might die before him, or Aylwin might get his act together, or something else could come along to force a change in plan.\nThe solution hit on by contemporary lawyers was the “use.” Osbert conveys Greenacre to his friend Theobald “to the use of Osbert and his heirs.” Then he writes a letter to Theobald, instructing Theobald to convey Greenacre to Bartholomew at Osbert’s death. This works. When Osbert dies, Theobald owns Greenacre, so primogeniture never kicks in. Then Theobald conveys to Bartholomew while they are both alive, so again the conveyance is perfectly good. What’s more, Osbert can change his instructions to Theobald at any time by writing a new letter. And as an added bonus, because the land never passes by intestacy, the “feudal incidents”– effectively taxes payable to Leonard when a new tenant inherits – never become due. Uses became highly popular for solving numerous similar problems created by the inflexibility of the medieval system of interests in land.\nBut there was a fly in the ointment. As far as the law courts could see – or rather, as far as they were willing to look – the “to the use of” language was a superfluous, meaningless, and ineffective addition to an otherwise valid conveyance. On their view of the situation, Theobald owns Greenacre in fee simple once Osbert conveys to him. Osbert’s subsequent letter is a worthless piece of paper; much as if you wrote to Bill Gates telling him to convey to you some lakefront property in Washington. So if Theobald turned out to be untrustworthy and held on to Greenacre for himself or conveyed it to Aylwin contrary to Osbert’s instructions, Osbert’s plan would come to ruin. In such cases, Osbert and Bartholomew could obtain relief from the Chancellor, who would hold that Theobald was under a duty in equity and good conscience to follow Osbert’s instructions.\nThe use thus created what we would today call an “equitable interest” in land. Theobald remained the legal owner of Greenacre while he held it to the use of Osbert and his heirs, but Osbert was the equitable owner, since he could enforce his claims and instructions in a court of equity. Over time a variety of similar situations, in which Chancery would enforce interests in land legally owned by another, gave rise to a reasonably coherent body of equitable jurisdiction, equitable doctrine, and equitable interests in property.\nThe use is long gone, along with the medieval doctrines that necessitated it, but the modern trust shares its essential characteristics. A trust requires three people and one thing. The people are the settlor, who creates the trust; the trustee, who holds legal title to the trust property and is responsible for following the settlor’s instructions, and the beneficiary, who is entitled to receive distributions from the trust in accordance with the settlor’s instructions but does not directly control it. The thing is the trust property (or sometimes res, Latin for “thing,” or corpus, Latin for “body”), whose ownership is split between the trustee (with legal title) and the beneficiary (with equitable title).\n"},{"id":112,"href":"/casebook/title/iwasaki/","title":"Iwasaki v R","section":"Chapter 3","content":" Sheppard, D.J. — # The suppliant, Torazo Iwasaki, alleges by petition that the Custodian as trustee for the suppliant as evacuee committed a breach of trust in selling land of the suppliant without any power of sale, or by selling to the specific grantee, Salt Spring Lands Limited, and for such acts of the Custodian the Crown is liable by respondeat superior. The Crown in defence says: (1) That there was no trust; (2) That there was no breach of trust in selling; (3) That the suppliant\u0026rsquo;s claim is barred by limitation of action and by laches; (4) That the suppliant\u0026rsquo;s claim is barred by release. As the issue raises the effect of certain Orders in Council, it is convenient to recite the legislation in proper sequence. The War Measures Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 206, s. 3 [now R.S.C. 1952, c. 288], empowers the Governor-General in Council to enact such Orders in Council as he may deem necessary or advisable. That legislation has been held to be valid: Reference re Deportation of Japanese, [1946] 3 D.L.R. 321, [1946] S.C.R. 248; affirmed sub nom. Co-operative Committee on Japanese Canadians et al. v. A.-G. Can., [1947] 1 D.L.R. 577, [1947] A.C. 87. The first group of Orders in Council relates essentially to the person in declaring a protected area and by requiring any person of the Japanese race to leave that area. Those Orders in Council are Order in Council 5295, being the Defence of Canada Regulations (Consolidation) 1941 (ex. 84) which by s. 4 conferred the power to declare a protected area and to control the movement of persons therein; Order in Council 365 (ex. 5) amended s. 4 by allowing the Minister of National Defence and the Minister of Justice to declare the protected area and to require all or any enemy alien to leave; Order in Council 9760 (ex. 6) declared a protected area in all land west of the Cascades, including Saltspring Island, where are situated the lands in question; Order in Council P.C. 1486 [75 Can. Gaz. 3475] (ex. 7) amended the Defence of Canada Regulations (Consolidation) 1941, by authorizing the Minister of Justice to require any or all persons to leave the protected area, and by order of the Minister of Justice of February 26, 1942 (ex. 9), every person of the Japanese race was to leave the protected area forthwith. The second group of Orders in Council relates to the lands in question. Order in Council P.C. 1665 [75 Can. Gaz. 3628] (ex. 10) established a security commission and s. 12 provided that all property situate in the protected area of British Columbia belonging to any person of the Japanese race and resident in such area should be vested in and subject to the control and management of the Custodian. Order in Council P.C. 2483 [Proclamations \u0026amp; Orders in Council, vol. 6, p. 252] (ex. 11) amended Order in Council P.C. 1665 [75 Can. Gaz. 3628] by defining a person of the Japanese race as follows: \u0026ldquo;Person of the Japanese race\u0026rdquo; means any person of the Japanese race required to leave any protected area of British Columbia by Order of the Minister of Justice under Regulation 4, as amended, of the Defence of Canada Regulations (Consolidation) 1941. and by repealing s. 12 and substituting therefor the following: 12(1) Subject as hereinafter in this Regulation provided, as a protective measure only, all property situated in any protected area of British Columbia belonging to any person of the Japanese race (excepting fishing vessels subject to Order in Council P.C. 288 of January 13th, 1942, and deposits of money, shares of stock, debentures, bonds or other securities) delivered up to any person by the owner pursuant to an order of the Minister of Justice, or which is turned over to the Custodian by or on behalf of the owner, or which the owner, on being evacuated from the protected area, is unable to take with him, shall be vested in and subject to the control and management of the Custodian as defined in the Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy, (1939); provided, however, that no commission shall be charged by the Custodian in respect of such control and management. (2) The Custodian may, notwithstanding anything contained in this Regulation, order that all or any property whatsoever, situated in any protected area of British Columbia, belonging to any person of the Japanese race shall, for the purpose of protecting the interests of the owner or any other person, be vested in the Custodian, and the Custodian shall have full power to administer such property for the benefit of all such interested persons, and shall release such property upon being satisfied that the interests aforesaid will not be prejudiced thereby. (3) For the purposes of the control and management of such property by the Custodian, the Consolidated Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy, (1939) shall apply mutatis mutandis to the same extent as if the property belonged to an enemy within the meaning of the said Consolidated Regulations. The Consolidated Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy (1939) (ex. 83), which are incorporated by reference by s. 12(3), defines Custodian by s. 23(1), vests the property of the enemy in the Custodian, and by s. 24 (2) provides: This regulation shall be a vesting order and shall confer upon the Custodian all the rights of the original enemy holder, including the power of sale, management and otherwise dealing with such property rights and interests as he may in his sole discretion decide. Additional powers of the Custodian are conferred by ss. 36 to 40 inclusive and 43 to 46 inclusive. Order in Council P.C. 469 [[1943] 1 C.W.O.R. 224] (ex. 21) empowered the Custodian to sell property of persons of the Japanese race. Section 12(3) of Order in Council 2483 adopts by reference Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy (1939). Consolidated Regulations under Order in Council P.C. 3959 [74 Can. Gaz. 757] (ex. 95) were in force and applied initially to the Custodian. On November 13, 1943, Revised Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy (1943) [P.C. 8526, [1943] 4 C.W.O.R. 713] (ex. 28), were substituted and the former Regulations were repealed. The facts follow. The suppliant was born in Japan of parents who were also born in Japan (examination for discovery, Qq. 5 to 10 inclusive) and was naturalized as shown by Certificate of Canada Citizenship dated June 19, 1951 (ex. 82). On April 5, 1942 (ex. 12) the suppliant, pursuant to the notice (ex. 9) did register as a person of the Japanese race. The suppliant was subsequently evacuated and moved to Greenwood, British Columbia (letter of his solicitor of September 17, 1942 (ex. 19)), and on May 23, 1943, the Custodian filed in the Land Registry Office in the City of Victoria a certificate of vesting of the suppliant\u0026rsquo;s land (ex. 24). In 1944 the Custodian issued a catalogue (ex. 29) of real properties for sale by public tender which included the lands of the suppliant on Saltspring Island, and this catalogue states: Persons interested in the purchase of any of the properties listed herein are asked to contact the agent whose name is set opposite each property. These agents will be pleased to supply additional information and to arrange for the inspection of the property. Also the catalogue referred interested parties for property on Saltspring Island, B.C., to Gavin C. Mouat of Ganges, B.C., described as an agent. The Custodian received offers from Captain Smith (ex. 30) and Salt Spring Lands Limited (ex. 31) to which the Custodian replied, saying that he required an independent valuation. The Custodian also received a third tender from one Bush (ex. 32) which was refused as filed too late. D. K. Wilson, the evaluator of the Custodian, reported the value of the land at $5,000 (ex. 33) and the Custodian thereupon wrote Smith (ex. 34) and Salt Spring Lands Ltd. (ex. 35) that he would not consider any offer of less than $5,000. Subsequently Salt Spring Lands Ltd. offered to purchase at $5,250 and that offer, being the highest, was ultimately accepted (exs. 36, 38, 39 and 40). By deed of March 1, 1945, the Custodian conveyed to Salt Spring Lands Ltd. (exs. 45 and 46). Having received the purchase-money (exs. 47 and 48) the Custodian, on May 23, 1945, accounted to the suppliant (ex. 51). By Order in Council 1810 of July 14, 1947 (ex. 58), it is recited that persons of the Japanese race were evacuated and claims have been made that they suffered pecuniary loss and therefore it was deemed advisable to appoint a commissioner to investigate the claims and to make recommendations. H. I. Bird, then Justice of the Appeal Court, later the Chief Justice of British Columbia, was appointed commissioner. By letter of May 23, 1945 (ex. 51), to the suppliant, the Custodian reported the sale of the land at $5,250 and reported the balance of $4,838.54 standing to the suppliant\u0026rsquo;s credit. By letter of August 19, 1947 (ex. 60), the suppliant objected to the sale of his property, and by letter of August 28, 1947 (ex. 61), the Custodian remitted the balance standing to the credit of the suppliant and reported to him that Mr. Justice Bird had been appointed as commissioner to investigate certain claims of persons of the Japanese race evacuated from British Columbia. Cheques were enclosed by letters of October 5, 1948 (exs. 66 and 67). Subsequently the suppliant was notified of the date of the hearing before the commissioner (ex. 63), and the suppliant gave evidence before the commissioner (ex. 86) and was there represented by counsel (ex. 62). The commissioner reported (ex. 72) as follows: I have the honour to report upon the investigation into claims of persons of the Japanese race made by me pursuant to the terms of Order-in-Council P.C. 1810 of July 18th, 1947, as subsequently amended. Subsequently a policy of liquidation of the property of these evacuated persons was laid down by Order-in-Council P.C. 469 of January 19th, 1943. This policy was put into operation soon after, and on March 8th, 1943, two Advisory Committees were set up by the Custodian to advise the Director upon the disposition or effective use of real and personal property of evacuated persons of the Japanese race then vested in the Custodian. The first of these Committees was appointed for the Greater Vancouver area, the personnel of which comprised The Honourable Mr. Justice Sidney Smith, Justice of Appeal, British Columbia, as Chairman; Charles Jones, Esquire (then Alderman of the City of Vancouver and later Mayor); and K. Kimura, Esquire. The other Advisory Committee, known as the Rural Property Committee, had jurisdiction over all vested property situate outside the Greater Vancouver area, including Prince Rupert and the vicinity, Victoria and elsewhere on Vancouver Island, as well as the Fraser Valley. This Committee was composed of His Honour the late Judge David Whiteside, deceased, as Chairman; D. E. McKenzie, Esquire, New Westminster; Hal Menzies, Esquire, Haney, B.C., and J. J. McLellan, Esquire. Mr. McLellan resigned soon after his appointment and was replaced by William Mott, Esquire, Mayor of New Westminster. The personnel of these Advisory Committees was such as to provide complete assurance that the administration and liquidation of the property of evacuated persons under their auspices would be performed with competence and just consideration for the interests of the owners. I am satisfied on the evidence adduced before me that the very onerous task imposed upon the Director of the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s office at Vancouver, under the guidance and with the assistance of the Advisory Committees, was competently performed, with due regard to the interest of the owners of such property, notwithstanding that the task had to be performed in an atmosphere of public hysteria induced by war. The fact that I have found that in certain respects fair market value was not realized on sales made by the Custodian in no sense reflects upon the work of the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s organization. On the contrary, the evidence brought out on this Inquiry strongly supports the conclusion that this organization, in spite of the magnitude of the responsibilities imposed upon it, has substantially succeeded in administering and subsequently selling property of evacuated persons with due regard to the owner\u0026rsquo;s interest. These Committees advised the Director in respect to all matters arising in connection with the administration and sale of real and personal property under their jurisdiction, including the disposal of all property vested in the Custodian under the Orders-in-Council before mentioned, the methods to be adopted in appraisal of such property, the offering of the same for sale, the prices which should be realized, and the terms of contracts for sale, as well as the leasing of lands the immediate sale of which was considered inadvisable by the Committees. Dealing now with Group 2 above, being real property situate in rural areas other than those included in numbers 1 and 3: The parcels included in this group, as before noted, were widely distributed throughout the Province of British Columbia. Consequently, the Director of the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s office in many instances was unable to obtain the assistance of appraisers with such outstanding qualifications as those who were retained to act in the urban area of Greater Vancouver, nor does it appear that the appraisers employed had the intimate knowledge of the properties appraised which was enjoyed by those retained in the urban area. Moreover, the Rural Advisory Committee, drawn largely from residents of the Fraser Valley, could not bring to their deliberations the same intimate knowledge of properties dealt with by them as was possible in the case of the Urban Committee. I have directed attention earlier to the fact that the Rural Advisory Committee found it necessary to adopt in all circumstances the price fixed by the appraisers. Furthermore, the market for real properties passed upon by the Rural Advisory Committee was a much more limited market than that available in the Greater Vancouver area. The evidence satisfies me that all reasonable efforts were made by the Director of the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s office, as well as the Rural Advisory Committee, to realize the fair market value on the sale of those properties. However, it is my conclusion that the circumstances before outlined did not permit of that realization to the same degree as in the case of properties in the Greater Vancouver area. and further reported his conclusions (ex. 74): Counsel for the claimant caused an appraisal to be made in June, 1949, by R. M. Hall, of Pemberton Homes, Ltd., Victoria, B.C. This appraisal shows that a cruise of the timber on this parcel was made in 1921 by Ryan, Hibbertson, Ltd., who estimated the timber stand to comprise 4,335,000 ft. Claimant sold part of this timber on a stumpage contract made in 1939, at $2.00 per M. The logging contractors took out, in the period 1940 to 1944, approximately 1,250,000 ft. Hall estimates that from 3,000,000 to 3,500,000 ft. remained on the property at the date of sale, which then had a stumpage value of about $4.00 per M., i.e., that there was a value in timber alone of from $12,000 to $14,000. Hall describes the sea frontage to a depth \u0026ldquo;of approximately 300 ft. as being exceptionally valuable for building sites. He considers that this part of the land, comprising approximately 100 acres, could have been sold, if subdivided and road connection furnished, at about $5,000, i.e., minimum $50.00 per acre. He appraises the property as at March, 1945 (the date of sale) at $12,000.00.\u0026rdquo; Mr. Hall\u0026rsquo;s estimate of the value of 100 acres having waterfrontage, i.e., about $5,000, taken into consideration along with the value of timber as well as the remaining 400 acres of wild land lying back of the water frontage mentioned, in my opinion supports the conclusion that the property at the date of sale had a fair market value of not less than $12,000.00. Since the property was sold by the Custodian at $5,250.00 I recommend payment to the claimant of the sum of $6,750.00, to which should be added any charges deducted by the Custodian from the purchase price paid to the claimant. The commissioner found that although the land had been valued at $5,000, yet the fair market value was $12,000, and therefore he recommended that payment of the excess of $6,750 be made. That amount was eventually paid to the suppliant pursuant to his release under seal dated October 28, 1950, whereby the suppliant purported to release His Majesty the King and the Custodian from all actions, claims and demands; the additional sum was paid to the suppliant or to his order (exs. 78, 79 and 80). Subsequently these proceedings were commenced by petition of right. The suppliant alleges in the petition of right: I. A Trust \u0026mdash; The Secretary of State, the Custodian, took custody in trust for and in the interest of the suppliant; II. A Breach \u0026mdash; The lands were vested in the Custodian and sold and conveyed by him to Salt Spring Lands Ltd. III. That such breach imposed liability on the Crown. The prayer for relief (cl. G) asks: (a) That the Crown return the lands or (b) alternatively, pay damages of $1,500,000. The declarations preceding cl. G are merely ancillary to the allegations and relief in cl. G. As to the prayer for return of the lands the suppliant cannot succeed on the suppliant\u0026rsquo;s own pleading. The return of the lands involves more than a simple action in ejectment, but involves also rescission of the title issued to the Custodian and any subsequent title, also, the certificate of vesting (ex. 24) and the deed from the Custodian to Salt Spring Lands Ltd. The remedy of rescission is a remedy to be obtained in equity (Richards v. Collins (1912), 9 D.L.R. 249 at p. 254, 27 O.L.R. 390 at p. 398, excepting the Ontario statutes not here applicable) and in equity a decree will not be made in the absence of a person who will be affected thereby. In Tryon v. Peer (1867), 13 Gr. 311, VanKoughnet, C, at p. 316 stated: \u0026ldquo;It is a general rule that all parties interested in the subject matter of a suit should be before the Court \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; In Best v. Beatty, Calvert v. Beatty (1920), 53 D.L.R. 44, 47 O.L.R. 265 [revd in the result 58 D.L.R. 552, 61 S.C.R. 576], Masten, J., at p. 51 D.L.R., p. 273 O.L.R. stated: Upon this ground it is that in all actions by persons claiming under a trust, the trustee or other person in whom the legal estate is vested is required to be a party to the proceeding; and the rule is the same whether the trust be expressed or only implied. (quoting from Daniell\u0026rsquo;s Chancery Practice, 8th ed., pp. 151-2). Moreover, under the rule audi alteram partem, all such parties must be given an opportunity to plead and to present their case: Manning v. Gieschen and Royal Printers \u0026amp; Stationers Ltd. (1965), 55 D.L.R. (2d) 280, 56 W.W.R. 124; S. A. de Smith on Judicial Review of Administrative Action (1959), p. 103. In the absence of such necessary parties as the Salt Spring Lands Ltd. and the present holder of the legal title, no decree for rescission can be made. It cannot be assumed that such persons could have no answer to this remedy, by election to affirm as in Clough v. London \u0026amp; North Western Railway Co. (1871), L.R. 7 Ex. 26 at p. 34; Barron v. Kelly, 41 D.L.R. 590, 56 S.C.R. 455, [1918] 2 W.W.R. 131, or by laches as in Lagunas Nitrate Co. v. Lagunas Syndicate, [1899] 2 Ch. 392. The alternative remedy to rescission is account. The obligation to account depends upon a trust. Where there is a trust there is the obligation to account; where no trust, there is no obligation to account. In Civilian War Claimants Ass\u0026rsquo;n, Ltd. v. The King, [1932] A.C. 14, Lord Buckmaster at p. 24 stated: Finally, when the moneys were received, it is said that from and after that moment the Crown became a trustee. I have pointed out in the course of the argument, and I repeat, that if that were the case, unless you are going to limit the rights which the beneficiaries enjoy, those rights must include, among other things, a claim for an account of the moneys that were received, of the expenses incurred, and the way in which the moneys have been distributed. Such a claim presented against the Crown in circumstances such as these would certainly have no precedent, and would, as it appears to me, invade an area which is properly that belonging to the House of Commons. In Barnes v. Addy (1874), L.R. 9 Ch. 244 and in Mara v. Browne, [1896] 1 Ch. D. 199, the evidence was not sufficient to make the defendants trustees, therefore the suit was dismissed. In Barnes v. Addy, supra, Lord Selborne, L.C., at pp. 251-2 stated: Now in this case we have to deal with certain persons who are trustees, and with certain other persons who are not trustees. That is a distinction to be borne in mind throughout the case. Those who create a trust clothe the trustee with a legal power and control over the trust property, imposing on him a corresponding responsibility. That responsibility may no doubt be extended in equity to others who are not properly trustees, if they are found either making themselves trustees de son tort, or actually participating in any fraudulent conduct of the trustee to the injury of the cestui que trust. But, on the other hand, strangers are not to be made constructive trustees merely because they act as the agents of trustees in transactions within their legal powers, transactions, perhaps of which a Court of Equity may disapprove, unless those agents receive and become chargeable with some part of the trust property, or unless they assist with knowledge in a dishonest and fraudulent design on the part of the trustees. Those are the principles, as it seems to me, which we must bear in mind in dealing with the facts of this case. If those principles were disregarded, I know not how any one could, in transactions admitting of doubt as to the view which a Court of Equity might take of them, safely discharge the office of solicitor, of banker, or of agent of any sort to trustees. Equity does not give damages: Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Co. (1878), 3 App. Cas. 1218, except where provided by Lord Cairns Act, 1858 (U.K.), c. 27, s. 2, in lieu of injunction or specific performance and that is not this case. However, this suppliant alleges a trust and breach thereof as the basis of his petition, hence the claim for damages may be read as a claim for the personal remedy of account as the remedy arising out of a trust. The pleadings may be taken to allege: I. A trust in the Custodian to the suppliant under Orders in Council 1665 and 2483. II. The breach thereof in part by reason that Order in Council 469 authorizing a sale is alleged ultra vires, therefore there was a breach in the trustee having sold and conveyed to Salt Spring Lands Ltd. III. For such breach the Crown is responsible in account.\nThose allegations have not been made good. I. The suppliant contends that the lands vested in the Custodian as trustee and that trust is inferred under the following circumstances\nThe suppliant contends that the trust arises because any vesting under Orders in Council 1665 and 2483 is subject to the provisions of s. 12 (P.C. 2483) (ex. 11) which provide that the vesting is \u0026ldquo;as a protective measure only\u0026rdquo; and limited to \u0026ldquo;the control and management of the Custodian\u0026rdquo; [s-s. (1)] and \u0026ldquo;for the purpose of protecting the interests of the owner or other person\u0026rdquo; (s. 12(2)) and to administer \u0026ldquo;for the benefit of all such interested persons and shall release such property upon being satisfied that the interests aforesaid will not be prejudiced thereby\u0026rdquo; (s. 12 (2)). \u0026ldquo;For the purpose of control and management\u0026rdquo; the Consolidated Regulations are made applicable (s. 12(3)). In Nakashima v. The King, [1947] 4 D.L.R. 487, [1947] Ex. C.R. 486, Thorson, P., at pp. 494-5 D.L.R., p. 494 Ex. C.R. points out the discretionary powers given to the Custodian under the Consolidated Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy (1939) (Order in Council P.C. 3959 [74 Can. Gaz. 757]) (ex. 95). By s. 21(2) he may deal with the interest of the enemy; by s. 23 he may have the property transferred to his name; by s. 38 he may liquidate; by s. 40 he may dispose of the property publicly or privately. Further by s. 49 the property is free from attachment or execution; by s. 50 the Custodian is not liable for any charge; by ss. 42 to 44 he may set up an office and engage a staff, have full control over his funds and may deposit in any bank and may pay office expenses therefrom. Those powers, and particularly the discretionary powers of the Custodian are inconsistent with any trust. Again, in referring to the alleged limitations, \u0026ldquo;as a protective measure only\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;to the control and management of the Custodian\u0026rdquo;, which the suppliant alleges limit the application of the Consolidated Regulations, Thorson, P., in the Nakashima case states at p. 497 D.L.R., pp. 496-7 Ex. C.R.: In my opinion, even if this were conceded, it would not alter the character of the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s powers and duties. His discretionary powers might be more limited in scope than in the case of alien enemy property, but the difference would be one of degree rather than of kind. He would still have very wide free discretionary powers in the field of control and management. And if P.C. 469 is valid, there would be no difference at all in the scope of the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s discretionary powers as between alien enemy property on the one hand and Japanese evacuee property on the other. and Thorson, P., thereafter stated that Order in Council 469 was valid, in the following words (p. 504 D.L.R., p. 504 Ex. C.R.): It was, therefore, within the power of the Governor in Council to pass P.C. 469 embodying the terms against which the suppliants protest and they were validly enacted. The Custodian has, therefore, the lawful right to liquidate, sell, or otherwise dispose of the property vested in him, including the properties of the suppliants. It therefore follows that the Custodian is under no trust in favour of an alien enemy, but all the rights and powers of the alien enemy in the property are vested in the Custodian, and the Custodian is in the same position with reference to evacuee property. The Nakashima case refers to Consolidated Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy (1939) contained in Order in Council 3959 of August 21, 1940 (ex. 95). Those Regulations were cancelled on November 13, 1943, and Revised Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy (1943) [P.C. 8526, [1943] 4 C.W.O.R. 713] were substituted therefor (ex. 28), but these Revised Regulations (1943) have not lessened the powers of the Custodian in that the equivalent sections are included sometimes under different numbers. The Custodian is vested with the property (s. 21(1)) and all the rights of the enemy (here evacuee) (s. 21(2) and s. 22), with power of sale (ss. 38, 40(1)), with discretion to release (s. 39) and to deal with property (ss. 21(2), 38, 39); vested property is excepted from attachment (s. 49); the Custodian is not liable for charge or tax (s. 50) and may deduct his charges (s. 44). There appears to be no material lessening of the powers of the Custodian by the Revised Regulations (1943) and hence it is immaterial whether there is applicable to the Custodian the Consolidated Regulations, P.C. 3959, referred to in the Nakashima case or the Revised Regulations (1943). Both depend upon the War Measures Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 206, s. 3(2) and hence are conditioned that once the Governor in Council has considered \u0026ldquo;that the Order is necessary or advisable for any of the purposes mentioned that is the end of the matter\u0026rdquo;: Nakashima case, p. 504 D.L.R., p. 504 Ex.

Suffice it to say that it is a narrow strip of land 8 ft. wide by 105 ft. deep running between the residential property of the respondents to the south and the business premises of the appellants to the north. The most easterly 41 ft. of the strip running back from the street line is a stone driveway. Extending westward from the driveway is a grassy area running up to a frame garage owned by the respondents and located at the rear of the strip. A concrete walk-way adjacent to the appellants’ store runs up the side of the store alongside the stone driveway to a set of steps which lead up to a concrete landing giving access to an apartment located over the store. To the west of the steps and concrete landing is an entrance door to an addition which was built on to the rear of the store in 1949 by the appellants’ predecessors in title.\nThe chain of title # The appellants’ and the respondents’ properties were initially owned by one Martin Cloy. In 1918 Mr. Cloy conveyed the property now owned by the respondents to one Elzear Lynch together with a right of way of ingress and egress over a portion of his own property, the strip of land in issue on this appeal. In each subsequent conveyance of that property, including the conveyance made in July of 1957 to the respondents, the right of way over the appellants’ land was granted.\nWhen Mr. Cloy died in July of 1921, the land he had retained, now owned by the appellants, passed to his widow Maude Cloy who was also his executrix. As executrix she conveyed it to herself as devisee under the will but inadvertently included in the conveyance the lands already conveyed by her husband to Mr. Lynch. To rectify this error Mrs. Cloy made a new deed to Mrs. Lynch, who had acquired the land on her husband’s death, and this deed made in April of 1926, included the grant of right of way over the strip of Mrs. Cloy’s land. In November of 1952, Mrs. Cloy transferred her land to her son Douglas Cloy and again through inadvertence omitted to make that conveyance subject to the right of way in favour of Mrs. Lynch. Douglas Cloy remedied this in March of 1958 by a quitclaim deed in favour of the respondents who by that time had become the owners of the adjoining land. In August of 1972, when Douglas Cloy sold his property to the appellants’ predecessors in title, he made the grant subject to the respondents’ right of way and, when they in turn sold it to the appellants in February, 1973, they likewise made their grant subject to the respondents’ right of way.\nIt is accordingly clear, so far as the chain of title to the respective properties is concerned, that the respondents took their property in 1973 subject to the right of way of the appellants over the strip of land in issue on this appeal and the appellants obtained their right of way down through the chain of title to their own property but also by express grant in Douglas Cloy’s quitclaim deed made in March of 1958.\nThe conduct of the owners # The learned trial Judge made a number of important findings with respect to the use of the strip of land made over the years by the owners of the two adjoining properties.\n(a) The respondents and their predecessors in title. Since the respondents’ property has always been used as a dwelling-house, the main use of the strip made by the owners of that property has been as a driveway. Up until about 1956, the respondents’ car was kept in the garage but since that time the garage has been used as a storage shed and the car has been left on the driveway at night. Although the respondent Mr. Keefer uses the car to go back and forth to work, it is also sometimes parked in the driveway during the day and so occasionally are the cars belonging to the respondents’ friends when they come to visit. The trial Judge found that in the 1960s a disabled car was left at the rear of the driveway for some four years.\nThe trial Judge found also that the Keefers on several occasions had put gravel on the driveway at their own expense. They also kept it free of snow in the winter-time. This may not be significant since they have a right of way over it and the Cloys closed down the store every winter and went to Florida.\nAs far as the grassy area to the west of the stone driveway is concerned, the evidence disclosed that the grass had for many years been tended by the owners of the respondents’ property, including the respondents themselves, and that the respondents occasionally held barbecues and picnics on it with no objection from the Cloys. The evidence that the Keefers made a skating-rink of part of the grassy area on three winters does not appear to be significant since it was when the Cloys were wintering in Florida. The evidence, however, that no objection was made by Mr. Cloy when in 1952 Mr. Keefer moved the garage located at the rear of his property over onto the rear of the strip in order to line it up with the driveway is clearly significant.\n(b) The appellants and their predecessors in title. The appellants’ premises have always been used for business purposes, first in Martin Cloy’s time as a grocery store and later by Douglas Cloy as a marine supply store for vessels plying up and down the Welland Canal. Since 1972, when Douglas Cloy sold the property to the respondents’ predecessors in title, it has been used as a general variety store. Douglas Cloy was assisting his father in the business prior to the conveyance to Elzear Lynch and gave evidence on behalf of the appellants as to the use made by his parents and himself of the property from 1918 to 1972. The Cloys never lived on this property.\nThe strip of land was used by the Cloys in the early days to give access to an ice-house at the rear of the store. The ice-house was filled in the winter with blocks of ice cut from the Welland Canal. Deliveries were made from it originally by means of a horse and wagon and later by truck. In 1949 the ice-house was removed and a one-storey addition was built on to the rear of the store. The addition was used partly as an office and partly for the storage of soft drinks. Access to the addition was through a door to the west of the stone steps and landing which provided access to the apartment over the store. Soft drinks were delivered by truck to the storeroom. If there was a car parked in the driveway, the soft drinks would be taken by a small hand-cart; if the driveway was clear, the truck would drive up to the entrance door to make its deliveries.\nMr. Cloy testified that he never parked his car in the driveway but that trucks parked there occasionally when unloading supplies if the driveway was clear. Mr. Cloy’s customers also sometimes parked in the driveway for short periods of time when making purchases.\nThe tenants of the apartment above the store entered from the street by the concrete walk-way running alongside the driveway, but the one tenant who owned a car did not leave his car in the driveway. Moving trucks used the driveway and, when tenants were moving in or out, the Keefers always moved their car if it happened to be in the driveway at the time. The owners used the walk-way to visit the apartment. They also used a portion of the grassy area to get to and from the side entrance to the storage and office premises built on to the rear of the store in 1949.\nMr. Cloy testified that both he and his father had put gravel on the driveway over the years, but he acknowledged that the last time he had put gravel on was probably in 1956. Because of the store’s being closed in the winters from December to March every year when he and his family went to Florida, no trucks or customers’ cars would be parked in the driveway during the winter months. His evidence was that they had been wintering in Florida for the past 18 years.\nThe issue # His Honour Judge Nicholls, after reviewing the evidence of user by both owners over the years, stated:\nThe possession [of the plaintiffs and their predecessors in title] was not consistent with the rights accruing from the specific grant of right of way but far exceeded them. Counsel for the plaintiff expressed the opinion that the grant of right of way matured into a possessory title.\nHe also stated:\nThe possession of the plaintiffs and their predecessors in title was open, visible and continuous for far more than the requisite number of years, but the question arises as to whether there was exclusive possession.\nWith all due respect to the learned trial Judge, I believe that the crucial question in this case is whether the respondents’ possession challenged in any way the right of the legal owner to make the use of the property he wished to make of it. This is not a case where the Keefers could be viewed as trespassers on their neighbours’ property so that any act of theirs on the property was a challenge to the constructive possession of the owners. Possession is not adverse to the extent it is referable to a lawful title: Thomas v. Thomas (1855), 2 K. \u0026amp; J. 79 at p. 83, 69 E.R. 701, per Sir William Page Wood, V.-C. The Keefers were on their neighbours’ property pursuant to their grant of right of way and, even if they exceeded the rights they had by virtue of the right of way, this would not necessarily mean that their right of way matured into a possessory title.\nThe use an owner wants to make of his property may be a limited use and an intermittent or sporadic use. A possessory title cannot, however, be acquired against him by depriving him of uses of his property that he never intended or desired to make of it. The animus possidendi which a person claiming a possessory title must have is an intention to exclude the owner from such uses as the owner wants to make of his property.\nViewed in this light the evidence that the Cloys never parked their car or truck on the strip of land, far from being helpful to the respondents’ case, is harmful to it. It shows that the Cloys never intended or wanted to use the strip for parking. Indeed, this is clear from the fact that they gave the owner of the adjoining property a right of ingress and egress over it. Similarly, the fact that the respondents created a skating-rink on the grassy area in the wintertime when the appellants were in Florida has in my view no real significance in terms of the ouster of the true owner. The true owner was probably quite content to give the Keefers full rein on the property while the store was not in operation. The trial Judge was obviously correct in his finding that, even when the appellants were operating the store, the respondents were using the strip for more than just a means of ingress and egress to their property. I do not believe, however, that this is the test for the acquisition of a possessory title. The test is not whether the respondents exceeded their rights under the right of way but whether they precluded the owner from making the use of the property that he wanted to make of it: Re St. Clair Beach Estates Ltd. v. MacDonald et al. (1974), 5 O.R. (2d) 482, 50 D.L.R. (3d) 650. Acts relied on as dispossessing the true owner must be inconsistent with the form of enjoyment of the property intended by the true owner. This has been held to be the test for adverse possession since the leading case of Leigh v. Jack (1879), 5 Ex.D. 264.\nThe onus of establishing title by possession is on the claimant and it is harder for a claimant to discharge this onus when he is on the property pursuant to a grant from the owner. It was held in Littledale v. Liverpool College, [1900] 1 Ch. 19, that acts done on another’s land may be attributed to the exercise of an easement, even an excessive exercise of an easement, rather than to adverse possession of the fee.\nIn Pflug and Pflug v. Collins, [1952] O.R. 519 at p. 527, [1952] 3 D.L.R. 681 at p. 689 [affirmed [1953] O.W.N. 140, [1953] 1 D.L.R. 841], Mr. Justice Wells (as he then was) made it clear that a person claiming a possessory title must establish (1) actual possession for the statutory period by themselves and those through whom they claim; (2) that such possession was with the intention of excluding from possession the owner or persons entitled to possession; and (3) discontinuance of possession for the statutory period by the owner and all others, if any, entitled to possession. If he fails in any one of these respects, his claim fails.\nIn my view the respondents fail in both (2) and (3) above. I do not believe that while the Cloys owned the strip of property in issue the Keefers ever intended to oust them from the limited use they wanted to make of it. The evidence discloses that the relationship between the Cloys and the Keefers was excellent and that there never was any trouble with the respondents when delivery trucks occasionally used the driveway for unloading supplies, when customers parked for short periods on the driveway when making purchases at the store, when tenants were moved in and out of the upstairs apartment and when they came and went to the apartment. Nor did Douglas Cloy take any exception to the Keefers parking their car in the driveway. Why would he, even if it were an excessive use of the right of way, if it did not impede him in the use he wanted to make of the property? His whole posture appears to have been that of an accommodating neighbour anxious to avoid any trouble. This is clear from the one contentious incident disclosed by the evidence, i.e., the incident when one of Mr. Cloy’s tenants in the upstairs apartment left his car in the driveway and had a “run-in” with Mr. Keefer. When his tenant reported this to him, Mr. Cloy told him to park somewhere else because “I do not want to fight with my neighbours.”\nThe evidence of Mr. Keefer was “I never had any problems with Doug (Mr. Cloy) as far as the drive-way was concerned.” He testified that on one occasion Mr. Cloy left his car in the driveway overnight so that he was unable to get his car out in the morning. He therefore pushed Mr. Cloy’s car out onto the road and Mr. Cloy apparently made no objection to his having done that. I cannot attach great significance to this as evidencing an assertion of possessory title by the Keefers since the Cloys, having given the Keefers a right of ingress and egress, had no right to block Mr. Keefer’s egress. Mr. Keefer was perfectly entitled to do what he did. I cannot find on the evidence that the Keefers’ possession was with the intention of excluding the Cloys from the limited use they wanted to make of the property. I think that the issue of a possessory title is something that has arisen since the Cloy’s property changed hands and the hitherto amicable relations between the adjoining owners disintegrated.\nAs far as proof of the discontinuance of possession by the owner is concerned, I do not believe that the Cloys did discontinue their possession of any part of the strip of land other than the portion at the rear occupied by the respondents’ garage. I think that with respect to that portion the constructive possession of the owners was displaced by the actual possession of the Keefers for more than the statutory period. However, as far as the balance of the strip is concerned, I think the owners made such use of it as they wanted. It was used as an access to the apartment above the store and to the entrance to the addition at the rear of the store. It is true that the Cloys may not have used the full width of the strip for this purpose, but the authorities make it clear that the constructive possession which a legal owner has of the whole of his property is not ousted simply because he is not in actual possession of the whole. Possession of part is possession of the whole if the possessor is the legal owner: Great Western R. Co. v. Lutz (1881), 32 U.C.C.P. 166. I find, therefore, that the respondents have not discharged the onus of proving discontinuance of possession of the strip (other than the portion occupied by their garage) by the owners for the statutory period.\nI would allow the appeal and hold the respondents entitled to a declaration that the appellants’ title has been extinguished only with respect to that part of the land occupied by the respondents’ garage.\nThe appellants should have their costs of the appeal.\n"},{"id":114,"href":"/casebook/relationships/kosicki/","title":"Kosicki v Toronto (City)","section":"Chapter 1","content":" Sossin J.A. \u0026ndash; # Overview # Can private landowners gain title over municipal parkland through adverse possession? This is the central question raised on this appeal. The application judge answered this question by finding that municipal parkland is immune to adverse possession. While I would not accept such an immunity arises at common law, I conclude the application judge was correct in finding that the municipal parkland at issue in this case was not available for adverse possession. For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.\nThe appellants own a property near the Humber River on the southeast corner of Lundy Avenue and Warren Crescent. There are 26 other residential properties east of the appellants\u0026rsquo; property. The City of Toronto is the registered owner of a strip of land on the south side of these properties (the \u0026ldquo;City Lands\u0026rdquo;). For simplicity, the City Lands can be described as comprising three sections (as represented on the diagram below): i) a laneway that runs along the southern boundary of the properties and which has been used for over 40 years to access the rear-facing garages of the residential properties on Warren Crescent (Part 1 in the diagram below); ii) a trapezoid-like parcel of land behind the appellants\u0026rsquo; single-family house, which has been fenced and used exclusively by the owners of the appellants\u0026rsquo; property since at least 1971 (the \u0026ldquo;Disputed Land\u0026rdquo; identified as Parts 2 and 3 in the diagram below); and iii) a rectangular parcel of land, which the City consented to transfer to the appellants\u0026rsquo; easterly neighbour (Part 4 in the diagram below).\n​\nThe City Lands are adjacent to Étienne Brûlé Park, a park that runs along a section of the Humber River. The City\u0026rsquo;s Official Plan designates this park and the Disputed Land as part of the City\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Green Space System\u0026rdquo;. According to the City, the Green Space System is comprised of those lands that are large and have significant natural heritage or recreational value. In particular, within this system, the Disputed Land is designated as \u0026ldquo;Parks and Open Space Areas\u0026rdquo;, intended to provide public parks and recreational opportunities. It is official City policy to discourage the sale and disposal of lands in the Green Space System, such as the Disputed Land.\nSometime between 1958 and 1971, a fence was erected by the then-owners of the appellants\u0026rsquo; property around the Disputed Land, enclosing it within the backyard of the appellants\u0026rsquo; house. The public has not been able to access the Disputed Land since at least this time.\nThe appellants use the Disputed Land as a play area for their children and maintain it as part of their backyard. The appellants have paid realty taxes on the Disputed Land, and the City accepted those payments until 2020. The appellants approached the City about purchasing the disputed lands in 2021. The City, based on its policy, refused to sell, so the appellants brought a claim for adverse possession.\nDecision Below # The application judge found the appellants\u0026rsquo; claim would have met the threshold for adverse possession, as the Disputed Land was fenced in by the previous owners of the property since at least 1971, with no objection from the City. The previous owners of the appellants' property, as well as the appellants, have maintained undisrupted and exclusive possession of the Disputed Land.\nWhile the facts at hand would have led to ownership arising from adverse possession if the dispute is between private parties, the application judge found that publicly owned land of this kind is immune to claims for adverse possession.\nThe application judge reviewed the history of public ownership of the Disputed Land. In 1958, the City Lands, which include the Disputed Land, were expropriated by the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (the \u0026ldquo;Conservation Authority\u0026rdquo;) as part of a larger stretch of land bordering the Humber River. The application judge found that the City Lands were \u0026ldquo;taken for public use\u0026rdquo; and that \u0026ldquo;\u0026rsquo;expropriation\u0026rsquo; by its very nature is an action for public purposes.\u0026rdquo;\nThe application judge found that, in 1971, these City Lands were conveyed by the Conservation Authority to the City for a nominal sum of $2.00. One of the components of the City Lands, the public laneway, allowed access for the residents\u0026rsquo; rear-facing garages. The application judge reviewed the record with respect to the Disputed Land after the conveyance and concluded, at para. 54:\n[54] Until this application seeking an adverse possession claim, there was no evidence that the City was aware of the lands being public; nor that any city funds have been expended to maintain the disputed lands. It stands to reason that this was, in part, because the applicants' predecessors had fenced off and excluded the land from the public.\nThe application judge characterized the property owners' extended fencing of the parkland as a deprivation of a reasonable use of the Disputed Land by the public. The application judge found that the Disputed Land could be put to use for the public benefit. The Disputed Land is part of a public park, and the City has plans to turn it into an access point to Étienne Brûlé park and the 29-kilometre Humber River Recreational Trail. She found that for over 50 years, \u0026ldquo;the property owners encroached on public lands with fencing to exclude public use. By their actions, they significantly narrowed the very access area to the public park.\u0026rdquo;\nThe application judge concluded that public parkland is immune to claims for adverse possession. She found that \u0026ldquo;a private individual must not be able to acquire title by encroaching on public lands and fencing off portions for their private use in the manner of two private property owners\u0026rdquo;. The lands were originally required for a \u0026ldquo;very high public interest\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash; they were expropriated for a public purpose and conveyed to the City as parkland. If allowed, the application judge reasoned, this would set a \u0026ldquo;dangerous precedent\u0026rdquo;.\nAnalysis # The sole issue on this appeal is whether the application judge erred in finding that the appellants could not succeed in their claim for adverse possession over the Disputed Land. To resolve this issue, I must consider two questions: first, whether the application judge applied the proper adverse possession analysis to the facts of this case; second, whether the Real Property Limitations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15 (\u0026quot;RPLA\u0026quot;) affects this analysis, and specifically whether, as the appellants argue, the operation of the RPLA supersedes the common law and governs this dispute.\n(1) The Common Law Scheme for Adverse Possession Claims # In Nelson (City) v. Mowatt 2017 SCC 8, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 138, at para. 17, Brown J. describes the common law basis for adverse possession as follows:\nAdverse possession is a long-standing common law device by which the right of the prior possessor of land, typically the holder of registered title and therefore sometimes referred to as the \u0026ldquo;true owner\u0026rdquo;, may be displaced by a trespasser whose possession of the land goes unchallenged for a prescribed period of time. From as early as The Limitation Act, 1623 (Eng.), 21 Jas. 1, c. 16, the prior possessor\u0026rsquo;s right to recover possession was curtailed by limitation periods.\nAdverse possession at common law is established where the claimant had (i) actual, open, notorious, constant, continuous and peaceful possession of the subject land for the statutory period of 10 years; (ii) an intention to exclude the true owner from possession; and (iii) effective exclusion of the true owner for the entire 10-year statutory period: Billimoria v. Mistry 2022 ONCA 276, 470 D.L.R. (4th) 406, at para. 27, citing Vivekanandan v. Terzian 2020 ONCA 110, 443 D.L.R. (4th) 678, at para. 21.\nCanadian courts have treated adverse possession in the context of public lands at common law as distinct. In part, this is because the common law rationales for adverse possession between two private parties do not apply to publicly owned property.\nScholars have posited three rationales at common law for adverse possession between private parties. First, the doctrine of adverse possession penalizes landowners who \u0026ldquo;sleep on their rights\u0026rdquo; and rewards the \u0026ldquo;working possessor\u0026rdquo; \u0026mdash; the \u0026ldquo;reward-penalty\u0026rdquo; explanation. Second, based on similar reasoning, the doctrine encourages land to be put to its best, or most productive, use. Third, the doctrine encourages property owners to monitor their property and resolve any boundary, title, or other disputes, expeditiously, and in doing so, \u0026ldquo;protects the settled expectations of an adverse possessor who has acted on the assumption that her occupation will not be disturbed\u0026rdquo;: see Bruce Ziff, Principles of Property Law, 6th ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 2014), at pp. 141-45. See also Jeffrey E. Stake, \u0026ldquo;The Uneasy Case for Adverse Possession\u0026rdquo; (2001) 89 Geo L.J. 2419. None of these rationales have application against a municipal parkland.\nFirst, a municipal authority which allocates land-use according to statute cannot be said to \u0026ldquo;sleep on its rights\u0026rdquo; in relation to land designated as parkland, or for conservation or as an open space.\nSecond, adverse possession cannot be said to result in better uses of land than those pursued by public authorities. As reflected in municipal zoning laws, there is an important public interest in the allocation of land for different uses, including land for transportation and industry, land for residential development and land for parkland, conservation or open spaces.\nThird, it is not realistic to expect a municipality to monitor the entirety of its land for signs of encroachment. As the application judge in this case observed, at para. 74, \u0026ldquo;The City is simply unable to patrol all its lands against such adverse possessors. The courts cannot demand the same vigilance of a private landowner to watch its borders of a public entity.\u0026rdquo; Further, where private parties object to the municipal zoning of particular land for particular uses, there are statutory dispute resolution processes which must be followed. Therefore, the rationale of encouraging monitoring and settling disputes also has little if any application in the context of adverse possession of municipal parkland.\nIndeed, it is difficult to identify any rationale for adverse possession against municipal parkland. However, save where adverse possession of public lands has been barred by statute, the common law has developed analytical approaches that leave open, at least in some circumstances, that adverse possession against such property remains possible.\nIn his chapter on \u0026ldquo;Capacity to Hold and Deal with Interests in Land\u0026rdquo; in Anne Warner La Forest, Anger \u0026amp; Honsberger Law of Real Property, 3rd ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 2006), at §24:10, G. Thomas Johnson summarizes this principle as follows:\nMunicipalities, cities and towns have the power to acquire property by dedication, by devise, and by prescription. A town council which is authorized to expropriate land for specified purposes cannot exercise that power for different purposes. Where legislation has prescribed the mode of acquiring property, any other mode of acquisition is excluded. For example, the power to acquire land for a housing project does not permit a council to acquire shares in the corporation which owns the necessary land.\nThe right of ownership in real property held by a city or town for the common benefit or use of its inhabitants or of the Queen\u0026rsquo;s subjects in general (i.e., a highway) is of such a public character that it cannot, as a general rule, be lost by adverse possession over the prescriptive period. [Footnotes omitted; emphasis added.]\nIn Hughes v. Fredericton (City) 216 N.B.R. (2d) 387, at para. 10, aff\u0026rsquo;d 225 N.B.R. (2d) 264 (C.A.), the court cited the emphasized passage above with approval. The court accepted, at para. 12, that at common law, municipal land zoned as parkland is held in trust for the public, and generally not available for adverse possession:\nI find that the entire portion of the land acquired by the City of Fredericton was zoned for parkland and there was a clear intention that it was acquired for public use. It would be difficult, if not impossible, for a claimant to acquire such land by adverse possession. As soon as the land was zoned for parkland for public use, it was held in trust by the City for the public. [Emphasis added.]\nThe Development of the Public Benefit Test in the Common Law of Adverse Possession in Relation to Public Lands # Faced with the fact-specific analysis of adverse possession in the context of municipal land, where it is generally not available for adverse possession but where no complete bar or immunity is applicable, courts have developed a \u0026ldquo;public benefit\u0026rdquo; test to determine whether the municipal land at issue is immune from adverse possession.\nIn Hackett v. Colchester South (Twp.), [1928] S.C.R. 255, Duff J. stated in obiter remarks he was \u0026ldquo;much impressed\u0026rdquo; by the proposition that lands dedicated to public use and duly accepted by a municipality give rise to rights of enjoyment by the general public. He characterized these rights as \u0026ldquo;closely analogous to the rights of the public in respect of a public highway\u0026rdquo;, and the title of the municipality in such lands should not be capable of being nullified by claims of adverse possession: at p. 256.\nIn light of Colchester, subsequent decisions rejected adverse possession claims against municipal lands, reasoning that it is inconsistent with the \u0026ldquo;high public interest purpose\u0026rdquo; to which those lands were or could be put: Woychyshyn v. Ottawa (City) 2009 88 R.P.R. (4th) 155 (Ont. S.C.), at para. 13, and Prescott \u0026amp; Russell (United Counties) v. Waugh 2004 15 M.P.L.R. (4th) 314 (Ont. S.C.).\nIn Prescott \u0026amp; Russell, Charbonneau J. found that municipal land that had been acquired for public forestry purposes could not be lost by adverse possession any more than the rest of the forest into which that land had been incorporated. Charbonneau J. held, at para. 21:\nWhen a municipality acquires lands for forestry purposes a very high public interest purpose arises as can be seen by the meaning the legislature has ascribed to that expression. It makes eminent sense that, in order to protect this vital public interest and as a matter of public policy, lands held by a municipality in such circumstances cannot be the subject of a claim for adverse possession.\nIn Woychyshyn, at para. 13, Ray J. dismissed a claim for possessory title to municipal parkland registered to the City of Ottawa, reasoning that there is a high public interest in maintaining such lands:\nI have serious doubts that municipally owned land can be subject to a claim for possessory title. The Respondent\u0026rsquo;s evidence included a description of the complex procedures and processes required before municipal property can be disposed of. It suggests there is a high public interest in the preservation of municipal property. It should not be disposed of easily. A loss of property through adverse possession would be contrary to this high public interest.\nIn Oro-Medonte (Township) v. Warkentin, 2013 ONSC 1416, Howden J. found that a lakeshore promenade owned by the Township, but used and maintained in part by owners of lake-front lots, was immune from adverse possession. In reaching this conclusion, Howden J. summarized these earlier precedents and proposed the following test, at para. 119:\n[L]ands held by a municipality other than as public road allowances which meet the following factors are immune from claims of neighbouring landowners based on prescriptive rights or adverse possession:\n(i) the land was purchased by or dedicated to the municipality for the use or benefit of the public, or as here, for the use or benefit of an entire subdivision as well as the public at large; and\n(ii) since its acquisition by the municipality, the land has been used by and of benefit to the public.\nHowden J. set out the rationale underlying the \u0026ldquo;public benefit\u0026rdquo; test. He stated that land acquired by a municipality and used for public purposes should be understood as being held in trust for the benefit of the public, and therefore title over such land cannot be lost or extinguished by reason of ordinary acts or omissions associated with adverse possession. Howden J. found legislative support for this approach in the elaborate processes designated by statute governing when and how municipalities can sell or convey municipal property. He concluded that, given such property is owned by municipality by way of quality title for the public benefit, fairness and justice require that no two people should be able to deprive the public of that benefit.\nThe approach developed in Warkentin to the \u0026ldquo;public benefit\u0026rdquo; test subsequently was adopted in Richard v. Niagara Falls 2018 ONSC 7389 (Ont. S.C.J.), 4 R.P.R. (6th) 238, aff\u0026rsquo;d on other grounds, 2019 ONCA 531. In that case, a claim for adverse possession of municipal land was not made out because the applicants failed to prove that their use of the land was inconsistent with the city\u0026rsquo;s intended use. Henderson J., after citing Warkentin, stated in obiter, at para. 27:\n[I]n order to be immune from such a claim for adverse possession, the municipality must show that the land was purchased or dedicated for the use of the public, and that the land has been used by and of benefit to the public. [Emphasis added.]\nIn Richard, Henderson J. incorporated the \u0026ldquo;public benefit\u0026rdquo; test into the third factor of the test for adverse possession (i.e., whether the city was effectively excluded from possession). I note that this was an incorrect placement of the \u0026ldquo;public benefit\u0026rdquo; test, which is instead a limitation to some claims for adverse possession for public lands. However, I summarize here the approach taken in Richard to clarify the proper characterization of the common law test. In Richard, the court focused on the de facto situation, which in that case was that the city intended to allow the public to make use of the trail in question. While the court referred to the de facto use by the city, as opposed to whether the city had formally designated the disputed land as a park, Henderson J.\u0026rsquo;s formulation of the test introduces the possibility that if a claimant can otherwise meet the threshold for adverse possession \u0026mdash; and there is no evidence the disputed municipal land is actually in use for the public \u0026mdash; an adverse possession claim could succeed. For the reasons elaborated below, I would not accept this characterization of the common law test.\nAs the appellants point out, some adverse possession claims against municipalities involving parkland have succeeded. For example, in Teis v. Ancaster (Town), (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 216 (C.A.), this court dismissed an appeal from a decision granting adverse possession to private landowners over a strip of land and laneway in a public park. The appeal was decided on the common law test of mutual mistake since neither the private landowners nor the municipality had argued different rules applied to the common law of adverse possession in this factual setting. Nonetheless, Laskin J.A., in obiter comments, expressed \u0026ldquo;some discomfort\u0026rdquo; over applying the ordinary rules of adverse possession to municipal parkland, at pp. 228-229:\nMost adverse possession claims involve disputes between private property owners. In this case, the Teises claim adverse possession of municipally owned land. I have some discomfort in upholding a possessory title to land that the Town would otherwise use to extend its public park for the benefit of its residents. Still, the Town did not suggest that municipally owned park land cannot be extinguished by adverse possession or even that different, more stringent requirements must be met when the land in dispute is owned by a municipality and would be used for a public park. This case was argued before the trial judge and in this court on the footing that the ordinary principles of adverse possession law applied. The application of those principles to the evidence and the trial judge\u0026rsquo;s findings of fact justify extinguishing the Town\u0026rsquo;s title to the ploughed strip and the laneway.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nWhether, short of statutory reform, the protection against adverse possession afforded to municipal streets and highways should be extended to municipal land used for public parks, I leave to a case where the parties squarely raise the issue. [Emphasis added.]\nIn my view, Teis stands for the proposition that it is open to a municipality to waive its presumptive title over parkland. While in Teis this was done through agreement that the \u0026ldquo;ordinary\u0026rdquo; rules of adverse possession applied, this waiver may also be accomplished by acknowledging a private landowner\u0026rsquo;s adverse possession and consenting to a transfer of title (as was done with the neighbour\u0026rsquo;s property in this case), or simply by a municipality acquiescing to adverse possession, where it has clear knowledge of its parkland property being adversely possessed by private landowners, and agreeing to take no steps to interfere with that adverse possession.\nAside from those exceptional circumstances, the general rule that municipal parkland is not available for adverse possession has been given expression through the development of the \u0026ldquo;public benefit\u0026rdquo; test as set out above.\nThe appellants argued before the application judge that the Disputed Land does not meet the public benefit standard because it clearly was not in public use over the relevant time period (as it had been fenced off by the previous owners of the property). The application judge accepted this position.\nOn appeal, however, the appellants now argue that the \u0026ldquo;public benefit\u0026rdquo; test has not been endorsed by an appellate court and should be rejected entirely as inconsistent with the RPLA. For the reasons set out below, I do not accept this position.\nFor its part, the City argues that the \u0026ldquo;public benefit\u0026rdquo; test is good law, but that the application judge was incorrect in finding its threshold was not met in this case. The City contends that the Disputed Land was expropriated for public use and private landowners should not be able to defeat that use by fencing off public land for private benefit. According to the City, as held by the application judge, municipal parkland of this kind should be treated as immune from adverse possession.\nI see the proper approach to adverse possession of municipal parkland lying between the two positions of the parties in this appeal. Under this approach, while municipal parkland is generally unavailable for adverse possession, it may become available exceptionally where the municipality has waived its presumptive rights over the property either expressly or by acknowledging or acquiescing to a private landowner\u0026rsquo;s adverse possession of parkland.\nThe Application of the Common Law of Adverse Possession to the Facts of this Case # Applying the \u0026ldquo;public benefit\u0026rdquo; test to the record before her, the application judge concluded that, \u0026ldquo;The City was unable to provide evidence that the land was used by the public sometime in the 13 years after acquisition, before it was fenced out. I find it thereby fails the Public Benefit Test.\u0026rdquo;\nAs elaborated above, the application judge nonetheless held that it would be inappropriate to permit a claim in adverse possession to succeed in circumstances where public lands are fenced off by private individuals, as this would set \u0026ldquo;a dangerous precedent.\u0026rdquo;\nIn my view, the application judge treated as two separate considerations what should be seen as a single question to be addressed by the court in applying the public benefit analysis. Where land is acquired by a municipality and zoned as parkland or a space to be accessible to the public, such land should be treated as presumptively in use for the public benefit unless there is evidence the municipality has acknowledged and acquiesced to its private use. It is not enough to show that the land was rendered in fact unavailable to the public by the actions of private landowners.\nTherefore, in this case, it was not necessary that the City demonstrate the disputed land actually was used specifically for a public benefit during the period prior to it being fenced off (i.e., between 1958 and 1971). Rather, the sole question to be addressed was whether the appellants, in seeking title through adverse possession, could displace this presumption of public benefit to this municipally owned land zoned to be used as parkland \u0026mdash; for example, by showing that, while the Disputed Land was acquired for a public benefit, the municipality, with full knowledge, acknowledged or acquiesced to its use for the benefit of the then-owners of the appellants\u0026rsquo; property.\nOn this point, it is helpful to consider the City\u0026rsquo;s aforementioned consent, in 2013, to an order in favour of the easterly neighbours of the appellants, declaring those neighbours the successful adverse possessor of a rectangular portion of the City Lands abutting the informal laneway. The application judge referred to this consent as undertaken in a \u0026ldquo;cavalier\u0026rdquo; manner. The City indicated in oral submissions that this consent may simply have been an error, based on the mistaken belief that this parcel had been zoned residential when the land fell under the Borough of York. No such consent or acknowledgment by the City, however, has been made in relation to the Disputed Lands at issue in this appeal. Nor can it be said, in light of the application judge\u0026rsquo;s factual findings, that the City acquiesced to the use of the Disputed Land by the appellants or previous owners of this property during the period prior to it being fenced in or afterwards. The evidence was to the contrary, as there is nothing in the record to indicate that the City was aware the fenced off Disputed Land was municipal parkland. By contrast, the appellants were aware that the fenced off land was municipal property and not part of their title, which is why they sought to purchase the property from the City.\nGenerally, if a claimant acknowledges the right of the true owner, then possession will not be adverse. \u0026ldquo;Acknowledgment of title will thus stop the clock from running\u0026rdquo;: McClatchie v. Rideau Lakes (Township) 2015 ONCA 233, 53 R.P.R. (5th) 169, at para. 12, citing Teis, at p. 221, and see also 1043 Bloor Inc. v. 1714104 Ontario Inc. 2013 ONCA 91, 114 O.R. (3d) 241, at para. 73. In this case, however, the relevant time period was not when the appellants sought to purchase the Disputed Land, but rather when the previous owners first fenced it off.\nAnother way of looking at the question is whether the municipal parkland was intended to be, and would have been used for the public benefit, but for interference of the private landowners. Where, as here, this is the case, the party bringing a claim for adverse possession against a municipality will not have met the test to show the land has not been used for a public benefit.\nI take this formulation to be consistent with the view expressed by the application judge in finding that, \u0026ldquo;the private landowner may not proceed to fence off public lands and exclude the public and succeed in a claim for adverse possession.\u0026rdquo; To the extent such a scenario would not meet the \u0026ldquo;public benefit\u0026rdquo; test as set out in Warkentin and Richard, the test was framed too narrowly in those cases.\nTherefore, I would reframe the test for adverse possession of public land developed in cases such as Warkentin and Richard adopted by the application judge, as follows: adverse possession claims which are otherwise made out against municipal land will not succeed where the land was purchased by or dedicated to the municipality for the use or benefit of the public, and the municipality has not waived its presumptive rights over the property, or acknowledged or acquiesced to its use by a private landowner or landowners.\nBased on this reframed test, I conclude the application judge came to the correct result by finding adverse possession at common law was unavailable against the municipal parkland in this case.\n(2) The Statutory Scheme for Adverse Possession Claims # The appellants argue that the application judge\u0026rsquo;s decision deprives them of the protection afforded by ss. 4 and 15 of the RPLA and therefore should be rejected.\nSection 4 of the RPLA reads:\n4. No person shall make an entry or distress, or bring an action to recover any land or rent, but within ten years next after the time at which the right to make such entry or distress, or to bring such action, first accrued to some person through whom the person making or bringing it claims, or if the right did not accrue to any person through whom that person claims, then within ten years next after the time at which the right to make such entry or distress, or to bring such action, first accrued to the person making or bringing it.\nCourts have interpreted s. 4 of the RPLA as clarifying that adverse possession, where established at common law, will give rise to a limitation period of 10 years, after which the party engaging in adverse possession will gain rights over the land.\nSection 15 of the RPLA reads:\n15. At the determination of the period limited by this Act to any person for making an entry or distress or bringing any action, the right and title of such person to the land or rent, for the recovery whereof such entry, distress or action, respectively, might have been made or brought within such period, is extinguished.\nTherefore, where an adverse possessor of land maintains possession of the requisite character for a period of 10 years, s. 4 of the RPLA bars the remedies of the paper title holder with respect to that land and s. 15 of the RPLA extinguishes the \u0026ldquo;true owner\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo; title to that land: see Teis, at para. 8.\nSection 16 of the RPLA contains an exception to the application of these provisions in favour of certain categories of public land, including public highways, and waste or vacant land of the Crown:\n16. Nothing in sections 1 to 15 applies to any waste or vacant land of the Crown, whether surveyed or not, nor to lands included in any road allowance heretofore or hereafter surveyed and laid out or to any lands reserved or set apart or laid out as a public highway where the freehold in any such road allowance or highway is vested in the Crown or in a municipal corporation, commission or other public body, but nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect or prejudice any right, title or interest acquired by any person before the 13th day of June, 1922.\nIt is common ground among the parties that the exception in s. 16 establishing immunity from adverse possession for certain kinds of public land does not extend to municipal parkland such as the Disputed Land. The application judge did not refer to this provision, or to the RPLA at all in her reasons. Although the RPLA was referred to in the materials in the proceeding below, the legislative scheme was not the focus of either party\u0026rsquo;s submissions.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nWhile s. 16 of the RPLA, first enacted in 1922, codified one aspect of this common law rule with respect to certain exemptions from the operation of ss. 4 and 15, in my view, nothing in the RPLA suggests it was intended to preclude the further development of the common law in public lands not of the kind categorized in that provision.\n[Justice Sossin concluded that the RPLA did not act as a \u0026ldquo;complete code\u0026rdquo; to bar application of the common law of adverse possession.]\nFor these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.\nBrown J.A. (dissenting) \u0026ndash; # Parks are good things. Every morning I look out my window and enjoy the sight of the sun rising over the tree canopy of one of Toronto\u0026rsquo;s oldest and largest parks. When at work, I can look out my window and see the residents of a green-space-starved, concretized, downtown Toronto core enjoying the small, construction-free patch of grass that remains of Osgoode Hall\u0026rsquo;s West lawn. Adequate parks are vital to maintaining one\u0026rsquo;s sanity and socializing with one\u0026rsquo;s neighbours in an urban sea of steel and glass. Parks give rise to pleasant thoughts and strong sentiments.\nThat said, a case such as this which involves a claim by homeowners to adverse possession of a small patch of a municipally-owned greenspace that has formed their backyard for decades cannot be decided on the basis of sentiments about parkland. The appellants are entitled to have their case decided in accordance with the governing principles of law. Those principles are set out in statute, the Real Property Limitations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15 (the \u0026ldquo;RPLA\u0026rdquo;).\nThe application judge did not apply those legal principles.\nInstead, she stepped outside the governing statutory regime to consider whether the City of Toronto (the \u0026ldquo;City\u0026rdquo;) enjoyed the benefit of a recent, judge-made exception to the statutory scheme, the so-called \u0026ldquo;Public Benefit Test\u0026rdquo; asserted and articulated by the court in Oro-Medonte (Township) v. Warkentin, 2013 ONSC 1416, 30 R.P.R. (5th) 44. She concluded the City did not. So, the application judge went further. She created an even broader judge-made test that would immunize the Disputed Land from the appellants\u0026rsquo; matured adverse possession claim. The application judge articulated her test as follows: a \u0026ldquo;private landowner may not proceed to fence off public lands and exclude the public and succeed in a claim for adverse possession.\u0026rdquo; Hereafter I shall refer to the rule created by the application judge as the \u0026ldquo;Judicial Public Lands Immunity\u0026rdquo; rule. In my view, by ignoring the RPLA and creating a new judge-made rule, the application judge erred in law. She should have granted the appellants the relief they sought; they were entitled to it under the existing law.\nMy colleagues support the approach taken by the application judge, albeit they tweak her judge-made test a bit. I respectfully but very strongly disagree with my colleagues\u0026rsquo; decision and their analysis. I therefore dissent.\nThe Disputed Land is approximately 340m2 in size: a postage stamp when viewed in the context of the overall size of the adjacent Étienne Brûlé Park, which winds along the Humber River from the Old Mill to just south of Dundas Street West. But the land makes up most of the backyard used by the appellants.\nReasonable people can disagree as to whether, as a matter of public policy, municipal lands, including parkland, should be exposed to adverse possession claims regardless of the strength of the claim \u0026mdash; here, there is no dispute the appellants have satisfied the statutory requirements to extinguish the City\u0026rsquo;s title to the Disputed Land \u0026mdash; or the size of the lands affected. However, the appellants are entitled to have their claim decided not on the basis of what some judges might wish the law to be, but on the basis of what the law is.\nStatute\u0026ndash;the RPLA\u0026ndash;sets out the requirements for establishing adverse possession in Ontario. Applying the law as it now is, the appellants succeed on their claim. There is no dispute about this fact. Yet, the application judge and my colleagues have denied the appellants\u0026rsquo; claim on the basis that courts are entitled to look beyond the law as it is and, instead, determine the claim based on the law as the courts think it ought to be. They have pushed the RPLA aside in order to create a legal rule, not found in the statute, about what type of land should be immune from claims for adverse possession. In my respectful view, their arrogation of such rule-making power constitutes legal error.\nAs I understand my colleagues\u0026rsquo; reasons, the key difference that separates our views is this: my colleagues take the view that common law principles continue to govern the law of adverse possession; by contrast, I read the history of that law as disclosing that a statutory codification and reformation of the law in the area took place almost two hundred years ago, a view that I think is supported by the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Nelson (City) v. Mowatt 2017 SCC 8, [2017] 1 S.C.R. 138, at para. 17.\nAs a result of those different views, my colleagues think it open to a judge to create new legal rules regarding adverse possession, including exempting lands from the operation of adverse possession, notwithstanding the narrow list of exempt lands set out in RPLA s. 16: waste or vacant Crown land, and road allowances and highways on Crown and municipal land. On my part, I think the RPLA acts as a comprehensive code of the principles of adverse possession subject, of course, to proper statutory interpretation. The courts certainly continue to possess the power to interpret and apply the provisions of the RPLA. Indeed, a large body of case law has developed around the interpretation of the statutory terms \u0026ldquo;possession\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;dispossession\u0026rdquo; that lie at the heart of the RPLA. However, I do not regard proper statutory interpretation as including a judicial power to amend the provisions of the RPLA, which I think is the \u0026ldquo;on-the-ground\u0026rdquo; result of the decisions of the application judge and my colleagues. Therein lies our fundamental difference. And, as I shall explain in what follows, therein lies the reason for my dissent.\nI would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment, and grant the appellants the relief sought in their notice of application.\nBut first I must apologize to the reader for the length of this dissent. It turned out to be much longer than I had anticipated. In my defence, I think this appeal raises an issue of fundamental importance. Not whether the appellants are entitled to a declaration of possessory title over the Disputed Land\u0026ndash;of course they are. Everyone acknowledges the appellants have met the statutory requirements for such a declaration. But while it is important that the appellants should receive their legal due, of greater importance is the way in which the courts in this case have denied the appellants their legal due. That judicial denial raises an issue that transcends the interests of the parties to this appeal.\nCourts have become very powerful in this country. Yet, there is little that holds judges accountable for the exercise of their powers. The other branches of government\u0026ndash;the legislatures and the executives\u0026ndash;are accountable to the people for their decisions through various mechanisms, including the review of their conduct by the courts. By contrast, no one supervises the courts and the judges who populate them. (Whether that is a good thing or bad thing, I leave for others to debate in other forums.)\nFor the purposes of this case, the point I wish to make is this: for courts to play a lawful and legitimate role in a democracy, their lack of accountability mandates that judges exercise their powers with restraint and within proper bounds. In my view, and with all due respect to the application judge and my colleagues, that has not happened in this case.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n"},{"id":115,"href":"/casebook/other/ans-title-possession/","title":"Land Title and Possession in African Nova Scotian Communities","section":"Chapter 6","content":" General Introduction # Excerpted from Plan Showing LTCA Land Title Clarification Areas in Nova Scotia\nThis week, we continue to build our understanding of the relationship between possession and title that is so foundational to common law property. Our overarching question in Week 6 is as follows:\nWhy is title in land\u0026ndash;as distinguished from possession of land\u0026ndash;important? What are the justifications and consequences of the move from possession to title as part of the basic structure of a liberal market economy? We start by taking up this question in a particular place and context: recent movements to \u0026ldquo;clarify\u0026rdquo; land titles in African Nova Scotian communities as a means to address economic disadvantage and an unequal distribution of land as a consequence of discriminatory land policies in the province. These movements have placed heavy emphasis on the regularization and formalization of land titles for individuals and families who have long been in possession of land, and can help us to understand\u0026ndash;and develop a critical perspective on\u0026ndash;the social and economic role of legal title.\nIntroduction to Materials # This week, we will explore a contemporary case study of possession and title to understand how these concepts were developed in the classical legal style and the continuing influence of that way of thinking. Several African Nova Scotian communities today are experiencing the consequences of unclear legal title to community members\u0026rsquo; lands. These circumstances \u0026ldquo;stem from a history fraught with racism, oppression and inequity\u0026rdquo;1. As Justice Campbell observes at paragraphs 4-5 in Downey v Nova Scotia, below:\nAfrican Nova Scotians have been subjected to racism for hundreds of years in this province. It is embedded within the systems that govern how our society operates. That is a fundamental historical fact and an observation of present reality.\nThat has real implications for things like land ownership. Residents in African Nova Scotian communities are more likely to have unclear title to land on which they may have lived for many generations […]\nSome of the history behind African Nova Scotians\u0026rsquo; unclear land title is outlined in Beals v Nova Scotia, below. Addressing this history and its current consequences helps us to understand how the interplay of possession and title to land matters. For African Nova Scotians who continue to be denied title to their lands, state demands for individuals to \u0026ldquo;prove\u0026rdquo; their possession have become both a tool of systemic racism and a means to deflect responsibility for a long history of discrimination.\nStart by reading the included excerpts from the Land Titles Clarification Act and from Beals v Nova Scotia for background to this case study. We will then examine the following questions:\nWhat rights does the common law afford to those in possession of land (but without title)?\nWhat is adverse possession and how does this doctrine foreground the classic liberal dynamics of competition in disputes over land?\nFinally, we will return to some recent litigation in Downey v Nova Scotia concerning land titles in African Nova Scotian communities to examine the impact of common law doctrines around title and possession.\nAngela Cameron, \u0026ldquo;This Land is Our Land: African Nova Scotian Voices from the Preston Area Speak Up\u0026rdquo; (2014), online: https://nsbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/This-land-is-our-land.pdf.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":116,"href":"/problems/ans-title-clarification/","title":"Land Title Clarification in African Nova Scotian Communities","section":"Problems","content":"The context for our case study this week is described in two excerpts below from recent decisions of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. Both cases address provincial legislation called the Land Titles Clarification Act, RSNS 1989, c 250, through which individuals in possession of land can apply to have their land title \u0026ldquo;clarified\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash;that is, given formal legal recognition\u0026ndash;where title does not exist or is uncertain. The excerpts from Downey and Beals, below, sketch the basic features of this legislation and its connection to the historical settlement of African Nova Scotians.\nPlease note that, at this point, we are not reading either Downey or Beals for the specific facts of the dispute before the courts or for the legal principles involved. Instead, these excerpts provide the background context needed to understand our case study.\nAs you read the two excerpts, try to identify what rationales are offered by the courts for the process of land clarification. What is the purpose and objective of the Land Titles Clarification Act? Why, in the courts\u0026rsquo; view, is the move from possession to title important for African Nova Scotians and their communities?\n"},{"id":117,"href":"/casebook/other/title-vs-possession/","title":"Land Title versus Possession","section":"Chapter 6","content":" Edited from Plan Showing LTCA Land Title Clarification Areas\nThe act of physical control—as a crucial element of legal possession—is afforded special priority by the common law. In the case of \u0026ldquo;unowned\u0026rdquo; things, showing physical control (plus an intention to control) amounts not only to legal possession for a period of time but also to absolute ownership—at least, if the animal can no longer \u0026ldquo;escape\u0026rdquo;. Exactly how one can show sufficient physical control is, as we saw, often difficult to define and heavily dependent on the circumstances.\nNow we turn our attention to possession of land. Locke\u0026rsquo;s theory of first possession through labour applies equally to personal and real property (i.e., to \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;land\u0026rdquo;). There are important consequences of this and other ideas in Locke, especially as they relate to Indigenous land rights. This week, our focus will be on the relationship between possession and title—two related but distinct common law concepts. The title holder is often referred to as the \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;absolute\u0026rdquo; owner of the land, and they continue to hold title even when someone else is in possession of the land (with or without the owner\u0026rsquo;s permission). At the same time, someone in possession of land may enjoy certain property rights that are enforceable against other non-possessors. From the perspective of classical liberalism, possession arises from the dynamics of free competition between individuals, while title is a means to limit and stabilize that competition by granting possession the imprimatur of the state.\nKey Distinction: Title vs Possession # From the common law\u0026rsquo;s perspective, \u0026ldquo;legal title\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;legal possession\u0026rdquo; are distinct concepts. One might hold title without being in possession, or one might be in possession without title. Sometimes, possession can serve as the basis for (or \u0026ldquo;ripen\u0026rdquo; into) title, and in exceptional cases a possessor can displace the holder of legal title altogether.\n"},{"id":118,"href":"/casebook/title/ltca/","title":"Land Titles Clarification Act","section":"Chapter 3","content":" 3(1) Where the residents of an area of a municipality are in necessitous circumstances as a result of lack of property development in the area and where there appears to be confusion as to the ownership of land, the Governor in Council may designate the area as a land titles clarification area.

One of those features is the economy\u0026rsquo;s foundation in the colonial dispossession of Indigenous peoples through the institution of property and we will have much more to discuss on this topic this term and next. But colonialism is not only a feature or characteristic of the Canadian economy\u0026ndash;it also an ongoing reality that shapes how we learn about law and property, including the frameworks, theories and perspectives we use to make sense of legal rules and disputes. Colonialism shapes the interpretation and application of law, as well as the questions we tend to ask about these processes.\nBecause colonialism pervades the study of law in Canada, an important component of our course this year is to develop some tools for learning about property as part of an anti-colonial practice. We will take some time during the remainder of this introductory week to begin developing those tools. This is a big topic, but a good starting point is to reflect on how we think and speak about two core concepts at the heart of this course\u0026ndash;land and property\u0026ndash;and the relationship between them.\nAt some point early in the first year of law school, most law students confront the somewhat baffling admonishment from their professors that they (along with pretty much every other non-lawyer) have been using the term \u0026ldquo;property\u0026rdquo; all wrong. Property, they are told, is not a \u0026ldquo;thing\u0026rdquo; like land, or a car, or a bicycle\u0026ndash;so it is incorrect and inaccurate to talk about land, cars or bicycles, as we often do, as someone\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;property\u0026rdquo;. Instead, lawyers use the term \u0026ldquo;property\u0026rdquo; to denote a set of legal relationships between people with respect to things. As you read more court cases and other legal materials, you will see that jurists frequently talk about a person holding property in land or other \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo;. From the common law\u0026rsquo;s perspective, the significance of property in land is less about the land itself and more about the relationship between owners (who generally have rights to control or make decisions about the land) and non-owners (who generally don\u0026rsquo;t).\nThis way of speaking about land and property helps us to decipher many of the complex legal topics you will encounter in this course, such as the idea of legal possession, or the common law doctrine of estates in land. You will need to keep this crucial distinction in mind in order to understand and apply many of the legal sources we will study throughout the year. But this distinction between \u0026ldquo;land\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;property\u0026rdquo; is also an excellent illustration of colonialism\u0026rsquo;s ongoing influence in Anglo-Canadian law\u0026ndash;one that serves to hide or obscure other relationships concerning land and territory in ways that perpetuate and reinforce settler justifications for taking land away from Indigenous peoples. For example, Clifford Atleo and Jonathan Boron contrast the view of land as a \u0026ldquo;thing\u0026rdquo; with the understanding by many Indigenous peoples of \u0026ldquo;land as a relative\u0026hellip;with agency and worthy of respect.\u0026rdquo;1 From this perspective, the crucial distinction between \u0026ldquo;land\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;property\u0026rdquo; is not just a conceptual move that drives many of the inner-workings of the common law. This distinction is also one that has enabled and permitted Anglo-Canadian law to transform land into property and thereby sever fundamental relationships between land and Indigenous communities.\nOne of consequences of this move from \u0026ldquo;land\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;property\u0026rdquo; is to dissociate law and land relations from their particular time and place.2 To the extent that a focus on the rules of common law property allow us to abstract away from conflicts grounded in actual places and historical events, the study of property law can too easily justify or cover over both past and contemporary injustices. One way to resist this impulse is to situate the study property as much as possible in the place where we are actually learning and teaching about it.\nThree Themes of Colonialism in Law # There are many ways that we might try to decipher the causal connections between colonialism and law. Below are three recurring themes that often stand out quite clearly in the move from land to property, once we take the opportunity to identify and acknowledge them. Keep these in mind as you complete the exercise that follows and as you begin to read the cases in Unit 2.\nAhistoricism. Jurists often demonstrate a distinctive lack of concern for the history of land and of the legal rules, principles and doctrines applied to land. The common law\u0026rsquo;s tendency to transform \u0026ldquo;land\u0026rdquo; into \u0026ldquo;property\u0026rdquo; can have the direct effect of dissociating the land from its history and drawing attention away from historical claims and relationships.1 When we cover over the history behind a legal concept like \u0026ldquo;possession\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo;, it is much easier to cast that concept as natural and legitimate and fail to ask who experiences their benefits and harms.\nInvisibility. A second theme sometimes operates in direct conflict with the first, fostering a temptation to think and speak about colonization as a historical set of events rather than as a present reality.2 This perspective attempts to make the ongoing dynamics of colonialism invisible and to render historical obligations as artifacts rather than living relationships. In a legal context, the move toward invisibility drives us to devise \u0026ldquo;alternative\u0026rdquo; explanations for legal doctrines that perpetuate rather than confront colonialism.\nSubsummation. The move to subsume or submerge Indigenous legal orders and systems of knowledge\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;entire worlds\u0026rdquo;3\u0026ndash;within dominant systems of colonial law and thought is also a pervasive aspect of colonialism. From this perspective, certain allowances or exceptions are offered within the framework of the common law to account for Indigenous interests, while denying any recognition for Indigenous legal orders as legitimate systems in their own right, within a multi-juridical context. At times, subsuming Indigenous laws is achieved by making them invisible, placing Indigenous legal orders beyond the \u0026ldquo;borders of the Canadian legal imagination\u0026rdquo;.4 Other times, instead of making Indigenous laws and ways of knowing invisible, subsumation works to obscure deeper contradictions between principles or worldviews by giving them the gloss of \u0026ldquo;commensurability\u0026rdquo;. 5. The transformation of \u0026ldquo;land\u0026rdquo; into \u0026ldquo;property\u0026rdquo; rests heavily on the assumption that all relevant relationships concerning land can be subsumed within principles of common law property.\nEve Tuck and Marcia McKenzie, Place in Research: Theory, Methodology, Methods (New York: Routledge, 2014), 64.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nEve Tuck, Marcian McKenzie and Kate McCoy, \u0026ldquo;Land education: Indigenous, post-colonial, and decolonizing perspectives on place and environmental education research\u0026rdquo; (2014) 21:1 Environmental Education Research 1, 7.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nMax Liboiron, “Pollution Is Colonialism,” (Duke University Press, 2021), 54.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nPatrick Macklem, \u0026ldquo;First Nations self-government and the borders of the Canadian legal imagination\u0026rdquo; (1990) 36 McGill Law Journal 382.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIan McKay, “The Canadian Passive Revolution, 1840-1950,” Capital \u0026amp; Class (2010) 34:3, 361, 368-369.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Territorial Land Acknowledgements # Our class meetings take place in Mi\u0026rsquo;kma\u0026rsquo;ki, the lands of the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq. Beginning in 1725, the Mi’kmaq and the British entered into, and periodically renewed, a series of nation-to-nation agreements—the Peace and Friendship Treaties—that remain in force today.\nMany of you will be familiar with the concept of a land acknowledgement — the practice of acknowledging the Indigenous territory on which a class, event or meeting is taking place and recognizing or reaffirming the treaty relationships in that territory. A land acknowledgement often used at Dalhousie looks similar to or builds on this statement:\nDalhousie University is located in Mi\u0026rsquo;kma\u0026rsquo;ki, the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq. We are all Treaty people.\nStatements like these play a crucial role in building awareness and renewing ongoing relationships between settler and Indigenous communities. They are especially important for our course, where we will aim for a nuanced and detailed understanding of legal concepts like \u0026ldquo;unceded territory\u0026rdquo;.\nOne challenge associated with land acknowledgements is that they do not always give the impression of being meaningful or genuine—especially if they come across as formulaic or fail to address the ongoing injustices faced by Indigenous people. That is not a criticism of the practice of land acknowledgements itself. Instead, it is motivation to reflect on the question: what does acknowledging Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw territory at the beginning of our property law class mean for how we learn and teach in the course?\nAnti-colonialism and Obligations # title: Building an Anti-Colonial Approach short: \u0026lsquo;Anti-Colonial Approach\u0026rsquo; # Once we start to identify some prominent features of colonialism in law, what tools are available to address them and, more broadly, to pursue an anti-colonial approach to the study of property?\nOne way is to begin a course like property by identifying and thinking critically about what obligations arise from teaching and learning about property law in Mi\u0026rsquo;kma\u0026rsquo;ki\u0026ndash;a place with a long and persistent history of colonial abuses, many of which have been perpetuated through the Canadian legal system.\nWhy focus on obligations? The core idea here is that we are more likely to recognize and confront colonialism in law school if we engage seriously with what Tuck and Yang call an \u0026ldquo;ethic of incommensurability\u0026rdquo;3\u0026ndash;meaning an emphasis on the contradictions and conflicts that exist within a particular context, rather than first making uncritical attempts to reconcile them. Max Liboiron, a Red River Métis/Michif scholar, offers one way to understand this ethic of incommensurability in terms of conflicting obligations. As Liboiron points out, we all carry a web of different obligations to any pursuit, but some of those obligations \u0026ldquo;do not share a common ground for judgement or comparison\u0026rdquo; as the basis for reconciling one obligation with the other.2 According to an ethic of incommensurability, these conflicting obligations should be considered and pursued, but not simply smoothed over in a rush to avoid uncomfortable realities.\nClifford Atleo and Jonathan Boron, \u0026ldquo;Land Is Life: Indigenous Relationships to Territory and Navigating Settler Colonial Property Regimes in Canada,\u0026rdquo; Land 11, no. 5 (May 2022): 609, 610.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nMax Liboiron, “Pollution Is Colonialism,” (Duke University Press, 2021).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nEve Tuck and K Wayne Yang, \u0026ldquo;Decolonization is not a metaphor\u0026rdquo; (2012) 1(1) Decolonization: Indigeneity, Education \u0026amp; Society 1 at 28.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":120,"href":"/casebook/title/lawrence/","title":"Lawrence v Maple Trust Company","section":"Chapter 3","content":" Gillese J.A. – # Ownership of a person\u0026rsquo;s home is fraudulently transferred. The property is then mortgaged. In a contest between the two innocent parties–the homeowner and the lender of mortgage moneys–who wins? This appeal answers that question in favour of the homeowner.\nBackground # Susan Lawrence lives in her home in Toronto (the \u0026ldquo;Property\u0026rdquo;). The Property was encumbered by a mortgage in favour of TD/Canada Trust (the \u0026ldquo;TD Bank mortgage\u0026rdquo;) in the approximate amount of $120,000.\nIn October 2005, an impostor posing as Susan Lawrence retained a lawyer to sell Ms. Lawrence\u0026rsquo;s home. The impostor gave the lawyer a forged agreement of purchase and sale (the \u0026ldquo;Agreement\u0026rdquo;) under the terms of which the Property was to be sold for $318,000 to another impostor, Thomas Wright.\nThomas Wright made an application to the Maple Trust Company for the alleged purpose of funding the purchase of the Property. After following its usual due diligence procedures, Maple Trust approved the mortgage application. It had no knowledge of the fraud being perpetrated against Ms. Lawrence. At the oral hearing of the appeal, Ms. Lawrence abandoned her contention that Maple Trust failed to act with due diligence in entering into the mortgage agreement with Thomas Wright.\nOn November 21, 2005, pursuant to the Agreement, a fraudulent transfer of the Property in favour of Thomas Wright was registered. On that same day, Maple Trust advanced money pursuant to the mortgage and the TD Bank mortgage on the Property was discharged. The Maple Trust charge was registered against the Property for $291,924 on November 21, 2005, after the transfer from Lawrence to Wright had been registered.\nOn January 27, 2006, while Ms. Lawrence was at her local branch of the TD/Canada Trust bank to discuss the actual sale of her home, she discovered the fraudulent transfer and mortgage.\nIn March 2006, Maple Trust commenced an action for possession of the Property. That action was discontinued on June 14, 2006, shortly before Ms. Lawrence brought an application to have the fraudulent transfer and the mortgage set aside.\nOn June 27, 2006, Belobaba J. disposed of Ms. Lawrence\u0026rsquo;s application in a judgment [Lawrence v. Wright, [2006] O.J. No. 2907, 150 A.C.W.S. (3d) 223 (S.C.J.)] (the \u0026ldquo;Judgment\u0026rdquo;) that:\n(1) declared the transfer of the Property to the impostor, Thomas Wright, to be void and of no effect; and\n(2) upheld the validity of the Maple Trust mortgage.\nThe application judge set aside the transfer to Wright because it had been procured by fraud.\nHe refused to set aside the mortgage because of this court\u0026rsquo;s decision in Household Realty Corp. Ltd. v. Liu, 2005 CanLII 43402 (ON CA), [2005] O.J. No. 5001, 261 D.L.R. (4th) 679 (C.A.), [See Note 1 below]1 which he viewed as dispositive. In Household Realty, which is discussed more fully below, s. 78(4) of the Land Titles Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.5 (the \u0026ldquo;Act\u0026rdquo;), [See Note 2 below]2was held to override s. 155 of the Act. Section 78(4) deems a registered instrument to be effective according to its nature and intent; s. 155 provides that, subject to the provisions of the Act, registration does not validate an otherwise fraudulent and void disposition of an interest in land.\nMs. Lawrence appeals from the dismissal of her application to set aside the Maple Trust mortgage. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of the Province of Ontario (\u0026ldquo;Ontario\u0026rdquo;) intervened in support of Ms. Lawrence.\nFor the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.\nThe Issue # The issue in this case is simply enough stated. Maple Trust innocently acquired its interest in the Property in good faith, for valuable consideration and without notice of any fraud. In those circumstances, is the charge against the Property in favour of Maple Trust valid and enforceable as against the true owner of the property, despite having been acquired from a fraudster?\nThe Positions of the Parties and the Intervenor # Ms. Lawrence\u0026rsquo;s position (the common law or registry theory) # Ms. Lawrence maintains that only the true owner of land can grant an interest in, or charge on, the land and that all transactions arising from fraud are void. On this line of argument, since Wright became the registered owner of the Property through fraud, he could not grant an enforceable mortgage to Maple Trust, regardless of the fact that the transfer of the Property to him was registered. As Ms. Lawrence, the true owner, did not grant the charge in favour of Maple Trust, the charge is not valid.\nThis position reflects the common law principle that a person could not pass better title than he or she had. Accordingly, if title to an interest in land was obtained through fraud, that title could never form the root of a good and valid claim to the land.\nMaple Trust\u0026rsquo;s position (the immediate indefeasibility theory) # Maple Trust acknowledges that Ms. Lawrence is the victim of fraud. However, based on the theory of \u0026ldquo;immediate indefeasibility\u0026rdquo;, it maintains that its charge is valid. On this theory, the Act–like other land titles systems–creates a system of title by registration, not a system of registration of title. A system of title by registration is designed to protect the interests of innocent parties who rely on the register. So, once an instrument is registered, it is effective even if procured by fraud. This view reflects the notion that the fundamental purpose of the Act is not to protect \u0026ldquo;true owners\u0026rdquo; but to protect parties who rely on title, as effected by registration.\nConsequently, Maple Trust maintains that a fraudulent transferee who is a registered owner can grant a valid mortgage to a mortgagee who is acting in good faith without notice of the fraud. Thus, once the transfer to Wright was registered, the transfer was deemed to be effective and, as a bona fide purchaser who gave value for the charge and acted without notice of the fraud, Maple Trust says it was entitled to rely on Wright\u0026rsquo;s title and its charge is valid.\nThat is, Maple Trust says its charge was immediately indefeasible on registration because it took from Wright, the person that the register showed to be the registered owner. Wright\u0026rsquo;s fraud is irrelevant, insofar as the validity of Maple Trust\u0026rsquo;s charge is concerned.\nMaple Trust relies on this court\u0026rsquo;s decision in Household Realty. It argues that Household Realty is correctly decided and reflects the only rational interpretation of the Act that is consistent with the essential purpose of a land titles system for land registration.\nMaple Trust acknowledges that its view results in some innocent parties being deprived of legitimate interests in land but argues that the Act provides for the establishment and maintenance of the Land Titles Assurance Fund (the \u0026ldquo;Fund\u0026rdquo;) as a means for compensating persons whose interests have been wrongfully affected. Ms. Lawrence, it maintains, can attempt to recover her losses from the Fund.\nOntario\u0026rsquo;s position (the deferred indefeasibility theory) # Ontario advances a view of the legislation based on the theory of \u0026ldquo;deferred indefeasibility\u0026rdquo;. On this theory, there are three classes of parties: the original owner; the intermediate owner, who is the person who dealt with the party responsible for the fraud; and, the deferred owner, a bona fide purchaser or encumbrancer for value without notice who takes from the intermediate owner. Only a deferred owner would defeat the original owner\u0026rsquo;s title. This is because the intermediate owner, as the party who acquired an interest in title from the fraudster, had an opportunity to investigate the transaction and avoid the fraud whereas the deferred owner did not. On the theory of deferred indefeasibility, registration of a void instrument does not cure its defect, thus neither the instrument nor its registration gives good title. However, good title can be obtained by a deferred owner from an intermediate owner.\nIn the instant case, Ms. Lawrence is the original owner and Maple Trust, having dealt with the fraudster, Thomas Wright, is the intermediate owner. There is no deferred owner.\nOntario maintains that because Maple Trust, the intermediate owner, had an opportunity to investigate the transaction and avoid the fraud, its charge is invalid in respect of Ms. Lawrence. Had an innocent deferred owner been involved, however, Ontario maintains that the innocent deferred owner would have obtained good title as against the original owner.\nOntario makes a second argument against the validity of the Maple Trust charge. This argument is based on the following chain of reasoning. When a document is tendered for receipt, date-stamped and numbered, pursuant to s. 78(2) of the Act, the Registrar has a period of 21 days to object. If no objection is made, registration of the instrument is complete and, pursuant to s. 78(3), the time of registration reverts back to the date of receipt. However, s. 78(3) does not give retroactive effect to events that occurred in the period between the time of receipt of the instrument and the completion of registration. Maple Trust advanced money immediately after the transfer was received for registration. As the 21-day period had not expired at the time that it advanced funds and s. 78(3) does not give retroactive effect to events occurring within the 21-day period, Maple Trust is not entitled to rely on s. 78(4) to claim a valid interest.\nThe Key Legislative Provisions and the Act in Brief # The resolution of this difficult matter revolves around the effect to be given to ss. 78(4) and 155 of the Act. Those sections read as follows:\n78(4) When registered, an instrument shall be deemed to be embodied in the register and to be effective according to its nature and intent, and to create, transfer, charge or discharge, as the case requires, the land or estate or interest therein mentioned in the register.\n. . . . .\nSubject to the provisions of this Act, with respect to registered dispositions for valuable consideration, any disposition of land or of a charge on land that, if unregistered, would be fraudulent and void is, despite registration, fraudulent and void in like manner. Section 155 of the Act derives from s. 98 of the Land Titles and Transfer Act, 1875 (U.K.), 38 \u0026amp; 39 Vict., c. 87.\nSection 78(4), on the other hand, came into existence in 1960 through the passage of Bill 21, An Act to Amend the Land Titles Act, 1st Sess., 26th Leg., Ontario, 1960, which amended what was then s. 54 of the Land Titles Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 197. The explanatory note to that section of Bill 21 reads as follows:\nThis section is re-enacted to clarify registration procedures and to establish priorities.\nAt the first reading of Bill 21 in the legislature, [See Note 3 below]3 the Minister said:\nMr. Speaker, while there are a number of changes, this again is in relation to the 1960 revision and the clarification and improvement in the wording, and there is no change in major principles involved.\nAt the second reading of Bill 21, [See Note 4 below]4 the Minister reiterated:\nBasically these changes are simply to get the Act in tidier form for revision of the 1960 statutes. Changes clarify the intent and improve the nomenclature of the existing Act.\nTo place ss. 78(4) and 155 in context, it is useful to consider the overall purposes of the Act and the principles underlying it. In Durrani v. Augier (2000), 2000 CanLII 22410 (ON SC), 50 O.R. (3d) 353, [2000] O.J. No. 2960 (S.C.J.), at paras. 40-42, Epstein J. gave this helpful summary:\nThe land titles system was established in Ontario in 1885, and was modeled on the English Land Transfer Act of 1875. It is currently known as the Land Titles Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.5. Most Canadian provinces have similar legislation.\nThe essential purpose of land titles legislation is to provide the public with security of title and facility of transfer: Di Castri, Registration of Title to Land, vol. 2 looseleaf (Toronto: Carswell, 1987) at p. 17-32. The notion of title registration establishes title by setting up a register and guaranteeing that a person named as the owner has perfect title, subject only to registered encumbrances and enumerated statutory exceptions.\nThe philosophy of a land titles system embodies three principles, namely, the mirror principle, where the register is a perfect mirror of the state of title; the curtain principle, which holds that a purchaser need not investigate the history of past dealings with the land, or search behind the title as depicted on the register; and the insurance principle, where the state guarantees the accuracy of the register and compensates any person who suffers loss as the result of an inaccuracy. These principles form the doctrine of indefeasibility of title and [are] the essence of the land titles system: . . .\nAnalysis # While a consideration of the two theories of indefeasibility is inevitable in this case, it is the relevant legislative provisions that must drive the analysis; thus I begin there.\nIn large measure, the issue posed by this appeal flows from the introductory clause to s. 155, namely, \u0026ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act\u0026rdquo;. It will be recalled that s. 155 reads as follows:\nSubject to the provisions of this Act, with respect to registered dispositions for valuable consideration, any disposition of land or of a charge on land that, if unregistered, would be fraudulent and void is, despite registration, fraudulent and void in like manner. Put to one side, for the moment, the introductory clause in s. 155. Without that clause, s. 155 provides that a charge on land that would be fraudulent and void if unregistered, remains fraudulent and void despite registration. The challenge is to interpret s. 155 in light of the clause. What does it mean that a registered charge remains fraudulent and void \u0026ldquo;subject to the provisions of this Act\u0026rdquo;? In particular, how is s. 155 to be interpreted subject to s. 78(4), which provides that an instrument is deemed effective on registration?\nSection 78(4), it will be recalled, reads as follows:\n78(4) When registered, an instrument shall be deemed to be embodied in the register and to be effective according to its nature and intent, and to create, transfer, charge or discharge, as the case requires, the land or estate or interest therein mentioned in the register.\nAt common law, Maple Trust\u0026rsquo;s charge was void. Why? Because it took from Wright and Wright could not give better title than he had. He had nothing because he obtained title by fraud.\nOn the theory of immediate indefeasibility, the fact that the transfer to Wright is void by virtue of having been obtained by fraud is irrelevant. The register showed Wright as the registered owner. Maple Trust was not party to the fraud so it was entitled to rely on the register; it did not need to go behind it. Title is deemed effective by virtue of registration of the transfer and Maple Trust was entitled to rely on it.\nThis argument, in terms of the Act, runs like this. Although s. 155 provides that Maple Trust\u0026rsquo;s charge remains void despite having been registered, it is to be read subject to the other provisions in the Act, including s. 78(4). Maple Trust relies on s. 78(4) to treat the transfer to Wright as effective. The combined effect of ss. 78(4) and 155 results in its charge being immediately indefeasible.\nOntario, relying on the theory of deferred indefeasibility, argues that the Maple Trust charge is not valid as against Ms. Lawrence because it was obtained from a fraudster. As Wright did not hold a valid title, he could not validly charge the Property. However, as Maple Trust acted without fraud and registered its charge, a deferred owner could take from Maple Trust and obtain an indefeasible title.\nPut in terms of the Act, the deferred indefeasibility argument runs like this. As Wright obtained title to the Property by means of a fraudulent transfer, the transfer was void. As the transfer was void, it was of no effect and Wright never became the registered owner. Section 68(1) of the Act provides that only the registered owner may dispose of an interest in land. [See Note 5 below]5 Maple Trust never took from the registered owner and therefore cannot rely on s. 78(4) vis-à-vis Ms. Lawrence, the true owner. However, Maple Trust was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. It registered its charge. The fact of registration enables Maple Trust to pass a valid title to a third party, so long as the third party is also a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. This third party (i.e., the deferred owner) relies on both ss. 68(1) and 78(4). Unlike Wright, Maple Trust did not take by way of fraud so it is a registered owner for the purposes of s. 68(1). And, the deferred owner is, therefore, entitled to rely on the charge pursuant to s. 78(4). On this view, all of ss. 68(1), 78(4) and 155 are given effect. [See Note 6 below]6\nHaving found that the interpretations urged by both Maple Trust and Ontario are available on the wording of the Act, it becomes necessary to consider the vexed question of whether the Act is predicated on the theory of immediate indefeasibility or deferred indefeasibility. Before doing so, I will briefly explain why I do not accept the appellant\u0026rsquo;s submission on how the relevant provisions should be construed.\nRejection of the appellant\u0026rsquo;s theory of the Act # In my view, the appellant\u0026rsquo;s argument that fraudulent documents are void for all time and all purposes, regardless of registration, is contrary to the notion of a land titles system and the provisions of the Act. If accepted, this view would serve to bring back the registry system of land holding. It would negate the mirror and curtain principles and those provisions in the Act [See Note 7 below]7 that reflect those principles as, notwithstanding the registration of a series of transfers and/ or charges, a person could never rely on the register since title would depend on the validity of all past transactions in the chain of ownership. The chain of title would be forever broken by any fraudulent link.\nClearly, the Act is not intended to establish a land registry system. Even if the relevant provisions, narrowly construed, were capable of supporting the interpretation urged by the appellant, I would reject such an interpretation as it would defeat the entire purpose of the Act, which is to establish a land titles system, simplify conveyancing and overcome the insecurity of title inherent in a registry system.\nImmediate or deferred indefeasibility # In her seminal article, \u0026ldquo;Indefeasibility of Title in the Canadian Context\u0026rdquo; (1976) 26 U.T.L.J. 173, Professor Marcia Neave explains that while the land titles legislation in other Canadian provinces followed the Australian true Torrens model, the Ontario Act was modeled on English legislation. She foreshadowed the difficulties that the courts would face in grappling with the notion of indefeasibility, saying at p. 174:\nOne of the more difficult decisions facing courts interpreting Torrens legislation has been the choice between the opposing theories of immediate and deferred indefeasibility of title. Proponents of immediate indefeasibility take the view that an innocent purchaser of land, who registers an instrument which is void through forgery or breach of some statutory or common law requirement, should attain an indefeasible title by registration. It is argued that the policy of a system of title registration is to protect a person who registers without fraud. The fact that the instrument registered was void before registration is regarded as irrelevant. On the other hand, proponents of deferred indefeasibility argue that Torrens legislation was not intended to override the fundamental common law rules governing void instruments. The registration of a void instrument cannot cure its defect. Nevertheless the Torrens system ensures that the void instrument, when registered, can form the root of a good title. A person who registers an instrument executed by the innocent registered proprietor attains indefeasibility on the registration of his own dealing. Thus indefeasibility is \u0026lsquo;deferred\u0026rsquo; to the second purchaser. (Footnote omitted)\nProfessor Neave then noted that the theory of deferred indefeasibility prevailed, in Ontario and elsewhere in Canada, following the decision of the Privy Council on appeal from the Supreme Court of Victoria in Gibbs v. Messer, [1891] A.C. 248 (P.C.). [See Note 8 below]8 She ended the article with this description of the Act which, although unflattering, does much to explain the difficulties faced by the courts when attempting to decide matters such as that presented by this appeal:\nIn conclusion, I believe that the provisions of the Ontario Land Titles Act relating to indefeasibility, rectification of the register, and compensation from the Assurance Fund are an unfortunate hotch-potch of ill-matching sections drawn from widely different sources.\nWith that backdrop, I turn to consider which of the two theories best accords with the provisions of the Act. In my view, the answer to that question lies in the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in United Trust Co. v. Dominion Stores Ltd., 1976 CanLII 33 (SCC), [1977] 2 S.C.R. 915, [1976] S.C.J. No. 99, viewed within the context of policy considerations.\nIn United Trust, Dominion Stores was a tenant in a property purchased by United Trust. United Trust had actual notice of Dominion\u0026rsquo;s unregistered lease at the time that it bought the property. It had attempted, unsuccessfully, to negotiate a surrender of the Dominion lease prior to the purchase. After the purchase, United Trust locked Dominion out of the premises and took the position that its registered transfer had priority over all unregistered interests, including Dominion\u0026rsquo;s unregistered lease. Dominion applied for an order granting relief from forfeiture and reinstatement in the premises.\nAt first instance, the trial judge held in favour of Dominion. An appeal to this court was dismissed. A further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed with the result that United Trust took title subject to Dominion\u0026rsquo;s unregistered lease. When considering which of the two theories underpins the Act, it is instructive to consider the reasoning of the majority, by way of contrast to that of Laskin C.J.C., in dissent.\nChief Justice Laskin would have found in favour of United Trust: actual notice of an unregistered interest in the land did not matter because United Trust was a bona fide purchaser for value who obtained its transfer from the registered owner. He saw fraud as the only exception to the integrity of the register.\nChief Justice Laskin\u0026rsquo;s reasoning, in my view, is based on the theory of immediate indefeasibility. At pp. 919 and 926 S.C.R., he wrote:\nWe face here another instance of a temptation to construe a statute in the light of the common law, to qualify a statute by an equitable doctrine alien to the purpose (a clear purpose in the circumstances underlying its enactment) which the statute sought to achieve. Because notice of unregistered interests was not expressly excluded as a qualifying consideration, the integrity of the land titles register is shaken by the judgment in appeal, although the scheme and language of The Land Titles Act are, in my opinion, adequate enough to show the irrelevancy of such notice.\n. . . . .\nIf fairness from a common law standpoint was the dominant consideration, irrespective of legislative policy, irrespective of the circumstances which brought title registration systems into being, there could be less quarrel with the decision of the Courts below. We are not, however, concerned with the common law, but rather with a complete break from it through a choice of legislative policy reflected in some countries and in some Canadian Provinces by adoption of the Torrens system, and in England and Ontario by the adoption of a related system of title registration.\n. . . . .\nTo repeat myself, I am unable to appreciate how there can be any escape from the force of ss. 52 and 91 of the present Act which constitute a code as to the title that is acquired upon first registration and upon a transfer on the register. The supporting provisions, especially ss. 75, 78 and s. 79(1), show that registration is the method of obtaining protection of claimed interests in registered land and that only fraud is an external qualifying consideration.\nChief Justice Laskin concludes, at p. 936 S.C.R.:\nTo import actual notice in a title registration system without its express preservation is to change the basic character of the system. It is impossible, in my view, to adhere to the principle of the primacy of the register and at the same time to make it yield to a doctrine of notice.\nThe majority rejects the view that registered title is absolute, save and except for fraud. It held that s. 85 of the Land Titles Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 234, (now s. 78 of the Act) did not abrogate or displace the common law as it relates to land law in Ontario. In doing so, it quoted with approval the following passage by Meredith J.A. in In re Skill and Thompson, [1908] O.J. No. 41, 17 O.L.R. 186 (C.A.), at pp. 194-95 O.L.R. [paras. 39-40]:\nThe Land Titles Act is not an Act to abolish the law of real property; it is an Act far more harmless in that respect than in some quarters seems to be imagined, at times, at all events, when the wish is father to the imagination. It is an Act to simplify titles and facilitate the transfer of land; and, doubtless, greater familiarity with it will tend to remove a good many false notions regarding its revolutionary character.\nIts main purpose is to assure the title to a purchaser from a registered owner; but, surely, it is not one of its purposes to protect a registered owner against his own obligations, much less against his own fraud: (Citation omitted)\nAt pp. 950 to 952 of United Trust, Spence J., for the majority, explains why United Trust could not rely on the register to take free of Dominion\u0026rsquo;s interest and emphasizes that common law principles are not to be assumed to have been abrogated by the Act.\nIt is the appellant\u0026rsquo;s argument that the enactment of the Torrens land titles system in the Province of Ontario made applicable in that province the main theory of a Torrens title registration system, to wit, the absolute authority of the register, and that it is the effect of such a principle that actual notice, no matter how clearly proved so long as encumbrances do not appear on the register, does not affect the clear title of the purchaser for value. I am ready to agree that this is a prime principle of the Torrens system and that it has been referred to as such by various text writers which I need not cite in support thereof.\nThe Torrens Registration System was the brainchild of a Mr. Robert Torrens of South Australia and, due to his perseverance, a statute embodying the principles of his land titles system was enacted in South Australia in 1857. Similar statutes based on the same principles and using the same technique were enacted in rapid succession in Queensland in 1861, in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales in 1862, in New Zealand in 1870, and in Western Australia in 1874. Use of the system spread to Canada and a like statute was enacted in the Colony of Vancouver Island in 1861, and then in the Province of British Columbia in 1869. The Land Titles Act was enacted in Ontario in 1885. At that time, the Legislature in Ontario had before it as models all these previous enactments which I have listed. In every case, those enactments contained an express provision making actual notice ineffective to encumber the registered title.\n. . . .\nHowever, in Ontario, only a few years after the enactment of The Land Titles Act, the courts have expressed a disinclination to imply such an extinction of the doctrine of actual notice. There is no doubt that such doctrine as to all contractual relations and particularly the law of real property has been firmly based in our law since the beginning of equity. It was the view of those courts, and it is my view, that such a cardinal principle of property law cannot be considered to have been abrogated unless the legislative enactment is in the clearest and most unequivocal of terms. Such a provision, as I have said, does appear in all the other statutes cited by the appellant.\nIn my view, United Trust cannot be read as simply a decision that registered interests in land are subject to the doctrine of actual notice. The notion of \u0026ldquo;absolute\u0026rdquo; title–that is, immediate indefeasibility–cannot be reconciled with the result or the reasoning of the majority. The theory of immediate indefeasibility would have led, as Laskin C.J.C. wrote, to United Trust taking title to the property free of Dominion\u0026rsquo;s claim because, when United Trust took title, the register did not reflect Dominion\u0026rsquo;s interest and fraud was not involved.\nThe theory of deferred indefeasibility, on the other hand, is consistent with both the result and the reasoning of the majority. United Trust took its title from the registered owner. There is no suggestion of fraud on the part of United Trust. Nonetheless, the majority held that United Trust\u0026rsquo;s title was subject to Dominion\u0026rsquo;s unregistered lease. The majority recognizes that the Act creates a land titles system but rejects the notion of immediate indefeasibility. Thus, although not couched in those terms, it appears that the majority subscribes to the theory of deferred indefeasibility, a theory which permits the common law to remain a part of the law of Ontario, unless expressly abrogated. Indeed, the majority explicitly states that the common law principles of real property are not abrogated absent clear and unequivocal language to that effect in the Act.\nDeferred indefeasibility is consistent with s. 155, a statutory enshrinement of the common law albeit \u0026ldquo;subject to the provisions of [the] Act\u0026rdquo;. As previously explained, it is consistent also with an interpretation of s. 68(1) that recognizes the common law principle that a fraudster can never take good title so as to become the owner but also enables Maple Trust to be recognized as the registered owner for the purposes of the deferred owner. As Maple Trust registered its charge and its charge was not obtained by fraud, a bona fide purchaser for value without notice (i.e., a deferred owner) could rely on a combination of ss. 68(1) and 78(4) to take an indefeasible interest from Maple Trust.\nDeferred indefeasibility is consistent also with an historical analysis of what is now s. 78. Section 78 came into existence as part of minor administrative changes in the Act made in 1960. Such changes were not intended to make or change substantive law. Rather, the changes were aimed at facilitating registration procedures. [See Note 9 below]9 An interpretation of s. 78(4) that would lead to immediate indefeasibility is far from a minor administrative change.\nFurther and most importantly, in my view, deferred indefeasibility is also preferable for policy reasons. Under the theory of immediate indefeasibility, the innocent homeowner has no defence to a mortgagee\u0026rsquo;s action for possession. The homeowner is exposed to the loss of her home through eviction with the only available remedy being to make a claim for loss of value of the property from the Fund. The idea that a person who buys a specific parcel of land with a specific house on it should be compensated in damages runs contrary to the notion that real property, in such circumstances, is not fungible. To see a lender compensated in damages does not offend that same notion.\nMoreover, unlike the intermediate owner, the homeowner has no opportunity to avoid the fraud. Ms. Lawrence had no ability to discover that her home was being fraudulently sold and mortgaged. By contrast, Maple Trust made the decision to advance money and had the opportunity to avoid the fraud. By interpreting the Act in accordance with the theory of deferred indefeasibility, the law encourages lenders to be vigilant when making mortgages and places the burden of the fraud on the party that has the opportunity to avoid it, rather than the innocent homeowner who played no role in the perpetration of the fraud.\nHousehold Realty considered # I think it fair to say that until recently, to the limited extent that this issue has been considered by Ontario courts, the courts have followed the deferred indefeasibility approach. See Rabi v. Rosu, 2006 CanLII 36623 (ON SC), [2006] O.J. No. 4348, 48 R.P.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.J.), at paras. 43-46, where Echlin J. sets out the case law showing that the doctrine of deferred indefeasibility historically has been applied.\nHousehold Realty casts doubt on the validity of that approach. [See Note 10 below]10\nIn Household Realty, a husband and wife owned their matrimonial home as joint tenants. The wife forged her husband\u0026rsquo;s signature on a power of attorney, naming her as his attorney. She then registered the power of attorney on title. She obtained a line of credit for $150,000 from the TD Bank, who registered a charge on the property. She then obtained a mortgage for $260,000 from the CIBC and a further mortgage from Household Realty for approximately $96,250. Those mortgages were registered on title as well.\nWhen the wife defaulted on the mortgage payments, the mortgagees sued both the husband and wife. The husband defended on the basis that he was the innocent victim of a fraud and that since he had not signed the two mortgages, the mortgagees did not receive valid mortgages that could bind the property. It was accepted that the mortgagees were unaware that the registered power of attorney was fraudulent.\nAt first instance, the mortgagees obtained an order declaring the mortgages valid. This court affirmed the trial decision, holding that once the charges were registered, as they had been given for valuable consideration and without notice of the fraud, pursuant to s. 78(4) they were immediately effective according to their nature and intent. By reason of the introductory clause in s. 155, s. 78(4) was held to override the general provision in s. 155 regarding the effect of fraud on registered land titles documents. The court stated that an instrument, once registered, can be immediately relied on as valid and effective by reason of the wording of s. 78(4).\nAt paras. 41 to 42 of the reasons, the court explicitly stated that it did not find it necessary to decide whether, in Ontario, the Act provides for deferred or immediate indefeasibility.\nThe mortgagees in Household Realty relied on the register which showed the parties as the registered owners. In fact, the wife was one of the registered owners and her title was valid–it had not been obtained by fraud. Even if an argument can be made that, in respect of the wife\u0026rsquo;s interest, the mortgagees took from a registered owner, the same cannot be said in respect of the husband\u0026rsquo;s interest. [See Note 11 below]11 The result in Household Realty, at least in respect of the husband\u0026rsquo;s interest in the property, is inconsistent with the theory of deferred indefeasibility.\nFurther, the language in Household Realty fails to recognize that the Act gives statutory effect to the theory of deferred indefeasibility. For the reasons already given, I consider both the result and that reasoning to be incorrect. I note that it appears that the United Trust decision was not considered by this court when it decided Household Realty.\nConclusion # The theory of deferred indefeasibility accords with the Act and must be taken into consideration in an analysis of s. 155 and its relationship with other provisions in the Act. Under this theory, the party acquiring an interest in land from the party responsible for the fraud (the \u0026ldquo;intermediate owner\u0026rdquo;) is vulnerable to a claim from the true owner because the intermediate owner had an opportunity to avoid the fraud. However, any subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer (the \u0026ldquo;deferred owner\u0026rdquo;) has no such opportunity. Therefore, in accord with s. 78(4) and the theory of deferred indefeasibility, the deferred owner acquires an interest in the property that is good as against all the world.\nWright never took valid title to the Property because he obtained it by fraud. He was, therefore, not a registered owner. In accordance with s. 68(1) of the Act, only a registered owner may give valid charges on land. Maple Trust is the intermediate owner of an interest in the Property. It had an opportunity to avoid the fraud. It did not take from a registered owner. Therefore, despite registering its charge, Maple Trust loses in a contest with the true registered owner, Ms. Lawrence. Accordingly, the charge against the Property in favour of Maple Trust should be set aside.\nSome Additional Comments # This appeal raised two other matters that warrant comment.\nThe first relates to Ontario\u0026rsquo;s alternative argument, summarized earlier when setting out its position, that Maple Trust could not rely on s. 78(4) to claim that its charge was valid because it advanced the mortgage funds less than 21 days after the transfer to Wright was tendered for registration.\nIn light of the conclusion reached above, it is unnecessary to deal with this argument. Having said that, I wish to emphasize that nothing in these reasons is to be taken as acceptance of that argument. Adopting such a proposition would turn modern-day conveyancing on its head, given the current practice of closing purchases and mortgages on the same day. Were it necessary to decide this issue, I would be loathe to interpret the Act in a fashion that would undermine its essential purpose of facilitating transactions in respect of land.\nThe second relates to the suggestion that Maple Trust, an innocent lender, would be unable to turn to the Fund for compensation. This, it was said, arises from the precondition for recovery under the Act that an applicant must actually receive an interest in the land and then lose it. It was suggested that the theory of deferred indefeasibility leads to the conclusion that Maple Trust never acquired an interest in the Property and, therefore, never lost it. [See Note 12 below]12 Indeed, this is one of the arguments levied against the theory of deferred indefeasibility on the basis that Maple Trust\u0026rsquo;s inability to recover from the Fund offends the insurance principle.\nIn my view, the theory of deferred indefeasibility as reflected in the Act, does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that Maple Trust never acquired an interest in the Property. It is at least arguable that it did acquire such an interest. However, the interest that it acquired was subject to defeat by the true registered owner of the Property, for the reasons already given. The existence of an interest, albeit one that is defeasible in very limited circumstances, is demonstrated by the fact that if a bona fide third party took from Maple Trust, for value and without notice (i.e., a deferred owner), its interest would be indefeasible. Even in an action between the deferred owner and the true owner, the deferred owner would win. If Maple Trust had no interest in the Property, what did it convey to the deferred owner and why would the deferred owner succeed?\nIt is correct that at common law, Maple Trust had no interest in the Property. That is because Maple Trust acquired its interest from Wright and Wright never had good title as he procured title by fraud. At common law, Wright could convey no better title than he had. It is also correct that s. 155 provides that Maple Trust\u0026rsquo;s charge, which would have been void if unregistered, remains void despite registration. However, that result is expressly made \u0026ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act\u0026rdquo;. As previously explained, the provisions of the Act made Maple Trust a registered owner and enabled a deferred owner to take good title from it.\nArguably, once s. 155 is understood in accordance with the theory of deferred indefeasibility, it has the effect of transforming what would have been a void interest on the part of Maple Trust at common law into a valid interest that was defeasible by the true owner. This view is consonant with the conclusion that, as an intermediate owner, Maple Trust\u0026rsquo;s interest in the Property had to yield to the rights of the true owner but that, because of registration of its charge, a deferred owner could rely on Maple Trust\u0026rsquo;s charge to obtain an indefeasible title.\nI would hasten to add that these comments are intended only to clarify my views of how the theory of deferred indefeasibility operates, as expressed in the Act. They are not intended to decide the question whether Maple Trust is entitled to compensation from the Fund. That determination is for another body at another time.\nDisposition # Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and set aside paras. 2 and 3 of the judgment. I would grant the application and set aside the charge in favour of Maple Trust but order Ms. Lawrence to pay to Maple Trust the value of the benefit she received as a result of the discharge of the TD Bank mortgage.\nI would order costs of the appeal and the application to the appellant fixed at $20,000 and $5,000, respectively, such costs to be payable by the respondent and to be inclusive of disbursements and GST. No order as to costs in respect of the Intervenor.\nAppeal allowed.\nNotes # 68(1) No person, other than the registered owner, is entitled to transfer or charge registered freehold or leasehold land by a registered disposition.\nThe jurisdiction to adopt a strained interpretation in order to promote the purpose of legislation or avoid absurdity is well established and frequently exercised.\nNote 1: [Sub nom.] CIBC Mortgages Inc. v.

This was indeed so far admitted at the argument that the plaintiffs did not claim to dispossess the defendant of that part of the land which he had actually cultivated and occupied, but as he had defended for a portion of it which was still in a wilderness state, they contended that they were entitled to a verdict for that. The defendant, however, contends that as the deeds under which he claims, contain the uncultivated as well as the cultivated land, and he or those under whom he claims have held by those deeds for upwards of 50 years that he is entitled to retain both.\nIt has long been recognized as law that when a man without colour of title, claims to hold land under the statute against him who shows title that he shall only retain what he has actually occupied for 20 years.\nBut the defendant maintains that when the original entry was under colour of title and possession, and was taken by metes and bounds, 20 years actual occupation of part gives the virtual possession of the whole so as to establish a title under the statute, and reference was made to several cases decided in the United States in support of this position.\nThe situation of lands in this Province resembles that of those in the United States so much more than of those old and long cultivated lands in the mother country, that we may frequently consider with advantage the view which their courts have taken of questions of this nature. And on turning to their reports and elementary writers, I find that although they sustain the position of one who enters and holds for 20 years under color of title they have guarded it with so many reasonable exceptions that there is little danger of injuring the rightful owner in cases of conflicting constructive possession. It would occupy too much time to cite the cases at length upon this subject, they are fully detailed and ably commented upon in Angel on Limitations (Chap. 31). See also the observations of Story, J., in Prescott et al., vs. Nevers, [4 Mason, 430.]\nOur natural sense of justice points out a strong distinction between a lawless intruder who enters upon the land of another without any pretence to claim it as his own, and one who deems he has a right to enter, but is not clothed with a strictly legal title. There can be little doubt that the object of the Legislature in passing the Statute of Limitations was rather to shield those who held under defective titles than to protect mere wrongdoers; although their object could not effectually be maintained without barring all investigation into the legal title where the owner had allowed an adverse possession to be held against him for 20 years, and thus sheltering both.\nIf ever there was a defendant who might most conscientiously claim the protection of the statute, it is the defendant in this case. The grant to Belcher passed in 1773: after his death the title vested in the Kirbys, in 1779, who took possession of the southern portion of the land by their agent, and commenced improvements upon it, but although they were in the constructive possession of the whole tract of five thousand acres or more, no act of ownership was ever exercised by them or their agents upon the northern part of the tract, although they held the land until the year 1813, when the conveyance was made to Murphy. In 1784 long prior to this, the grant called the soldiers grant had passed to Sutherland and others, bounded southerly upon the north line of the Belcher\u0026rsquo;s grant. The passing of a grant of so large a tract of land, 12,250 acres, to a numerous body of recently disbanded soldiers must have been a matter of great notoriety in the settlement, and yet there does not appear to have been any opposition given by those interested in the Belcher grant to laying out the soldiers grant by a line far to the south of that now claimed as the north line of the Belcher grant. In this state things appear to have remained until the sale to Murphy in 1813, forty years after the Belcher grant passed and I think it well worthy of remark that the plan annexed to the conveyance to Murphy indicates an acquiescence in the south line which had been run for the soldiers grant. For in the deed to Murphy there is a reservation of town lots without any other description of their position than a reference to the plan, and on that plan we find them laid down very near the north line, while the north line now claimed is nearly two miles to the southward of them. There is no proof of any attempt having been made to run the line 480 chains north from the shore, until after the sale to Murphy, nor has anything further been done than running out the lines according to the description in the grant, although the defendant and several others claiming under the soldiers grant were then living within those lines. Watt, himself, so far recognized a line of the soldiers grant farther south than that now claimed, that subsequent to the running of this north line he expressed his surprise, \u0026ldquo;said it was not his land, that it was the soldiers grant, and he did not claim the land there.\u0026rdquo;\nWhile all this is permitted by the lessees of the plaintiff, and those under whom they claim, let us see what is actually done by those under whom the defendant claims. William Sutherland, one of the grantees in the soldiers grant, it appears, drew No. 4, the lot now occupied by defendant, and on the 4th Oct., 1792, he conveyed it with all the buildings and improvements thereon, by very particularly described metes and bounds, to John Peitzsh, as a lot containing 650 acres. This deed was recorded 4th July, 1798. On the 21st April, 1798, John Peitzsh conveyed the same lots by the same metes and bounds to Hugh McDonald, the grandfather of the defendant. This deed was recorded Sept. 25th, l798. Hugh McDonald resided on the land, cultivated and improved it, and from him it has descended to the defendant. At what precise time William Sutherland, the grantee, took possession of this lot in severalty, does not appear, but it was evidently before 1792, when he conveyed it with a dwelling house, cow house, etc, to Peitzsh. Nearly 60 years ago then the grantee sold it and it has since passed from purchaser to purchaser. It has descended from grandson to grandson, and has been held adversely to the lessors of the plaintiff and those under whom they claim, ever since Sutherland, the grantee, first took possession of it.\nAlthough the possession was originally taken erroneously there is no reason even to surmise that the error was intentional, no one who has been long conversant with the proceedings in this court will be surprised at it: grants, particularly those conveying large tracts of land, were seldom, if ever, laid out with any approach to accuracy, and though the mistake was a great one, and that south line of the soldiers grant, if established, would deprive the claimants of the Belcher grant of 2,000 acres of land; yet it was not greater than that originally committed by the officer of the Crown, who, with the intention of granting, 5,000 acres of land, described it by metes and bounds, which according to the testimony of Kent, included upwards of 8,000; such mistakes were of frequent occurrence, sometimes operating against the grantees, but more frequently in their favor.\nBut without adverting to motives with which we have little to do, it is clear that in point of view, a grantee under the soldiers grant took possession upwards of 60 years ago of a lot of land as part of that grant which it now clearly appears had been granted to Belcher. That he conveyed it by metes and bounds to Peitzsh in 1792, that Peitzsh conveyed it to McDonald in 1798 by the same metes and bounds, and from McDonald it has descended to his grandson, the defendant, who has long occupied it and exercised the usual acts of ownership over property of that nature, and therefore without laying down any inflexible rule as to adverse possession taken by metes and bounds under color of title, I think that under the circumstances of this case, the defendant is well entitled to hold all that his grandfather bought; and therefore that the rule to set aside this verdict should be discharged.\n"},{"id":122,"href":"/casebook/other/liberalism/","title":"Liberalism","section":"Chapter 6","content":"As both a framework for and political tradition in Western legal thought, \u0026ldquo;liberalism\u0026rdquo; is core to the logic of Anglo-Canadian law and related legal orders in a globalized world.1 As Ian McKay argues:2\n[T]he category \u0026lsquo;Canada\u0026rsquo; should \u0026hellip; denote a historically specific project of rule, rather than either an essence we must defend or an empty homogeneous space we must possess. Canada-as-project can be analyzed through the study of the implantation and expansion over a heterogeneous terrain of a certain politico-economic logic\u0026ndash;to wit, liberalism.\nThe basic tenant of liberalism holds that all human beings should be free to pursue their own ends and, in pursuit of those ends, free to compete with one another. A central dilemma arises, however, when we recognize that society as a whole can only benefit from free competition when social controls limit individual freedoms to some degree. In other words, individual freedom for any one person\u0026ndash;as measured by the degree to which that person is free from societal control\u0026ndash;is simply impossible without putting societal limits on the freedoms of everyone else.\nThe \u0026ldquo;vocabulary\u0026rdquo; of common law legal arguments—the lexicon of typical, patterned argument types used by judges and lawyers to debate and reason through the merits of a case\u0026ndash;gives rise to a nagging question: how can arguments with this structure ever help us to resolve a case, to decide which judgement is more convincing or persuasive? If every argument bite has one or more predictable counter-argument bites, how does one side ever \u0026ldquo;win out\u0026rdquo; over the other?\nFrom a historical perspective, the answer to this question depends on when we are asking it. Borrowing from legal-historical studies in other liberal Western democracies, we can compare two contrasting traditions in Anglo-Canadian legal thought over the past few hundred years: the classical tradition and the modern tradition. While legal arguments in these two traditions share a basic structure or \u0026ldquo;grammar\u0026rdquo; of liberalism and the liberal dilemma, they differ dramatically in terms of \u0026ldquo;style\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash;that is, how this basic grammar is employed and presented to persuade its audience.3\nHow Anglo-Canadian jurists have tried to resolve the basic dilemma of liberalism has given rise to the different traditions of legal thought we\u0026rsquo;ll explore throughout the course. To help us define the features of the \u0026ldquo;classical\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;modern\u0026rdquo; styles, we can ask three guiding questions:4\nWhich side of the liberal dilemma is emphasized or given priority in the reasoning\u0026ndash;free competition between individuals (classical) or societal limitations on this freedom (modern)?\nAre \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;private\u0026rdquo; treated strictly as separate and distinct spheres of social life (classical) or does the reasoning work to collapse or erode the distinction between them (modern)?\nIs law understood to develop by means of \u0026ldquo;discovery\u0026rdquo; and reasoning from settled principles (classical) or by reasoning backward from the societal consequences of legal decisions (modern)?\nKeep each of these questions in mind as you read the cases we will study this year.\nDuncan Kennedy, \u0026ldquo;Three globalizations in law and legal thought, 1850–2000\u0026rdquo; in A.

(Glube C.J.N.S. concurring) — # I. Introduction # This case involves a collision of important interests. On one side, there are the interests of the respondents in the enjoyment of their privately owned land at Kingsburg Beach. On the other is the public interest in the protection and preservation of environmentally fragile and ecologically significant beach, dune and beach ridge resources. In the background of this case is the policy issue of how minutely government may control land without buying it. But in the foreground is the narrower issue of whether the stringent land use regulations applied by the Province to the respondents’ lands is an expropriation of them within the meaning of the Expropriation Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 156.\nThe respondents’ lands were designated as a beach under the Beaches Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 32. This designation brings with it a host of restrictions on the uses of and activities on the land. Pursuant to power conferred by the Act and Regulations made under it, the Minister refused to grant the respondents permission to build single family dwellings on their land. The respondents sued, claiming their lands had, in effect, been expropriated and that they were entitled to compensation. Tidman, J., at trial, found that there had been an expropriation.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the trial judge made two key findings. First, he decided that the respondents had been deprived of land within the meaning of the Expropriation Act. There were alternative bases for this finding. One basis was that the designation, on its own, was, in law, a taking of land. The alternative basis was that the taking resulted from the designation coupled with the application to the respondents’ lands of the regulatory regime flowing from the designation. These, in combination, in the judge’s view, took away virtually all of the land’s economic value and virtually extinguished all rights of ownership.\nThe second key holding by the trial judge was that the province acquired land within the meaning of the Expropriation Act because the regulation of the respondents’ lands enhanced the value of the provincially owned property from the high watermark seaward.\nIn my respectful view, the learned trial judge erred in each of these conclusions. For reasons which I will develop, my view is that the loss of economic value resulting from land use regulation is not a taking of land within the meaning of the Expropriation Act. Further, in my opinion, the respondents did not establish either the loss of virtually all rights of ownership, or that the Province had acquired any land as a result of the designation. I would, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the order of the trial judge and in its place make an order dismissing the respondents’ action.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIII. Analysis # (a) De facto Expropriation # The respondents’ claim that what was, in form, a designation of their land under the Beaches Act is, in fact, a taking of their land by a statutory authority within the meaning of the Expropriation Act. This claim of de facto expropriation, or as it is known in United States constitutional law, regulatory taking, does not have a long history or clearly articulated basis in Canadian law. We were referred to only three Canadian cases in which such a claim was made successfully, only two of which dealt with the expropriation of land.\nThe scope of claims of de facto expropriation is very limited in Canadian law. They are constrained by two governing principles. The first is that valid legislation (primary or subordinate) or action taken lawfully with legislative authority may very significantly restrict an owner’s enjoyment of private land. The second is that the Courts may order compensation for such restriction only where authorized to do so by legislation. In other words, the only questions the Court is entitled to consider are whether the regulatory action was lawful and whether the Expropriation Act entitles the owner to compensation for the resulting restrictions.\nDe facto expropriation is conceptually difficult given the narrow parameters of the Court’s authority which I have just outlined. While de facto expropriation is concerned with whether the “rights” of ownership have been taken away, those rights are defined only by reference to lawful uses of land which may, by law, be severely restricted. In short, the bundle of rights associated with ownership carries with it the possibility of stringent land use regulation.\nI dwell on this point because there is a rich line of constitutional jurisprudence on regulatory takings in both the United States and Australia which is sometimes referred to in the English and Canadian cases dealing with de facto expropriation: see for example Belfast (City) v. O.D. Cars Ltd., [1960] A.C. 490 (U.K. H.L.). The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution (which also applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment) provides that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. In the Australian Constitution, section 51(xxxi) prohibits the acquisition of property except upon just terms. While these abundant sources of case law may be of assistance in developing the Canadian law of de facto expropriation, it is vital to recognize that the question posed in the constitutional cases is fundamentally different.\nThese U.S. and Australian constitutional cases concern constitutional limits on legislative power in relation to private property. As O’Connor, J. said in the United States Supreme Court case of Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 118 S. Ct. 2131 (U.S. Mass. 1998), the purpose of the U.S. constitutional provision (referred to as the “takings clause”) is to prevent the government from “\u0026hellip; forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.” Canadian courts have no similar broad mandate to review and vary legislative judgments about the appropriate distribution of burdens and benefits flowing from environmental or other land use controls. In Canada, the courts’ task is to determine whether the regulation in question entitles the respondents to compensation under the Expropriation Act, not to pass judgment on the way the Legislature apportions the burdens flowing from land use regulation.\nIn this country, extensive and restrictive land use regulation is the norm. Such regulation has, almost without exception, been found not to constitute compensable expropriation. It is settled law, for example, that the regulation of land use which has the effect of decreasing the value of the land is not an expropriation. As expressed in Ian Rogers, Canadian Law of Planning and Zoning (looseleaf, updated to 1999) at s.5.14, “The law permits the appropriation of prospective development rights for the good of the community but allows the property owner nothing in return.” Numerous cases support this proposition including Belfast (City) v. O.D. Cars Ltd. (supra) and Calgary (City) v. Hartel Holdings Co., [1984] 1 S.C.R. 337 (S.C.C.). Many others are reviewed by Marceau, J. in Alberta (Minister of Public Works, Supply \u0026amp; Services) v. Nilsson (1999), 67 L.C.R. 1 (Alta. Q.B.) at para 35 ff. I would refer, as well, to the following from E.C.E. Todd, The Law of Expropriation in Canada, (2nd, 1992) at pp. 22-23:\nTraditionally the property concept is thought of as a bundle of rights of which one of the most important is that of user. At common law this right was virtually unlimited and subject only to the restraints imposed by the law of public and private nuisance. At a later stage in the evolution of property law the use of land might be limited by the terms of restrictive covenants.\nToday the principal restrictions on land use arise from the planning and zoning provisions of public authorities. By the imposition, removal or alteration of land use controls a public authority may dramatically increase, or decrease, the value of land by changing the permitted uses which may be made of it. In such a case, in the absence of express statutory provision to the contrary an owner is not entitled to compensation or any other remedy notwithstanding that subdivision approval or rezoning is refused or development is blocked or frozen pursuant to statutory planning powers in order, for example, to facilitate the future acquisition of the land for public purposes. “Ordinarily, in this country, the United States and the United Kingdom, compensation does not follow zoning either up or down \u0026hellip; (but) a taker may not, through the device of zoning, depress the value of property as a prelude to compulsory taking of the property for a public purpose \u0026hellip;. (emphasis added)\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn light of this long tradition of vigorous land use regulation, the test that has developed for applying the Expropriation Act to land use restrictions is exacting and, of course, the respondents on appeal as the plaintiffs at trial, had the burden of proving that they met it. In each of the three Canadian cases which have found compensation payable for de facto expropriations, the result of the governmental action went beyond drastically limiting use or reducing the value of the owner’s property. In British Columbia v. Tener, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 533 (S.C.C.), the denial of the permit meant that access to the respondents’ mineral rights was completely negated, or as Wilson, J. put it at p. 552, amounted to total denial of that interest. In Casamiro Resource Corp. v. British Columbia (Attorney General) (1991), 80 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (B.C. C.A.), which closely parallels Tener, the private rights had become “meaningless”. (1978), [1979] 1 S.C.R. 101 (S.C.C.) In Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. v. R. (1978), [1979] 1 S.C.R. 101 (S.C.C.), the legislation absolutely prohibited the claimant from carrying on its business.\nIn reviewing the de facto expropriation cases, R.J. Bauman concluded, and I agree, that to constitute a de facto expropriation, there must be a confiscation of “\u0026hellip; all reasonable private uses of the lands in question.”: R.J. Bauman, \u0026ldquo;Exotic Expropriations: Government Action and Compensation\u0026rdquo; (1994), 54 The Advocate 561 at 574. While there is no magic formula for determining (or describing) the point at which regulation ends and taking begins, I think that Marceau, J.’s formulation in Nilsson is helpful. The question is whether the regulation is of “sufficient severity to remove virtually all of the rights associated with the property holder’s interest.” (at para 48).\nConsiderations of a claim of de facto expropriation must recognize that the effect of the particular regulation must be compared with reasonable use of the lands in modern Canada, not with their use as if they were in some imaginary state of nature unconstrained by regulation. In modern Canada, extensive land use regulation is the norm and it should not be assumed that ownership carries with it any exemption from such regulation. As stated in Belfast (City), there is a distinction between the numerous “rights” (or the “bundle of rights”) associated with ownership and ownership itself. The “rights” of ownership and the concept of reasonable use of the land include regulation in the public interest falling short of what the Australian cases have called deprivation of the reality of proprietorship: see e.g. Newcrest Mining (W.A.) Ltd. v. Australia (Commonwealth) (1996), 190 C.L.R. 513 (Australia H.C.) at p. 633. In other words, what is, in form, regulation will be held to be expropriation only when virtually all of the aggregated incidents of ownership have been taken away. The extent of this bundle of rights of ownership must be assessed, not only in relation to the land’s potential highest and best use, but having regard to the nature of the land and the range of reasonable uses to which it has actually been put. It seems to me there is a significant difference in this regard between, for example, environmentally fragile dune land which, by its nature, is not particularly well-suited for residential development and which has long been used for primarily recreational purposes and a lot in a residential subdivision for which the most reasonable use is for residential construction.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n(c) Is loss of economic value loss of land under the Expropriation Act? # The trial judge found that the respondents had been deprived of land. His main conclusion appears to have been that the loss of “virtually all economic value” constituted the loss of an interest in land. He also found, however, that the “\u0026hellip; fee simple in the [respondents’] lands has been stripped of its whole bundle of rights.” Both aspects of his holding are before us in this appeal and, in my respectful view, both are in error.\nThe judge found as a fact that the plaintiffs had lost virtually all economic value of their lands. That is a question of fact. The trial judge decided to accept the evidence of the respondents’ expert, Mr. Hardy, on this point. While there was some attempt to attack it in this Court, I conclude that the finding is reasonable and supported by the evidence at trial and should not, therefore, be disturbed on appeal.\nThe judge further found that the loss of virtually all economic value was the loss of land within the meaning of the Expropriation Act. This holding contains two key elements: that the loss of all economic value is the loss of land within the meaning of the Act, and further, that the loss of virtually all economic value is a taking of land as those phrases appear in the Expropriation Act.\nI will address in this part of my reasons the first of these holdings. Does the loss of economic value of land constitute the loss of land within the meaning of the Expropriation Act?\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe important point is this. While the distinction between the value of land and interests in land is, in one sense highly technical, it is, nonetheless, deeply imbedded in the scheme of compensation provided for under the Expropriation Act. It is fundamental to the entitlement to compensation under the Act claimed by the respondents. This is so because the distinction defines the line between cases in which governmental interference with the enjoyment of land is compensable under the Act and cases in which it is not. An impressive argument may be made supporting a broader approach to compensation for governmental interference with the enjoyment of land. The logic of drawing the line based on whether an interest in land has been lost may, as noted by Wilson, J. above, be seriously questioned. Nonetheless, the Expropriation Act draws the line in this way. It is, therefore, necessary to give the legislation an interpretation consistent with the words employed and the underlying policy decision which they reflect.\nI conclude, therefore, that the learned trial judge erred in holding that the loss of virtually all economic value of the respondents’ land, was the loss of an interest in land within the meaning of the Expropriation Act.\n(d) Loss of the “bundle of rights” # That brings me to the trial judge’s holding that the effect of the designation and the way it was applied here was to strip the fee simple of its whole bundle of rights. The cases have long recognized that at a certain point, regulation is, in effect, confiscation. The law insists that the substance of the situation, not simply its form, be examined. As noted in Nilsson, restrictions on the use of land may be so stringent and all-encompassing that they have the effect of depriving the owner of his or her interest in the land, although leaving paper title undisturbed.\nWhile the decline in economic value of land is not the loss of an interest in land, it may be evidence of the loss of an interest in land. As the respondents’ appraiser, Mr. Hardy, stated in his report, the value of land is a reflection of several factors, including the scope of the incidents of ownership attached to the lands in question:\nOur consideration of the legal basis and economic factors of value in land valuation concluded that it is the rights of ownership that give land value and it is these rights that are the subject of valuation. When the rights of ownership are excessively restricted or removed, it is logical that the value of the land is diminished, destroyed or made idle.\nIt follows that, where the effect of land use regulation is to eliminate virtually all the normal incidents of ownership, this will be reflected in the market value of the land. It is not, however, the decline in market value that constitutes the loss of an interest in land, but the taking away of the incidents of ownership reflected in that decline.\nWe have been referred to only three Canadian cases in which compensation has been ordered where governmental regulatory action has been held to be a de facto expropriation: Tener, Casamiro Resource Corp. and Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. I have already reviewed these cases earlier in my reasons. Judging by these cases, de facto expropriations are very rare in Canada and they require proof of virtual extinction of an identifiable interest in land (or, in Manitoba Fisheries Ltd., of an interest in property).\nThe respondents submit that the Beaches Act and the Regulations, coupled with the refusal of Ministerial permission for development, prohibit virtually all activities normally associated with the ownership of land. The trial judge accepted this submission.\nPreclusion of residential development, as proposed by the respondents, particularly on lands of this environmental sensitivity, is not, of itself, the extinguishment of virtually all rights associated with ownership. For example, Mariner and 20102660 N.S. Limited proposed to build using standard concrete basements. In considering these applications, the Minister had before him the Jacques Whitford report which opined that standard concrete foundations would cause serious damage to the dune systems. Furthermore, it was clear on the evidence that the building of residences on two of the Moshers’ lots (i.e., the cemetery and garden lots) would not be permitted, quite apart from the Beaches Act. Yet it is not submitted that the requirements dealing with lot size and septic requirements constitute expropriation because they, in effect, prevent building residences on these lots.\nWith respect, the trial judge erred in finding that the Beaches Act designation and ensuing regulation resulted in the expropriation of these two of the Moshers’ properties. Residences could not be built on them prior to the designation, and there is no evidence that permission for other uses has been refused.\nWhat of the properties for which permission to build single family dwellings was refused? The trial judge found that virtually all incidents of ownership had been removed through that refusal and the other restrictions applied to the land. With great respect to the trial judge, I disagree.\nMany of the restricted activities may be authorized by permit. These include most of the traditional recreational uses described by Mrs. Mosher in her evidence. However, there is no evidence that a permit has been sought for any of these kinds of activities, much less refused. That being so, it is hard to follow the respondents’ argument that all of these things are prohibited. As noted earlier, it is not the requirement to obtain a permit that constrains the enjoyment of the land, but its refusal. When, as here, the claim is that the impact of a regulatory scheme has, in effect, taken away all rights of ownership, it is not the existence of the regulatory authority that is significant, but its actual application to the lands. As stated in MacDonald, Sommer \u0026amp; Frates, supra, the Court cannot determine whether regulation has gone too far unless it knows how far the regulation goes.\nThe respondents in this case proved at trial that they would not be allowed to build the proposed single family residences. With respect to three of the Mosher’s lots, there was not even an application to build; as mentioned, residential development on two of those lots was probably impossible quite apart from the designation. Some reasonable or traditional uses of this dune property may be allowed by permit. Aside from the applications to build fences, no applications for permits relating to these other uses have been made, let alone refused. The respondents had the burden of proving that virtually all incidents of ownership (having regard to reasonable uses of the land in question) have, in effect, been taken away. Neither the respondents nor the Province appear to have explored the possibility that development specifically designed in a way consistent with protection of the dunes might occur. The respondents, while asserting that all reasonable uses of the land are precluded by the operation of the Act and Regulations, have not shown that they would be denied the required permits with respect to such other reasonable or traditional uses of the lands. In short, there is an absence of evidence relating to environmentally appropriate development plans on the land in question, and an absence of evidence of refusal of permission for the respondents to engage in other reasonable or traditional uses. These, in combination, result, in my opinion, in the respondents having failed to establish that virtually all incidents of ownership have, by the effect of the Act and Regulations, been taken away.\nI would conclude, therefore, that the respondents failed to establish that they had been deprived of land within the meaning of the Expropriation Act.\n(e) Acquisition of Land # As noted, there must not only be a taking away of land from the owner but also the acquisition of land by the expropriating authority for there to be an expropriation within the meaning of the Act.\nThere is no suggestion here that the Province acquired legal title or any aspect of it. The land remains private property although subject to the regulatory regime established by the Beaches Act. The argument is that the effect of the regulatory scheme is, for practical purposes, the acquisition of an interest in land.\nThe respondents submit (and the trial judge held) that Tener stands for the proposition that where regulation enhances the value of public land, the regulation constitutes the acquisition of an interest in land. I disagree.\nIn my respectful view, Tener, is, at best, equivocal on this point. When the judgments in Tener are read in their entirety and in light of the facts of the case, there is no support for the proposition on which the respondents rely. It is clear in the judgments of both Estey, J. and Wilson, J. in Tener that what was, in effect, acquired in that case was the reversion of the mineral interests which had been granted by the Crown. Estey, J. stated that “[e]xpropriation \u0026hellip; occurs if the Crown \u0026hellip; acquires from the owner an interest in property.” He added that the acquisition of the “outstanding interest” of the respondents was a step in the establishment of the Park. He concluded that “[t]he denial of access to these lands occurred under the Park Act and amounts to a recovery by the Crown of a part of the right granted to the respondents in 1937.”In other words, the effect of the regulatory scheme was not only to extinguish the mineral rights of the respondents, but to re-vest them in the Crown. Similarly, Wilson, J. held that the effect of the denial of access was to remove an encumbrance from the Crown’s land. She stated that “\u0026hellip; what in effect has happened here is the derogation by the Crown from its grant of the mineral claims to the respondents’ predecessors in title \u0026hellip; it is nonetheless a derogation of the most radical kind one which \u0026hellip; amounts to a total denial of that interest”.\nThe respondents place great weight on comments of Estey, J. In Tener to the effect that the action taken by the government was to enhance the value of the park. These comments, while on their face supportive of the respondents’ position, must be read in the context of Estey, J.’s statements in the case that an expropriation necessarily involves the acquisition of land and that the extinguishment of the Teners’ mineral rights constituted, in effect, the re-acquisition of such rights by the Crown. I do not think, with respect, that his statements to the effect that the re-acquisition enhanced the value of the park takes away from his holding that the Crown re-acquired in fact, though not in law, the mineral rights which constituted land under the applicable definition. I am supported in this view by Wilson, J.’s unequivocal statements to similar effect with regard to the respondents’ profit à prendre.\nThe respondents also rely heavily on Manitoba Fisheries Ltd.. In my opinion, their reliance on that case is misplaced. The crucial element in that case was that the same legislative scheme that deprived the company of its goodwill also conferred a monopoly to conduct the same business on the new corporation. The Court not only held that there had been a deprivation but also, in effect, a transfer of the goodwill to the new corporation. Ritchie, J., for the Court, noted that it was conceded in that case that the legislation had resulted in depriving the company of its business; the basic contention of the Crown was that the business was not taken away by the Crown or the new corporation. This contention was rejected by the Court. At p. 468, Ritchie J stated that:\nOnce it is accepted that the loss of the goodwill of the appellant’s business which was brought about by the Act and by the setting up of the Corporation was a loss of property and that the same goodwill was by statutory compulsion acquired by the federal authority. It seems to me to follow that the appellant was deprived of property which was acquired by the Crown. (emphasis added)\nIt is true that, as the respondents submit, the goodwill did not flow to the Crown but to the new corporation. However, the new corporation was created by federal legislation as part of the monopoly scheme and was admitted to be an agent of the federal Crown: see p. 463. The Supreme Court of Canada, not surprisingly, did not draw a distinction between the corporation created by the Crown as its agent and the Crown itself in these circumstances. The crucial point, to my way of thinking, is that the asset which was, in effect, lost by Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. was the asset gained, in effect, by the new federal corporation.\nThe respondents also rely on the decision at trial in Casamiro Resource Corp. v. British Columbia (Attorney General) (1990), 43 L.C.R. 246 (B.C. S.C. [In Chambers]), at 248. The learned trial judge in that case stated, relying on Manitoba Fisheries Ltd., supra, that whether the Crown acquired the mineral rights or not was irrelevant. There is no discussion of this point in the judgment on the appeal to which I have referred above. While not doubting the result in Casamiro Resource Corp., which was upheld on appeal, this statement of the trial judge in Casamiro Resource Corp. is, with respect, clearly wrong. Contrary to what his statement suggests, for there to be an expropriation, there must be an acquisition as well as a deprivation. Moreover, the reliance on Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. for a contrary position by the trial judge in Casamiro Resource Corp. is, with respect, misplaced for the reasons I have already developed. As noted, there was in Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. an acquisition, in effect, of the goodwill by the federal authority.\nI conclude that for there to be a taking, there must be, in effect, as Estey, J. said in Tener, an acquisition of an interest in land and that enhanced value is not such an interest.\nThe respondents further submit that their lands have been effectively pressed into public service and that this is sufficient to constitute an acquisition of land. The judgment of the United States Supreme Court in Lucas v. South Carolina, 112 S. Ct. 2886 (U.S. S.C. 1992) is relied on. I do not think that case assists us here.\nThe U.S. constitutional law has, on this issue, taken a fundamentally different path than has Canadian law concerning the interpretation of expropriation legislation. In U.S. constitutional law, regulation which has the effect of denying the owner all economically beneficial or productive use of land constitutes a taking of property for which compensation must be paid. Under Canadian expropriation law, deprivation of economic value is not a taking of land, for the reasons I have set out at length earlier. It follows that U.S. constitutional law cases cannot be relied on as accurately stating Canadian law on this point. Moreover, in U.S. constitutional law, as I understand it, deprivation of property through regulation for public purposes is sufficient to bring a case within the constitutional protection against taking for “public use”, unlike the situation under the Expropriation Act which requires the taking of land. It is not, as I understand it, necessary in U.S. constitutional law to show that the state acquires any title or interest in the land regulated. For these reasons, I conclude that the U.S. takings clause cases are not of assistance in determining whether there has been an acquisition of land within the meaning of the Nova Scotia Expropriation Act.\nOn this aspect of the case, Australian constitutional law is of more assistance. As noted, s. 51 (xxxi) of the Australian Constitution prohibits the acquisition of property on other than just terms. The focus of the prohibition is on acquisition, rather than taking with the result that the Australian cases, unlike most of the U.S. takings clause cases, have addressed in detail what is required for there to be an acquisition. For example, in Australia (Commonwealth) v. Tasmania (1983), 158 C.L.R. 1 (Australia H.C.) three members of the High Court of Australia (Mason, Murphy and Brennan, JJ.) held that a federal statute which had the effect of preventing development on the land in question without the Minister’s approval, enacted to protect and conserve the land for cultural and environmental reasons, did not constitute an acquisition of property. Mason, J. at para. 70 of his reasons, put it this way:\nThe effect of s. 9, and perhaps to a lesser extent, of ss. 10 and 11, is to prevent any development of the property in question, subject to the Minister’s consent, so as to preserve its character as a wilderness area. \u0026hellip;.. In terms of its potential for use, the property is sterilized, in much the same way as a park which is dedicated to public purposes or vested in trustees for public purposes, subject, of course, to such use or development as may attract the consent of the Minister. In this sense, the property is “dedicated” or devoted to uses, that is, protection and conservation which, by virtue of Australia’s adoption of the Convention and the legislation, have become purposes of the Commonwealth. However, what is important in the present context is that neither the Commonwealth nor anyone else acquires by virtue of the legislation a proprietary interest of any kind in the property. (emphasis added)\nBrennan, J. expressed the same conclusion as follows at para. 94:\nIn the present case the Wilderness Regulations and ss. 9, 10 and 11 of the Act affect the freedom of the State of and of the HEC to use the Wild Rivers National Park and the HEC land for the construction of the proposed dam. But that is not sufficient to attract the operation of par. (xxxi). Unless proprietary rights are acquired, par. (xxxi) is immaterial to the validity of the impugned Commonwealth measures. Though the Act conferred a power upon the Minister to consent to the doing of acts which were otherwise prohibited on or in relation to land, that power was not a proprietary right. In my opinion, the Commonwealth acquired no property from Tasmania. (emphasis added)\nThese comments are particularly significant for Canadian expropriation law because the Australian High Court has found there to be an acquisition of land in a case roughly parallel to Tener. In Newcrest Mining (W.A.) Ltd. v. Australia (Commonwealth) (supra), at p. 633 the issue was whether the prohibition of mining in a national park constituted an acquisition of the appellant Newcrest’s mining leases. Justice Gummow, expressing the majority view on this issue, accepted the submission of the appellants that the state acquired “identifiable and measurable advantages” consisting of acquisition of the land “freed from the rights of Newcrest to occupy and conduct mining operations thereon.”: at pp. 69-70. Fundamental to this decision, as was the case in Tener, is that the sterilization of the mining leases, in effect, removed a limitation on the legal interest in the land which the Commonwealth owned subject to that interest. There was in Newcrest Mining (W.A.) Ltd., as in Tener, an acquisition, in effect, of some identifiable interest in land.\nReturning to the respondents’ submissions in this case, in my opinion, the freezing of development and strict regulation of the designated lands did not, of itself, confer any interest in land on the Province or any other instrumentality of government. I am reinforced in this opinion by many cases dealing with zoning and other forms of land use regulation. Estey, J., in Tener, notes that ordinarily compensation does not follow zoning either up or down. The Supreme Court of Canada in Dell Holdings Ltd., supra, accepted the general proposition that, under our law, owners caught up in the zoning or planning process, but not expropriated, must simply accept the loss (provided, of course, that the regulatory actions are otherwise lawful). Development freezes have consistently been held not to give rise to rights of compensation: for a review of the authorities, see Nilsson, supra. One of the bases of these decisions is that the restriction of development generally does not result in the acquisition of an interest in land by the regulating authority.\nThere was no evidence that the economic value of the Crown’s land was enhanced. Even if its value could be considered to be enhanced in some other sense, such enhancement, in my view, is not an acquisition of land for the purposes of the Expropriation Act.\nI conclude that the trial judge erred on this aspect of the case. In my respectful view, regulation enhancing the value of public property, if established, is not an acquisition of “land” within the meaning of the Expropriation Act.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIV. Disposition: # I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the trial judge and in its place make an order dismissing the action. The case raises several important issues which, in my view, it was in the public interest to have resolved. For that reason, I would not disturb the trial judge’s order for costs at trial and I would make no order as to costs of the appeal.\nAppeal allowed.\n"},{"id":125,"href":"/problems/market-cells/","title":"Market in Biological Cells","section":"Problems","content":" Source: Louis Reed on Unsplash\nOne or more of the arguments pairs constructed by Justice Panelli and Justice Mosk in Moore relate directly to our central question in the course regarding the relationship between law and markets.

The payment or transfer of the residue of the estate to the National Alliance is against public policy and in contradiction with Canada’s own laws, undertakings and commitments in that:\ni. The National Alliance is a long-standing neo- Nazi group in the United States that has also been active in Canada. Through its hate propaganda, the National Alliance promotes a political program parallel to that of the original World War II-era National Socialist Party of Germany (the Nazis) including genocide, ethnic cleansing, and the use of hate motivated violence and terror to achieve its aims.\nii. The National Alliance has a long history of inspiring and carrying out hate motivated violence and terror through its members and supporters in order to achieve its stated political aims;\niii. The Criminal Code of Canada specifically prohibits hate propaganda in Canada and make criminal offences of advocating genocide and publicly inciting hatred;\niv. Canada has been a signatory and party to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (\u0026ldquo;Convention\u0026rdquo;) since 1970. Parties to the Convention shall condemn all hate propaganda and declare as offences hate propaganda, membership in racial supremacist groups and the provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof;\nv.

In addition, as the applicant has pointed out, the NA’s various communications and activities contravene the values set out in the Charter of Rights, provincial human rights legislation as well as the International Conventions which Canada has signed all of which promote equality and the dignity of the person while prohibiting discrimination based on various grounds, including race and ethnic origin.\nI find that the information the NA disseminates is hate propaganda which is every bit as “malodorous, malicious and evil” as the material excerpted by Dickson, C.J. in R. v. Andrews, supra. and which is of the kind targeted by the Criminal Code which makes its dissemination illegal. It follows, therefore, and I further find, that the dissemination of it by the NA violates the public policy of Canada.\nB. Should the court declare the bequest to be invalid, given that it is made to a beneficiary whose activities are contrary to public policy, but not made for specific purposes? # The respondent and CAFE also submit that cases where the courts have struck wills down as being against public policy are limited and only involve cases where the bequest itself is objectionable such as in the case of Wishart Estate, Re, supra. They submit that the jurisprudence deals with repugnant conditions that are attached to bequests, not to the quality of the beneficiary as a person or organization. They submit that even in cases where a person has a criminal record, they are still entitled to receive a bequest, the obvious exception being where the crime, such as murder, was committed in order to obtain the bequest. On that issue see Tarnow, N.M. Unworthy Heirs: The Application of the Public Policy Rule in the Administration of Estates, (1980), 58 Can. Bar Rev. 582.\nCAFE cites the case of Bolianatz Estate v. Simon, [2006] S.J. No. 64 (Sask. C.A.) where the court refused to invalidate a gift to a beneficiary who had been stealing from the testator prior to the testator’s death. In that case Richards, J.A., in separate but concurring reasons, stated at paragraphs 58 \u0026amp; 59:\n… the general orientation of the law is very much against involving the courts in superintending the question of whether particular beneficiaries merit their inheritances. Bequests are not denied because a beneficiary is of bad character, has behaved immorally or has been involved in criminal activity.\nIn terms of general principle, this recommends itself as a sound approach. It fits with the basic assumption that individuals are entitled to dispose of their property as they see fit. It promotes certainty and efficiency in the handling of wills by avoiding costly and protracted disputes over the proper allocation of testators’ assets. And finally, it recognizes and avoids the deep problems involved in attempting to identify the particular kinds of behavior which should deny an inheritance.\nThey also rely on Jake Estate v. Antelman, 2006 NBQB 371 (N.B. Q.B.) where Creaghan, J. refused to void a gift as being against public policy. In that case, he stated at paragraph 22:\nAlthough it may be argued that policies of the State of Israel are not in total conformity with policy of Canada as the country where the Will was executed and with whose law the validity of the Will must conform, I cannot find any basis for finding that a testamentary gift to the Government of Israel is contrary to public policy.\nCAFE submits that there is nothing objectionable within the bequest itself. The only objection lies, they submit, within the applicant’s perception of the beneficiary and that it should not be interfered with.\nThey further submit that the gift merely expresses Mr. McCorkill’s desire to benefit the National Alliance. There is no evidence, they submit, that the gift contains any conditions or connotation of violence. In that regard, they rely on Section 2 of the Charter of Rights which guarantees freedom of speech. They further submit that if a testamentary gift is not subject to any conditions which call for a use that is against public policy then the court should not interfere with the testator’s right or freedom to dispose of his estate as he sees fit.\nThey further submit that if the court intervenes it will open the floodgates to frivolous estate litigation. They submit that the certainty which has long been associated with testamentary bequests and which has served the English common law tradition so well will be eroded if courts intervene in cases where the character and/or quality of the beneficiary is challenged because that, they submit, is irrelevant.\nThey further submit that since Mr. McCorkill would have been entitled to give money to the National Alliance while he was alive, there should be no reason he cannot do so on his death.\nFinally, the respondent submits that there is no evidence before the Court that if the will is upheld the National Alliance will use the money against any minority groups. They support CAFE’s submissions and, in particular, submit that voiding this bequest would set a dangerous precedent.\nAnalysis and Decision # While the jurisprudence on voiding bequests on the grounds of public policy tends to deal with conditions attached to specific bequests, in my opinion the facts of this case are so strong that they render this case indistinguishable from those.\nUnlike most beneficiaries, the National Alliance has foundational documents which state its purposes. Moreover, those purposes have been expanded upon, explained and disseminated in various forms of media by the NA since its inception. They consistently show that the National Alliance stands for principles and policies, as well as the means to implement them, that are both illegal and contrary to public policy in Canada. If the organization has changed in these respects since its inception then it was incumbent upon the respondent, particularly through the evidence of Erich Gliebe, the current President of the National Alliance, to demonstrate that in this application. It has not done so.\nThe facts of this case can be distinguished from most other cases because in most cases, a beneficiary of an estate does not “stand for” something identifiable. They don’t have foundational documents. A drug dealer does not “stand for” dealing drugs. He or she may have a criminal record of doing that but that does not mean that that is what they stand for. Their crimes are not the purpose for which they exist, their raison d’être.\nUnlike in the Jake Estate case, supra., where there was no finding by the court that the State of Israel’s raison d’être was contrary to public policy in Canada, in this case it is abundantly clear that what the National Alliance stands for and has stood for since its inception, its raison d’être, is contrary to public policy in Canada. In fact, as mentioned earlier, what it stands for, anti-semitism, eugenics, discrimination, racism and white supremacy, violates numerous statutes and conventions that have been passed by Parliament and the Legislatures and endorsed by the Government of Canada, including the Criminal Code.\nThe evidence before the court convinces me that in the case of the NA the purpose for which it exists is to promote white supremacy through the dissemination of propaganda which incites hatred of various identifiable groups which they deem to be non-white and therefore unworthy. Those purposes and the means they advocate to achieve them are criminal in Canada and that is what makes this bequest repugnant.\nIt is also what makes this situation comparable, in my view, to a gift to a trustee for a purpose that is contrary to public policy. The law of wills is concerned with the intent of the testator and from the very fact that Mr. McCorkill left his entire estate to the NA I infer that he intended it to be used for their clearly stated, illegal purposes. For me to find that such a gift was valid would require that I ignore an overwhelming body of evidence. The Court of Appeal has made the point on more than one occasion that trial judges must not “check their common sense at the court room door”. Allowing this bequest to stand because it doesn’t repeat those stated purposes but bestows the bequest on the organization whose very existence is dedicated to achieving them would be doing just that, in my view.\n[…]\nCAFE further submits that decisions such as this dealing with public policy should be left to Parliament and the Legislatures and that the courts should not interfere. (See also para. 59, supra.) That submission ignores the fact that Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly on this very subject in s. 319(2) of the Criminal Code as well as the fact that the New Brunswick Legislature has enacted the Human Rights Act, R.S.N.B. 1973 c. H-11, the preamble to which states, in part:\nWhereas recognition of the fundamental principle that all persons are equal in dignity and human rights without regard to race, colour, religion, national origin, ancestry, place of origin, age, physical disability, mental disability, marital status, sexual orientation, sex, social condition or political belief or activity is a governing principle sanctioned by the laws of New Brunswick; \u0026hellip;\nThat submission also might have carried more weight if, in this case, the Attorney General had not intervened. However, the Attorney General has intervened and clearly stated the position of the government that this bequest is in violation of the public policy of this province and should be voided. It would not be practical for legislatures to pass legislation dealing with individual wills. An intervention such as this by the Attorney General is the only practical way for a government to deal with a particular case in order to ensure that the principles set out in legislation such as the Human Rights Act, supra., are upheld. That intervention sends a strong message about the effect of this bequest on the public policy of this province.\nCAFE also submits that since Mr. McCorkill was legally permitted to donate money to the NA during his lifetime there is no compelling legal argument for prohibiting him from doing so on his death. I don’t accept the premise of that submission. He may have been able to donate to the NA during his lifetime but I absolutely reject the submission that it was legal for him to assist an organization in the dissemination of hate propaganda. As mentioned earlier the NA’s activities offend section 319(2) of the Criminal Code and, as a contributor, he would have been a party to that offence.\nMoreover, even if the bequest were not illegal but violated public policy for other reasons, the court could still void it. In Egerton v. Earl of Brownlow (1853), 10 E.R. 359 (U.K. H.L.) the Lord Chief Baron discussed this in the following passage at p. 417:\n… The owner of an estate may himself do many things which he could not (by a condition) compel his successor to do. One example is sufficient. He may leave his land uncultivated, but he cannot by a condition compel his successor to do so. The law does not interfere with the owner and compel him to cultivate his land (though it be for the public good that land should be cultivated) so far the law respects ownership; but when, by a condition, he attempts to compel his successor to do what is against the public good, the law steps in and pronounces the condition void, \u0026hellip;\nThus, in this case if the right of free speech in Canada were unfettered by the Criminal Code and Mr. McCorkill could have legally donated to the NA while he was living, this court would still have the authority, on making a finding that the bequest violates public policy, to step in and declare it void. See also Fox v. Fox Estate [1996 CarswellOnt 317 (Ont. C.A.)] 1996 CanLii 779 at p. 11.\nMr. Streed also submits that there is no evidence before the court that the NA will use the bequest for any purposes that violate public policy such as inciting hatred against Jewish people and other identifiable minorities. The answer to that submission is found in the foundational documents of the NA which demonstrate that it is dedicated to precisely that and related purposes as the means of achieving white supremacy, white living space and its other racist goals. The fact that it may use some of the bequest to pay someone to clean its office premises or to fund a cultural festival does not mean that the bequest is used for other purposes. All of its activities are clearly focused on achieving its core purposes and thus any money it spends, from whatever source or for any activity, contributes, either directly or indirectly, to achieving those purposes.\nFinally, CAFE and the respondent submit that if the Court intervenes and voids the bequest because of the nature of the beneficiary then the floodgates will be open and estate litigation will flourish where bequests are left to persons who are not of stellar character. In my view, there is little risk of that. Each case must be dealt with on its own merits and I have little doubt that the expense of litigation will discourage frivolous applications. It is difficult to imagine too many applications that would be based on such a strong factual background as this one. On the contrary, in my view, if the court allowed this bequest to stand it would increase the risk of opening the door to bequests to other criminal organizations.\nMoreover, the jurisprudence concerning cases that are contrary to public policy goes back 200 years in the English common law tradition and more than a century in Canada alone. Despite that long history, it can hardly be said that there has been a deluge of cases where the courts have intervened in an estate or trust or even a contract on the grounds of public policy.\nI therefore find that while the voiding of a bequest based on the character of the beneficiary is, and will continue to be, an unusual remedy, where, as here, the beneficiary’s raison d’être is contrary to public policy, it is the appropriate remedy.\nDisposition # In summary, I find that the purposes of the National Alliance and the activities and communications which it undertakes to promote its purposes are both illegal in Canada and contrary to the public policy of both Canada and New Brunswick. Consequently, I declare the residual bequest to it in the will of Harry Robert McCorkill to be void.

From one perspective, these waterways were akin to other types of public infrastructure (like roads and railways) necessary for rapidly expanding natural resource extraction and, eventually, industrialization. In 1847, provincial legislation was passed to help ensure access to waterways in Upper Canada by lumber workers. The legislation stated that:1\nAll persons may float saw logs and other timber, rafts and craft down all streams in Upper Canada during the spring, summer, and autumn freshets, and no person shall, by felling trees or placing any other obstruction in or across any such stream prevent the passage thereof.\n(Here, the term \u0026ldquo;freshets\u0026rdquo; refers to the flood of a river or stream due to heavy rain or melted snow).\nA question of interpretation surrounding this provision made its way before the courts in Upper Canada in a case called Boale v Dickson, decided in 1863. In Boale, the court held that the provision above applied only to watercourses that allowed timber to be floated down them \u0026ldquo;in their natural state…without improvements\u0026rdquo;. Crucially, this meant that the legislation was found not apply to non-navigable rivers where riparian owners had made them navigable exclusively by installing their own improvements.\nA few decades later, after the provision above was reenacted by the Province of Ontario, the decision in Boale v Dickson was challenged when the company of Boyd Caldwell \u0026amp; Son sought to float logs down waterways belonging to the lumber merchant Peter McLaren—waterways which McLaren had made navigable only by investing heavily in costly improvements to make them passable.\nIn 1880, McLaren persuaded the Ontario Court of Chancery to grant an injunction\u0026ndash;based on the ruling in Boale\u0026ndash;restraining Caldwell from using the rivers where McLaren had made improvements. In Caldwell\u0026rsquo;s appeal of the decision, the Ontario Court of Appeal overruled Boale and overturned the injunction. Eventually, this decision by Ontario Court of Appeal interpreting the 1847 Act was overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada (but then ultimately upheld by the Privy Council).\nMeanwhile, following the Chancery Counrt\u0026rsquo;s decision granting McLaren his initial injunction, the provincial legislature in Ontario attempted to intervene in the dispute by enacting legislation in 1881 entitled the Rivers and Streams Act. This new legislation attempted to clarify\u0026ndash;contra Boale and the position of the Supreme Court\u0026ndash;that parties in Caldwell\u0026rsquo;s position did indeed have the right to use rivers like McLaren\u0026rsquo;s and their associated improvements, even if they were non-navigable to begin with.\nAfter the Rivers and Streams Act was enacted by Ontario in 1881, McLaren successfully petitioned the federal government to take the extraordinary step of unilaterally \u0026ldquo;disallowing\u0026rdquo; the new provincial legislation on the basis that it unduly interfered with McLaren\u0026rsquo;s property rights. In the two years following this move by the federal Conservatives in Parliament, the Rivers and Streams Act was twice reintroduced by the province, with the federal government disallowing the legislation each time. The Act finally passed the Ontario legislature, without disallowance, in 1884.\nAt the heart of this remarkable series of events was the issue of how Ontario\u0026rsquo;s attempts to support the transportation of lumber by modifying traditional rights to property in watercourses ought to be framed and interpreted in law. In other words, should provincial limitations on McLaren\u0026rsquo;s rights to exclude others from using the river be viewed by the courts as an expropriation? And if so, what are the legal consequences of such an interpretation?\nBelow are excerpts from the judgments of the Ontario Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada in McLaren v Caldwell, linked in turn to readings about the Rivers and Streams Act and the federal Parliamentary debates described above. As in previous weeks, we are interested in how the features of classical common law thought are influencing the decisions and the rhetoric in these cases\u0026ndash;here, decisions taken in both the judicial and political spheres.\nOntario Court of Appeal (Spragge, C.J.O) # The plaintiff describes himself in his bill as a lumber merchant, timber dealer, sawmiller, and lumberman, and states that the defendant carries on the same branches of business. The bill enumerates some twelve parcels of land, of which it is stated that the plaintiff is owner; and it states that he is owner also of large tracts of timber. The bill goes on to allege that the streams flowing through his parcels of land were not navigable streams, \u0026ldquo;nor floatable for logs and timber,\u0026rdquo; while in the crown, nor until after the improvements set forth in the bill were made on the said streams by the plaintiff; and that in their natural and unimproved state they would not, even during freshets, permit of saw-logs or timber being floated down the same, but were useless for the purpose. And in the 10th paragraph the plaintiff thus states his rights: \u0026ldquo;The plaintiff is entitled, both as riparian proprietor and as owner in fee simple of the bed of the said streams, where they pass and flow through the said lots respectively, to the absolute, exclusive, and uninterrupted user of the said streams for all purposes not forbidden by law, and amongst other purposes, to the absolute and exclusive right to the user of the same for the purpose of floating or driving saw-logs and timber down the same.\u0026rdquo; He then goes on to say that on various parts of the said streams which run and flow through lands therein described, the plaintiff and those through whom he claims have expended a large amount of money in making certain specific and very valuable improvements, which he sets out in a number of the subsequent paragraphs of the bill.\nThe complaint is, in substance, that the defendants, having got out several thousand saw-logs, threaten and intend to avail themselves of the improvements set out in the bill; and that in floating and running the timber and logs down the stream they are interfering with and obstructing the plaintiff in floating and running down his timber and saw-logs. And he takes the ground, that the defendants in so doing are wrongfully and forcibly, and without right or colour of right, making use of the improvements made by the plaintiff and those under whom he claims, and of which the plaintiff is entitled to the exclusive and uninterrupted user.\nEvidence was given at great length before Proudfoot, V. C. That learned Judge considered that he ought to follow the case of Boale v. Dickson, 13 C. P. 337, and stated that he understood that case to determine that if any improvements are necessary to render streams floatable, the statute G. S. IJ. C. ch. 48, does not apply—that it does not alter the character of the private streams, and that the owner of the land over which the stream flows has the right to prevent intrusion upon it. Upon the evidence, he came to the conclusion that without the artificial means of which evidence was given, neither of the streams upon which improvements had been made by the plaintiff could be considered floatable, even in freshets or high water.\nThat was the issue upon which the evidence in the cause was given, and that was the proper issue if the construction placed upon the statute ia Boale v. Dickson was the proper construction.\nUpon the appeal to this Court, it is contended that the construction placed upon the statute in Boale v. Dickson, was not correct. It becomes our duty, therefore, to consider and determine that question.\nIt is obvious, from a perusal of the Acts, (which are consolidated in ch. 48 of the C. S. U. C.,) that it was the policy of the legislature to encourage the lumber trade of the province, and to preserve the fish in the streams. [\u0026hellip;]\nThen, in section 5 of the same Act, we find enacted what is embodied in sections 15 and 16 of the Consolidated Act. The first clause of section 5 is in the same terms as section 15, beginning thus,—\u0026ldquo;And be it enacted that it shall be lawful for all persons to float saw-logs,\u0026rdquo; (and so to the end of section 15) \u0026ldquo;and other timber, rafts, and craft, down all streams in Upper Canada during the spring, summer, and autumn freshets; and that no person shall, by felling trees or placing any other obstruction in or across any such stream, prevent the passage thereof.\u0026rdquo;\nIn Boale v. Dickson the opinion is expressed, \u0026ldquo;that this right so given extends only to such streams as in their natural state will, without improvements, during freshets permit saw-logs, timber, etc, to be floated down them; to streams of a different class to those mentioned in the 3rd section, \u0026lsquo;down which lumber is usually brought.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\nNo such qualification of the right given by section 15 is to be found in the Act, nor in any of the previous Acts thereby consolidated. There is nothing in the context of any of these Acts shewing or tending to shew that such qualification was intended; and we know, from what we find in the evidence taken in this cause, that confining the right given by section 15 to such streams as are described in the passage I have quoted from Boale, v. Dickson, would go far to defeat the avowed policy of the Legislature. Evidence was offered that in none of the streams in the province, in their natural state, at the date of the passing of these Acts, could saw-logs, timber, \u0026amp;c, be floated down without improvements, even during freshets. The evidence was stopped by the learned Vice-Chancellor upon the objection of the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s counsel after some evidence in that direction had been given. But from the evidence that was given in the cause, it is apparent that if section 15 is to be read with the qualification given to it by Boale v. Dickson, a very large number of the streams of the province would be excluded from its operation.\n[…]\n[Based on the observations above, the Court of Appeal concluded that the legislative provisions under consideration could not be interpreted to include the qualification given to it by the court\u0026rsquo;s decision in Boale, and therefore Boale could not operate to exclude from the reach of the legislation \u0026ldquo;the very large number of streams\u0026rdquo; noted above\u0026ndash;including, of course, the stream on which McLaren had built his improvements.]\nAppeal allowed.\nSupreme Court of Canada (Ritchie C.J.) # The bill in this case was filed in the Court of Chancery on the 4th May, 1880, on behalf of the appellant, Peter McLaren, against the respondents, B. Caldwell \u0026amp; Son, to restrain them passing or floating timber and saw logs through portions of the main branch of the Mississippi river and its northern tributaries, Louse creek and Buckshot creek, where these streams passed and flowed through the lands of the appellant and over the dams, slides, and improvements owned or constructed by the appellant along these streams.\nVice-Chancellor Proudfoot, on the 4th of May, granted an ex parte injunction to the plaintiff (appellant), and on the 21st day of May, 1880, continued the injunction until the hearing of the cause.\nFrom this decision the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal, and on the 2nd of June, 1880, by a judgment of that court, the injunction granted was dissolved. The defendants thereupon answered the plaintiff’s bill in the usual course on the 11th of August, 1880. Replication was filed on the 3rd of September, 1880.\nThe cause came on for examination of witnesses and hearing before Vice-Chancellor Proudfoot, at Brockville, on the 27th of October, 1880, and afterwards at Perth, on the 8th of December, 1880, and was continued until the 16th of December, on which day the Vice-Chancellor pronounced a decree in favour of the appellant.\nFrom this decree the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and their appeal was allowed.\nFrom this decision the plaintiff now appeals to this court.\nAt the time the bill was filed the respondents were proceeding to drive their logs, in all some 18,000 logs, through all the appellants improvements on Louse creek and Buckshot creek, and on the Mississippi, all of which flow through the lots of land of which the appellant was, and still is, the owner in fee simple.\nThe plaintiff contends that the stream in question where it passes through his property is non-navigable, and non-floatable at all seasons of the year — that he has, by artificial means placed on his own property, enabled lumber to float over his property through the course of said stream, and the main question at issue between the parties is this: Has the appellant the legal right to prevent (as he seeks by his bill to do) the respondents driving their logs through his lands, and in doing so to utilize the improvements owned by him, on and along the streams in question? Or, are those streams part of the public highway, and, therefore, open to the free use of the respondents in common with the appellant and the public generally?\nIt cannot be disputed, I think, that if those portions of the streams in which plaintiff’s improvements were made, are incapable of being navigated or floated at any time of the year, and the fee simple of the beds of such streams is in plaintiff, the public at common law have no right whatever to enter on such private property, and plaintiff, having the absolute title to the same, has the sole right to deal with the bed and soil of the stream, and to place such improvements, constructions and erections thereon as he may choose. While it seems to be admitted that the public have no right to enter on such property and make improvements thereon, it is claimed that in Ontario, when streams of the character mentioned are rendered capable of being navigated through the instrumentality of such improvements made by the owner of the soil, whereby lumber can at freshet times be floated through private property, the public have an absolute common law right to use such improvements and to deal with the stream, as if the same had been naturally floatable, that is, without the aid of artificial improvements; and this right it is also claimed, is conferred on the public by virtue of the statutory enactments of the Province of Ontario.\nThe Act 12 Vic., cap. 87, is entitled, “An Act to amend an Act passed in the Parliament of Upper Canada in the ninth year of the reign of his late Majesty King George the Fourth, entitled ‘An Act to provide for the construction of aprons to mill dams over certain streams in this Province, and to make further provision in respect thereof.’”\nSection 5 of this Act is in the following words:\nAnd be it enacted that it shall be lawful for all persons to float saw logs and other timber rafts and craft down all streams in Upper Canada during the spring, summer and autumn freshets; and that no person shall, by felling trees, or placing any other obstruction in, or across such stream, prevent the passage thereof; provided always that no person using such stream, in manner and for the purposes aforesaid, shall alter, injure or destroy any dam or other useful erection in, or upon the bed, of or across any such stream, or do any unnecessary damage thereto or on the banks of such stream; provided there shall be a convenient apron, slides, gate, lock or opening in any such dam or other structure made for the passage of all saw logs and other timber rafts and crafts authorized to be floated down such streams as aforesaid.\nThe Act 12 Vic. c. 87, remained in force until 1859, when it was repealed by Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, at page 462.\nIt was, however, substantially re-enacted during the same year as chapter 48 of the Consolidated Statutes of Upper Canada, of which Act the above section 5 is made to comprise sections 15 and 16. This Act is intituled “An Act respecting mills and mill dams.” Section 15 of chapter 48 is as follows: —\nAll persons may float saw logs and other timber, rafts and craft down all streams in Upper Canada during the spring, summer, and autumn freshets, and no person shall, by felling trees or placing any other obstruction in or across any such stream prevent the passage thereof.\nThere can be no doubt that statutes which encroach on the rights of the subject, whether as regards persons or property, should receive a strict construction, and if a reasonable doubt remains, which cannot be satisfactorily solved, the subject is entitled to the benefit of the doubt, in other words he shall not be injured or affected in his person or property, unless the intention of the Legislature to interfere with the one or take away the other is clearly and unequivocally indicated.\nAt the very outset, if defendants’ contention can be maintained, we are met with the singular incongruity of the Legislature enacting that “it shall be lawful for all persons to float saw logs and other timber rafts and crafts down,” or “that all persons may float saw logs and other timber rafts and crafts down” streams that from the nature of the streams themselves it is impossible saw logs, etc., could be floated down; in other words it seems most unreasonable to suppose that the Legislature intended to legislate that it should be lawful to do what in the nature of things could not be done. Is it not much more reasonable to assume that the Legislature was dealing with a subject-matter capable of being used in the manner in which it is declared it shall be lawful to use it, and that in this view the language of the Legislature had reference to all streams on or through which saw logs and other timber, etc., could either during the spring, summer or autumn freshets be floated?\nThe object of the Legislature was, in my opinion, in the interest of the timber business, not to interfere with or take away any private right, but to settle by statutory declaration any doubt that might exist as to streams incapable of being navigated by boats, but capable of floating property, such as saw logs and timber, only at certain seasons of the year, viz.: during spring, summer, or autumn freshets; thereby classing such streams as public highways, by adopting a test of navigability judicially recognized and acted on in the Province of New Brunswick, as far back as 1842, and in some, though not in all, of the American States, as applicable to the circumstances and necessities of this country, and which circumstances do not exist in England, where no such test prevails, thus affirming and settling a new and debatable point, viz.: the right of the public to float timber, \u0026amp;c., down streams floatable only in freshet times, and the Legislature having thus established the right proceeded to prevent the obstruction of the same; but, nevertherless, subject always to the restrictions imposed in respect to erections for milling purposes on such streams, and the action of the Legislature was not intended to interfere with private property and private rights in streams not by nature floatable at any season of the year.\nIf the Legislature contemplated what is now contended for, and intended the enactment to apply to streams not-floatable at all seasons, as there is no pretence for saying that the Legislature has conferred any right on the public to enter on private property on any such non-floatable streams, and make it floatable, and as a non-floatable stream cannot be made practically floatable by operation of law, what was the specific legal right conferred on the public by the statute? Is it not obvious that the only effect of the enactment could be to confer on the public the right to use private property and the improvements made thereon by the proprietors thereof without making any compensation therefor? From this section is it possible to infer any such intention? Had any such intention been present to the mind of the Legislature it should have been, and I think it would have been, clearly and unequivocally expressed. To attribute to the Legislature an intention so unreasonable and unjust is not justifiable unless the language is so direct and unambiguous as to admit of no doubt or other construction.\nI am at a loss to appreciate the force of the illustration given by Mr. Justice Patterson of the statutory highways of Ontario, as being at all analogous to the case of non-floatable streams. It seems entirely to beg the question. No doubt, if the Legislature had, in so many words, declared all streams, whether or not navigable or floatable, common or public highways, then doubtless the improvements or the removal of obstructions on such common or public highways, could in no way interfere with their common and public character. But this leaves us just where we were, and in no way that I can see solves the question we have to determine, viz.: whether or not the Legislature has so declared streams not floatable, public highways. It may so happen, and no doubt has happened, that in grants of land, allowances for roads therein dedicated as highways, on actual survey, and on the laying out of the roads, have proved, from the natural character of the ground, impassable as highways. But it is clear that any such case must be exceptional and accidental.\nIt cannot, I think, be supposed that the Legislature would, knowingly, dedicate by law, over private property, common and public highways, which could never be used as such by reason of the land being by nature totally unfit for and impassable as a highway. On the same principal, it seems to me as equally unreasonable to suppose that the Legislature intended simply to declare it lawful for all persons to float sawlogs down streams in freshet times, through which, at such times, no logs could by any possibility be floated. I am likewise quite at a loss to understand how such a mere declaration, impossible to be acted on, could encourage the lumber trade or afford any facilities to parties engaged in the lumber trade in conveying their rafts to market.\nThen as to the right to use the improvements of a proprietor by which he has made the stream floatable. The proprietor of a non-floatable stream who makes it floatable for his own use, does no more than if he made a canal through his property. He does not interfere with his neighbour; he takes nothing from the public, who can neither use the stream as it is, nor improve it, except by the permission of the proprietor, and as to whom, having no right or property therein, the improvement of the proprietor does no wrong, and who are placed in no worse position by the owner’s refusal to permit them to be used than they were in if no such improvement had been made.\nIt has been urged that to allow an individual to shut up a stream a hundred miles long because he may own small portions of the stream not floatable in a state of nature would be most unreasonable. But it seems to be forgotten that it is not the individual who shuts up the stream, it is closed by natural impediments which prevent such portions being used for floatable purposes, and as it is admitted the public have no right to enter on such portions and erect improvements whereby the stream in those parts may be made navigable or floatable by reason of the same being private property, the stream is as effectually shut up by a refusal to permit an entry and improvements to be made as if the proprietor himself made the improvements and prohibited the use thereof by the public. If the use of the non-floatable portions of a stream is as necessary for the carrying on of lumbering operations as has been urged, the obvious means of securing a right to use private improvements would be to obtain by payment of an adequate consideration the proprietor’s permission, or, if the streams are unimproved, to secure from the proprietor the privilege of making such necessary improvements, or, failing the ability to accomplish this, if the development of the public domain, the exigencies of the public, or the business of the country, is of such paramount importance in comparison with individual loss or inconvenience as to require that private rights should give way to the public necessity, the remedy must be sought at the hands of the legislature through the instrumentality of expropriation, with suitable and full compensation under and by virtue of the right of eminent domain. There is, in my opinion, nothing whatever to justify the conclusion that the legislature intended under this provision to exercise its right of eminent domain, and expropriate the property of the owners of streams not by nature navigable or floatable, or any property or improvements the owner might place or make thereon.\nBut, in my opinion, as I have suggested, the Legislature merely intended that all streams through which lumber could pass, whether all the year round, or only during the freshet times, should, for the purposes of the lumber trade, be common and public highways, but did not intend thereby to enact that streams through which lumber could not pass, even in times of freshets, should be common and public highways, still less that sluiceways and improvements on private property, through which, in its natural state, lumber could not be passed, should become subject to public uses any more than a canal or railroad dug or constructed on private property round a natural obstruction.\n[…]\nAppeal allowed.\nAn act to provide for the construction of aprons to mill dams over certain streams in this Province, and to make further provision in respect thereof (1849), 12 Vict, c 87, s 5.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":128,"href":"/casebook/governance/metalclad/","title":"Metalclad Corporation v The United Mexican States","section":"Chapter 2","content":" The Tribunal — # C. NAFTA, Article 1110: Expropriation # NAFTA Article 1110 provides that “[n]o party shall directly or indirectly … expropriate an investment … or take a measure tantamount to … expropriation … except: (a) for a public purpose; (b) on a non- discriminatory basis; (c) in accordance with due process of law and Article 1105(1); and (d) on payment of compensation …” “A measure” is defined in Article 201(1) as including “any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice”.\nThus, expropriation under NAFTA includes not only open, deliberate and acknowledged takings of property, such as outright seizure or formal or obligatory transfer of title in favour of the host State, but also covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.\nBy permitting or tolerating the conduct of Guadalcazar in relation to Metalclad which the Tribunal has already held amounts to unfair and inequitable treatment breaching Article 1105 and by thus participating or acquiescing in the denial to Metalclad of the right to operate the landfill, notwithstanding the fact that the project was fully approved and endorsed by the federal government, Mexico must be held to have taken a measure tantamount to expropriation in violation of NAFTA Article 1110(1).\nThe Tribunal holds that the exclusive authority for siting and permitting a hazardous waste landfill resides with the Mexican federal government. This finding is consistent with the testimony of the Secretary of SEMARNAP and, as stated above, is consistent with the express language of the LGEEPA.\nAs determined earlier (see above, para 92), the Municipality denied the local construction permit in part because of the Municipality’s perception of the adverse environmental effects of the hazardous waste landfill and the geological unsuitability of the landfill site. In so doing, the Municipality acted outside its authority. As stated above, the Municipality’s denial of the construction permit without any basis in the proposed physical construction or any defect in the site, and extended by its subsequent administrative and judicial actions regarding the Convenio, effectively and unlawfully prevented the Claimant’s operation of the landfill.\nThese measures, taken together with the representations of the Mexican federal government, on which Metalclad relied, and the absence of a timely, orderly or substantive basis for the denial by the Municipality of the local construction permit, amount to an indirect expropriation.\nThe present case resembles in a number of pertinent respects that of Biloune, et al. v. Ghana Investment Centre, et al., 95 I.L.R.183, 207-10 (1993) (Judge Schwebel, President; Wallace and Leigh, Arbitrators). In that case, a private investor was renovating and expanding a resort restaurant in Ghana. As with Metalclad, the investor, basing itself on the representations of a government affiliated entity, began construction before applying for a building permit. As with Metalclad, a stop work order was issued after a substantial amount of work had been completed. The order was based on the absence of a building permit. An application was submitted, but although it was not expressly denied, a permit was never issued. The Tribunal found that an indirect expropriation had taken place because the totality of the circumstances had the effect of causing the irreparable cessation of work on the project. The Tribunal paid particular regard to the investor’s justified reliance on the government’s representations regarding the permit, the fact that government authorities knew of the construction for more than one year before issuing the stop work order, the fact that permits had not been required for other projects and the fact that no procedure was in place for dealing with building permit applications. Although the decision in Biloune does not bind this Tribunal, it is a persuasive authority and the Tribunal is in agreement with its analysis and its conclusion.\nAlthough not strictly necessary for its conclusion, the Tribunal also identifies as a further ground for a finding of expropriation the Ecological Decree issued by the Governor of SLP on September 20, 1997. This Decree covers an area of 188,758 hectares within the “Real de Guadalcazar” that includes the landfill site, and created therein an ecological preserve. This Decree had the effect of barring forever the operation of the landfill.\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded by Mexico’s representation to the contrary. The Ninth Article, for instance, forbids any work inconsistent with the Ecological Decree’s management program. The management program is defined by the Fifth Article as one of diagnosing the ecological problems of the cacti reserve and of ensuring its ecological preservation. In addition, the Fourteenth Article of the Decree forbids any conduct that might involve the discharge of polluting agents on the reserve soil, subsoil, running water or water deposits and prohibits the undertaking of any potentially polluting activities. The Fifteenth Article of the Ecological Decree also forbids any activity requiring permits or licenses unless such activity is related to the exploration, extraction or utilization of natural resources.\nThe Tribunal need not decide or consider the motivation or intent of the adoption of the Ecological Decree. Indeed, a finding of expropriation on the basis of the Ecological Decree is not essential to the Tribunal’s finding of a violation of NAFTA Article 1110. However, the Tribunal considers that the implementation of the Ecological Decree would, in and of itself, constitute an act tantamount to expropriation.\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal holds that Mexico has indirectly expropriated Metalclad’s investment without providing compensation to Metalclad for the expropriation. Mexico has violated Article 1110 of the NAFTA.\n"},{"id":129,"href":"/casebook/relationships/mikmaw-land-tenure/","title":"Mi'kmaw Land Tenure","section":"Chapter 1","content":"The Court in Syliboy deployed each of the core themes of colonialism in property law we introduced in Week 1 in order to interpret the 1752 Peace and Friendship Treaty. The Syliboy decision provided a deeply problematic footing on which to set the common law\u0026rsquo;s understanding of treaty rights and in some significant ways tracked the developing common law doctrine of Aboriginal title. But despite the Syliboy decision\u0026rsquo;s long influence on treaty interpretation in Mi\u0026rsquo;kma\u0026rsquo;ki, in its aftermath Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw jurists continued to offer alternative interpretations grounded in the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw legal order and worldview.\nJames (Sa’ke’j) Youngblood Henderson explains Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw law in the context of treaty in the following way:1\nThe prerogative Treaties enabled the two worldviews and different societies to make a new normative world using the irony of jurisdictions, obligations and rights. To live in the new legal world required each culture to know not only the meaning of the alliance and its terms, but also the connections or transformations that resulted when one normative system passed through another. The prerogative Treaties constructed, through mutual consent, a new normative system out of the various constructions of reality and visions of what the world might be.\nFor example, the Wabanaki and Mikmaq applied the customary concept of harmony and forgiveness to the English. Specifically, article 2 of the Mikmaw Compact, 1752, stated that \u0026ldquo;all Transactions during the Late War on both sides be buried in Oblivion with the Hatchet.\u0026rdquo; This fragile quest for an explicit order between the diverse federations through consensual Treaties provided the foundation upon which developed the first British Empire and their colonies, and eventually the United Kingdom.\nProfessor Youngblood Henderson goes on to describe Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq relationships to land:\nThe relationship between the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw and the land embodies the essence of the intimate sacred order. As humans, they have and retain an obligation to protect the order and a right to share its uses, but only the future unborn children in the invisible sacred realm of the next seven generations had any ultimate ownership of the land. In the custom of the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq, the Santé Mawi\u0026rsquo;omi was and is the trustee of the sacred order and territory for the future generations. Part of its duty is to regulate the natural resources of Mi\u0026rsquo;kma\u0026rsquo;ki among the allied people and through the Nikmanen trading customs increase the bio-diversity. This is more of a management right to ensure discipline in consumption of the resources, rather than the concept of ownership.\nInherent in this sacred order is the conviction that the resources had to be renewed as well as shared. Rather than managed, which implied human domination, the Mikmaq developed rituals for sharing or harmonizing the human and spiritual realms. These renewal rituals and ceremonies brought the people and the land into balance thereby achieving basic subsistence and material well-being. These rituals and ceremonies created a harmony which emphasized stability and the minimization of risk for the harvesting of the resources rather than growth and the accumulation of wealth. The quest for harmony also created the need for diversification by trade and modification of habitats, thereby developing surplus capacities and sharing.\nSharing of resources is the equivalent of consensus in creating governing structures. Just as the managers of shared resources sustain them, the leaders of communities, districts, and nations are managers of shared authority and spaces.\u0026rsquo; Sharing of the harvest is neither random nor universal, but based on patterns, kinship and correspondence. It is an honour, a duty and a privilege; those who have a little more to share may gain prestige, influence and dignity.\nManaging a space and sharing is viewed as an integral part of the ethical development of a Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq. It is important for the development of family, friendship and self. Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq see no distinction between collective or individual interests. The goal of creating a sustaining space and a sharing and caring community in which everyone can participate and belong is the ultimate interest. Everyone must come to this realization; they must come to understand the beauty and dignity of maintaining, protecting, and renewing their family space and traditions. Through this developmental process, Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq establish a clear understanding of oneself as a human and in relation to the environment. Through this process, Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq understand the needs of the biological realms and the ethical significance of their desires, freedoms and responsibilities.\nCompare and contrast the principles described by Professor Youngblood Henderson with (1) the interpretation of the 1752 Treaty in R v Syliboy and (2) the interpretation of Aboriginal title in St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling.\nJames [sákéj] Youngblood Henderson, \u0026ldquo;Mikmaw Tenure in Atlantic Canada\u0026rdquo; (1995) 18(2) Dalhousie Law Journal 196 at 241.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":130,"href":"/casebook/governance/monsanto/","title":"Monsanto Canada Inc v Schmeiser","section":"Chapter 2","content":" McLachlin C.J.C. and Fish J. — # I. Introduction # This case concerns a large scale, commercial farming operation that grew canola containing a patented cell and gene without obtaining licence or permission. The main issue is whether it thereby breached the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4. We believe that it did.\nIn reaching this conclusion, we emphasize from the outset that we are not concerned here with the innocent discovery by farmers of “blow-by” patented plants on their land or in their cultivated fields. Nor are we concerned with the scope of the respondents’ patent or the wisdom and social utility of the genetic modification of genes and cells — a practice authorized by Parliament under the Patent Act and its regulations.\nOur sole concern is with the application of established principles of patent law to the essentially undisputed facts of this case.\nII. The Salient Facts # Percy Schmeiser has farmed in Saskatchewan for more than 50 years. In 1996 he assigned his farming business to a corporation in which he and his wife are the sole shareholders and directors. He and his corporation grow wheat, peas, and a large amount of canola.\nIn the 1990s, many farmers, including five farmers in Mr. Schmeiser’s area, switched to Roundup Ready Canola, a canola variety containing genetically modified genes and cells that have been patented by Monsanto. Canola containing the patented genes and cells is resistant to a herbicide, Roundup, which kills all other plants, making it easier to control weeds. This eliminates the need for tillage and other herbicides. It also avoids seeding delays to accommodate early weed spraying. Monsanto licenses farmers to use Roundup Ready Canola, at a cost of $15 per acre.\nSchmeiser never purchased Roundup Ready Canola nor did he obtain a licence to plant it. Yet, in 1998, tests revealed that 95 to 98 percent of his 1,000 acres of canola crop was made up of Roundup Ready plants. The origin of the plants is unclear. They may have been derived from Roundup Ready seed that blew onto or near Schmeiser’s land, and was then collected from plants that survived after Schmeiser sprayed Roundup herbicide around the power poles and in the ditches along the roadway bordering four of his fields. The fact that these plants survived the spraying indicated that they contained the patented gene and cell. The trial judge found that “none of the suggested sources [proposed by Schmeiser] could reasonably explain the concentration or extent of Roundup Ready canola of a commercial quality” ultimately present in Schmeiser’s crop (Mosanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser (2001), 202 F.T.R. 78 (Fed. T.D.), at para. 118).\nThe issues on this appeal are whether Schmeiser infringed Monsanto’s patent, and if so, what remedies Monsanto may claim.\nIII. Analysis # A. The Patent: Its Scope and Validity # Canola is a valuable crop grown in Canada and used to make edible oil and animal feed. The respondents are the licensee and owner, respectively, of Canadian Patent No. 1,313,830. This patent, titled “Glyphosate-Resistant Plants” was issued on February 23, 1993, and expires on February 23, 2010. It discloses the invention of genetically engineered genes and cells containing those genes which, when inserted into plants (in this case canola), dramatically increase their tolerance to herbicides containing glyphosate. Ordinarily, glyphosate inhibits an enzyme essential for plant survival. Most plants sprayed with a glyphosate herbicide do not survive, but a canola plant grown from seed containing the modified gene will survive.\nSince 1996, canola seed containing the patented gene and cell has been produced in Canada under licence from the respondents; this seed has been marketed to farmers under the trade name “Roundup Ready Canola”, reflecting its resistance to the glyphosate herbicide “Roundup” manufactured by the respondents. Roundup can be sprayed after the canola plants have emerged, killing all plants except the canola. This eliminates the need for tillage and other herbicides. It also avoids delaying seeding to accommodate early weed spraying.\nIn 1996, approximately 600 Canadian farmers planted this Roundup Ready Canola on 50,000 acres. By 2000, approximately 20,000 farmers planted 4.5 to 5 million acres — nearly 40 percent of all canola grown in Canada.\nMonsanto requires a farmer who wishes to grow Roundup Ready Canola to enter into a licensing arrangement called a Technology Use Agreement (TUA). The licensed farmers must attend a Grower Enrollment Meeting at which Monsanto describes the technology and its licensing terms. By signing the TUA, the farmer becomes entitled to purchase Roundup Ready Canola from an authorized seed agent. They must, however, undertake to use the seed for planting a single crop and to sell that crop for consumption to a commercial purchaser authorized by Monsanto. The licensed farmers may not sell or give the seed to any third party, or save seed for replanting or inventory.\nThe TUA gives Monsanto the right to inspect the fields of the contracting farmer and to take samples to verify compliance with the TUA. The farmer must also pay a licensing fee for each acre planted with Roundup Ready Canola. In 1998, the licensing fee was $15 per acre.\nA Roundup Ready Canola plant cannot be distinguished from other canola plants except by a chemical test that detects the presence of the Monsanto gene, or by spraying the plant with Roundup. A canola plant that survives being sprayed with Roundup is Roundup Ready Canola.\nThe trial judge found the patent to be valid. He found that it did not offend the Plant Breeders’ Rights Act, S.C. 1990, c. 20, and held that the difficulty of distinguishing canola plants containing the patented gene and cell from those without it did not preclude patenting the gene. The trial judge also rejected the argument that the gene and cell are unpatentable because they can be replicated without human intervention or control.\nThe scope of the patent is largely uncontroversial.\nThe trial judge found that “it is the gene and the process for its insertion \u0026hellip; and the cell derived from that process” that comprise the invention (para. 88 (emphasis added), see also para. 26). The Federal Court of Appeal likewise endorsed the claims as being for “genes and cells which are glyphosate-resistant” (Mosanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser (2002), [2003] 2 F.C. 165 (Fed. C.A.), at para. 40).\nEveryone agrees that Monsanto did not claim protection for the genetically modified plant itself, but rather for the genes and the modified cells that make up the plant. Unlike our colleague, Arbour J., we do not believe this fact requires reading a proviso into the claims that would provide patent protection to the genes and cells only when in an isolated laboratory form.\nPurposive construction of patent claims requires that they be interpreted in light of the whole of the disclosure, including the specifications: Whirlpool Corp. v. Camco Inc., [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1067, 2000 SCC 67 (S.C.C.); Consolboard Inc. v. MacMillan Bloedel (Sask.) Ltd., [1981] 1 S.C.R. 504 (S.C.C.). In this case, the disclosure includes the following:\nAbstract of Disclosure\nPlant cells transformed using such genes and plants regenerated therefrom have been shown to exhibit a substantial degree of glyphosate resistance. (AR 235)\nBackground of the Invention\nThe object of this invention is to provide a method of genetically transforming plant cells which causes the cells and plants regenerated therefrom to become resistant to glyphosate and the herbicidal salts thereof. (AR 238)\nDetailed Description of the Invention\nSuitable plants for the practice of the present invention include, but are not limited to, soybean, cotton, alfalfa, canola, flax, tomato, sugar beet, sunflower, potato, tobacco, corn, wheat, rice and lettuce. (AR 240-241)\nA purposive construction therefore recognizes that the invention will be practised in plants regenerated from the patented cells, whether the plants are located inside or outside a laboratory. It is difficult to imagine a more likely or more evident purpose for patenting “a method of genetically transforming plant cells which causes the cells and plants regenerated therefrom to become resistant to glyphosate” (trial judgment, para. 20 (emphasis added)).\nMore particularly, the patented claims are for:\nA chimeric gene: this is a gene that does not exist in nature and is constructed from different species.\nAn expression vector: this is a DNA molecule into which another DNA segment has been integrated so as to be useful as a research tool.\nA plant transformation vector: used to permanently insert a chimeric gene into a plant’s own DNA.\nVarious species of plant cells into which the chimeric gene has been inserted.\nA method of regenerating a glyphosate-resistant plant. Once the cell is stimulated to grow into a plant, all of the differentiated cells in the plant will contain the chimeric gene, which will be passed on to offspring of the plant.\nThe appellant Schmeiser argues that the subject matter claimed in the patent is unpatentable. While acknowledging that Monsanto claims protection only over a gene and a cell, Schmeiser contends that the result of extending such protection is to restrict use of a plant and a seed. This result, the argument goes, ought to render the subject matter unpatentable, following the reasoning of the majority of this Court in Harvard College v. Canada (Commissioner of Patents), [2002] 4 S.C.R. 45, 2002 SCC 76 (S.C.C.) (”Harvard Mouse”). In that case, plants and seeds were found to be unpatentable “higher life forms”.\nThis case is different from Harvard Mouse, where the patent refused was for a mammal. The Patent Commissioner, moreover, had allowed other claims, which were not at issue before the Court in that case, notably a plasmid and a somatic cell culture. The claims at issue in this case, for a gene and a cell, are somewhat analogous, suggesting that to find a gene and a cell to be patentable is in fact consistent with both the majority and the minority holdings in Harvard Mouse.\nFurther, all members of the Court in Harvard Mouse noted in obiter that a fertilized, genetically altered oncomouse egg would be patentable subject matter, regardless of its ultimate anticipated development into a mouse (at para. 3, per Binnie J. for the minority; at para. 162, per Bastarache J. for the majority.).\nWhether or not patent protection for the gene and the cell extends to activities involving the plant is not relevant to the patent’s validity. It relates only to the factual circumstances in which infringement will be found to have taken place, as we shall explain below. Monsanto’s patent has already been issued, and the onus is thus on Schmeiser to show that the Commissioner erred in allowing the patent: Apotex Inc. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd., [2002] 4 S.C.R. 153, 2002 SCC 77 (S.C.C.), at paras. 42-44. He has failed to discharge that onus. We therefore conclude that the patent is valid.\nB. Did Schmeiser “Make” or “Construct” the Patented Gene and Cell, Thus Infringing the Patent? # The Patent Act confers on the patent owner “the exclusive right, privilege and liberty of making, constructing and using the invention and selling it to others to be used”: s. 42. Monsanto argues that when Schmeiser planted and cultivated Roundup Ready Canola seed, he necessarily infringed their patent by making the gene or cell.\nWe are not inclined to the view that Schmeiser “made” the cell within the meaning of s. 42 of the Patent Act. Neither Schmeiser nor his corporation created or constructed the gene, the expression vector, a plant transformation vector, or plant cells into which the chimeric gene has been inserted.\nIt is unnecessary, however, to express a decided opinion on this point, since we have in any event concluded that Schmeiser infringed s. 42 by “using” the patented cell and gene.\nC. Did Schmeiser “Use” the Patented Gene or Cell, Thus Infringing the Patent? # (1) The Law on “Use” # The central question on this appeal is whether Schmeiser, by collecting, saving and planting seeds containing Monsanto’s patented gene and cell, “used” that gene and cell.\nThe onus of proving infringement lies on the plaintiff, Monsanto.\nInfringement is generally a question of fact (see Whirlpool, supra). In most patent infringement cases, once the claim has been construed it is clear on the facts whether infringement has taken place: one need only compare the thing made or sold by the defendant with the claims as construed. Patent infringement cases that turn on “use” are more unusual. In those rare cases where a dispute arises on this issue, as in this case, judicial interpretation of the meaning of “use” in s. 42 of the Act may be required.\nDetermining the meaning of “use” under s. 42 is essentially a matter of statutory construction. The starting point is the plain meaning of the word, in this case “use” or “exploiter”. The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines “use” as “cause to act or serve for a purpose; bring into service; avail oneself of”: The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English (9th ed.1995), at p. 1545. This denotes utilization for a purpose. The French word “exploiter” is even clearer. It denotes utilization with a view to production or advantage: “tirer parti de (une chose), en vue d’une production ou dans un but lucratif; [\u0026hellip;] [u]tiliser d’une manière advantageuse\u0026hellip;”: Le Nouveau Petit Robert (2003), at p. 1004.\nThree well-established rules or practices of statutory interpretation assist us further. First, the inquiry into the meaning of “use” under the Patent Act must be purposive, grounded in an understanding of the reasons for which patent protection is accorded. Second, the inquiry must be contextual, giving consideration to the other words of the provision. Finally, the inquiry must be attentive to the wisdom of the case law. We will discuss each of these aids to interpretation briefly, and then apply them to the facts of this case.\nWe return first to the rule of purposive construction. Identifying whether there has been infringement by use, like construing the claim, must be approached by the route of purposive construction: Free World Trust c. Électro Santé Inc., [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1024, 2000 SCC 66 (S.C.C.). “[P]urposive construction is capable of expanding or limiting a literal [textual claim]”: Whirlpool, supra, at para. 49. Similarly, it is capable of influencing what amounts to “use” in a given case.\nThe purpose of s. 42 is to define the exclusive rights granted to the patent holder. These rights are the rights to full enjoyment of the monopoly granted by the patent. Therefore, what is prohibited is “any act that interferes with the full enjoyment of the monopoly granted to the patentee”: H. G. Fox, The Canadian Law and Practice Relating to Letters Patent for Inventions (4th ed. 1968), at p. 349; see also Lishman v. Erom Roche Inc. (1996), 68 C.P.R. (3d) 72 (Fed. T.D.), at p. 77.\nThe guiding principle is that patent law ought to provide the inventor with “protection for that which he has actually in good faith invented”: Free World Trust, supra at para. 43. Applied to “use”, the question becomes: did the defendant’s activity deprive the inventor in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, of full enjoyment of the monopoly conferred by law?\nA purposive approach is complemented by a contextual examination of s. 42 of the Patent Act, which shows that the patentee’s monopoly generally protects its business interests. Professor D. Vaver, in Intellectual Property Law: Copyright, Patents, Trade-marks (1997), suggests that the common thread among “(making, constructing and using the invention and selling it to others to be used)”\u0026hellip; is that the activity is usually for commercial purposes — to make a profit or to further the actor’s business interests \u0026hellip;” (p. 151). This is particularly consistent with the French version of s. 42, which uses the word “exploiter”.\nAs a practical matter, inventors are normally deprived of the fruits of their invention and the full enjoyment of their monopoly when another person, without licence or permission, uses the invention to further a business interest. Where the defendant’s impugned activities furthered its own commercial interests, we should therefore be particularly alert to the possibility that the defendant has committed an infringing use.\nWith respect for the contrary view of Arbour J., this does not require inventors to describe in their specifications a commercial advantage or utility for their inventions. Even in the absence of commercial exploitation, the patent holder is entitled to protection. However, a defendant’s commercial activities involving the patented object will be particularly likely to constitute an infringing use. This is so because if there is a commercial benefit to be derived from the invention, a contextual analysis of s. 42 indicates that it belongs to the patent holder. The contextual analysis of the section thus complements — and confirms — the conclusion drawn from its purposive analysis. It is the reverse side of the same coin.\nWe turn now to the case law, the third aid to interpretation. Here we derive guidance from what courts in the past have considered to be use. As we shall see, precedent confirms the approach proposed above and it is of assistance as well in resolving some of the more specific questions raised by this case.\nFirst, case law provides guidance as to whether patent protection extends to situations where the patented invention is contained within something else used by the defendant. This is relevant to the appellants’ submission that growing plants did not amount to “using” their patented genes and cells.\nPatent infringement actions often proceed in a manufacturing context. Case law has for that reason focussed on situations where a patented part or process plays a role in production. As Professor Vaver states, supra, at p. 152:\n”Use” applies both to patented products and processes, and also to their output. A patent that covers a zipper-making machine or method extends to zippers made by the machine or method. Each zipper sold without authority infringes the patent, even if the zippers themselves are unpatented. This expansive doctrine applies, however, only if the patent plays an important part in production.\nBy analogy, then, the law holds that a defendant infringes a patent when the defendant manufactures, seeks to use, or uses a patented part that is contained within something that is not patented, provided the patented part is significant or important. In the case at bar, the patented genes and cells are not merely a “part” of the plant; rather, the patented genes are present throughout the genetically modified plant and the patented cells compose its entire physical structure. In that sense, the cells are somewhat analogous to Lego blocks: if an infringing use were alleged in building a structure with patented Lego blocks, it would be no bar to a finding of infringement that only the blocks were patented and not the entire structure. If anything, the fact that the Lego structure could not exist independently of the patented blocks would strengthen the claim, underlining the significance of the patented invention to the whole product, object, or process.\nInfringement through use is thus possible even where the patented invention is part of, or composes, a broader unpatented structure or process. This is, as Professor Vaver states, an expansive rule. It is, however, firmly rooted in the principle that the main purpose of patent protection is to prevent others from depriving the inventor, even in part and even indirectly, of the monopoly that the law intends to be theirs: only the inventor is entitled, by virtue of the patent and as a matter of law, to the full enjoyment of the monopoly conferred.\n[…]\nMoreoever, as Lord Dunedin emphasized in British United Shoe Machinery Co. v. Simon Collier Ltd. (1910), 27 R.P.C. 567 (U.K. H.L.), possession as a stand-by has “insurance value”, as for example in the case of a fire extinguisher. The extinguisher is “used” to provide the means for extinguishment should the need arise. This is true, too, of a spare steam engine which is “intended in certain circumstances to be used for exactly the purpose for which the whole machine is being actually used” (p. 572). Exploitation of the stand-by utility of an invention uses it to advantage.\nIn Terrell on the Law of Patents (15th ed. 2000), at para. 8.24, the authors observe that “[t]he word ‘use’\u0026hellip; would \u0026hellip; seem to indicate making practical use of the invention itself”. In some circumstances, “practical use” may arise from the stand-by utility resulting from mere possession of the invention, or from some other practical employment with a view to advantage. Use, and thereby infringement, are then established.\n[…]\n(2) Application of the Law # The trial judge’s findings of fact are based, essentially, on the following uncontested history.\nMr. Schmeiser is a conventional, non-organic farmer. For years, he had a practice of saving and developing his own seed. The seed which is the subject of Monsanto’s complaint can be traced to a 370-acre field, called field number 1, on which Mr. Schmeiser grew canola in 1996. In 1996 five other canola growers in Mr. Schmeiser’s area planted Roundup Ready Canola.\nIn the spring of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser planted the seeds saved on field number 1. The crop grew. He sprayed a three-acre patch near the road with Roundup and found that approximately 60 percent of the plants survived. This indicates that the plants contained Monsanto’s patented gene and cell.\nIn the fall of 1997, Mr. Schmeiser harvested the Roundup Ready Canola from the three-acre patch he had sprayed with Roundup. He did not sell it. He instead kept it separate, and stored it over the winter in the back of a pick-up truck covered with a tarp.\nA Monsanto investigator took samples of canola from the public road allowances bordering on two of Mr. Schmeiser’s fields in 1997, all of which were confirmed to contain Roundup Ready Canola. In March 1998, Monsanto visited Mr. Schmeiser and put him on notice of its belief that he had grown Roundup Ready Canola without a licence. Mr. Schmeiser nevertheless took the harvest he had saved in the pick-up truck to a seed treatment plant and had it treated for use as seed. Once treated, it could be put to no other use. Mr. Schmeiser planted the treated seed in nine fields, covering approximately 1,000 acres in all.\nNumerous samples were taken, some under court order and some not, from the canola plants grown from this seed. Moreover, the seed treatment plant, unbeknownst to Mr. Schmeiser, kept some of the seed he had brought there for treatment in the spring of 1998, and turned it over to Monsanto. A series of independent tests by different experts confirmed that the canola Mr. Schmeiser planted and grew in 1998 was 95 to 98 percent Roundup resistant. Only a grow-out test by Mr. Schmeiser in his yard in 1999 and by Mr. Freisen on samples supplied by Mr. Schmeiser did not support this result.\nDr. Downey testified that the high rate of post-Roundup spraying survival in the 1997 samples was “consistent only with the presence in field number 2 of canola grown from commercial Roundup tolerant seed” (trial judgment, at para. 112). According to Dr. Dixon, responsible for the testing by Monsanto US at St. Louis, the “defendants’ samples contain[ed] the DNA sequences claimed in claims 1, 2, 5, and 6 of the patent and the plant cell claimed in claims 22, 23, 27, 28 and 45 of the patent”(trial judgment, at para. 113). As the trial judge noted, this opinion was uncontested.\nThe remaining question was how such a pure concentration of Roundup Ready Canola came to grow on the appellants’ land in 1998. The trial judge rejected the suggestion that it was the product of seed blown or inadvertently carried onto the appellants’ land (at para. 118):\nIt may be that some Roundup Ready seed was carried to Mr. Schmeiser’s field without his knowledge. Some such seed might have survived the winter to germinate in the spring of 1998. However, I am persuaded by evidence of Dr. Keith Downey \u0026hellip; that none of the suggested sources could reasonably explain the concentration or extent of Roundup Ready canola of a commercial quality evident from the results of tests on Schmeiser’s crop.\nHe concluded, at para. 120:\nI find that in 1998 Mr. Schmeiser planted canola seed saved from his 1997 crop in his field number 2 which he knew or ought to have known was Roundup tolerant, and that seed was the primary source for seeding and for the defendants’ crops in all nine fields of canola in 1998.\nIn summary, it is clear on the findings of the trial judge that the appellants saved, planted, harvested and sold the crop from plants containing the gene and plant cell patented by Monsanto. The issue is whether this conduct amounted to “use” of Monsanto’s invention — the glyphosate-resistant gene and cell.\nThe preliminary question is whether this conduct falls within the meaning of “use” or “exploiter”. We earlier concluded that these words, taken together, connote utilization with a view to production or advantage. Saving and planting seed, then harvesting and selling the resultant plants containing the patented cells and genes appears, on a common sense view, to constitute “utilization” of the patented material for production and advantage, within the meaning of s. 42.\nWe turn next to whether the other considerations relevant to “use” support this preliminary conclusion.\nIn this regard, the first and fundamental question is whether Monsanto was deprived in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, of the full enjoyment of the monopoly that the patent confers. And the answer is “yes”.\nMonsanto’s patent gives it a monopoly over the patented gene and cell. The patent’s object is production of a plant which is resistant to Roundup herbicide. Monsanto’s monopoly enabled it to charge a licensing fee of $15 per acre to farmers wishing to grow canola plants with the patented genes and cells. The appellants cultivated 1030 acres of plants with these patented properties without paying Monsanto for the right to do so. By cultivating a plant containing the patented gene and composed of the patented cells without licence, the appellants thus deprived Monsanto of the full enjoyment of its monopoly.\nThe complementary question is whether the appellants employed or possessed the patented invention in the context of their commercial or business interests. The initial answer must again be “yes”.\nOne of the appellants’ businesses was growing canola. It used seeds containing the patented qualities in that business. Subject to the appellants’ argument discussed below that they did not use the patented invention itself (whether because they used only the plant or because they did not spray with Roundup), the appellants’ involvement with the disputed canola is clearly commercial in nature.\nThe answers to the two questions of principle that lie at the heart of “use” under the Patent Act both thus suggest that the trial judge and the Court of Appeal were correct in finding that the appellants “used” the protected invention and hence infringed Monsanto’s patent. It is helpful as well, however, to consider the insights gained from the case law discussed above and their impact on arguments raised against this conclusion.\nFirst, it is suggested that because Monsanto’s claims are for genes and cells rather than for plants, it follows that infringement by use will only occur where a defendant uses the genes or cells in their isolated, laboratory form. This argument appears not to have been advanced in any detail at trial or on appeal, but is the position taken by our colleague, Arbour J.\nIt is uncontested that Monsanto’s patented claim is only for the gene and cell that it developed. This, however, is the beginning and not the end of the inquiry. The more difficult question — and the nub of this case — is whether, by cultivating plants containing the cell and gene, the appellants used the patented components of those plants. The position taken by Arbour J. assumes that this inquiry is redundant and that the only way a patent may be infringed is to use the patented invention in isolation.\nThis position flies in the face of century-old patent law, which holds that where a defendant’s commercial or business activity involves a thing of which a patented part is a significant or important component, infringement is established. It is no defence to say that the thing actually used was not patented, but only one of its components.\nProfessor Vaver, supra, observes that this is an “expansive doctrine”. This is so because otherwise the inventor would be deprived of the full enjoyment of the monopoly that the law of patent confers on him or her. It is rare that patented components or processes are used in isolation; without this principle, an infringer could use the invention to his advantage, and take shelter in the excuse that he or she was not using the invention in isolation.\nProvided the patented invention is a significant aspect of the defendant’s activity, the defendant will be held to have “used” the invention and violated the patent. If Mr. Schmeiser’s activities with Roundup Ready Canola plants amounted to use interfering with Monsanto’s full enjoyment of their monopoly on the gene and cell, those activities infringed the patent. Infringement does not require use of the gene or cell in isolation.\nSecond, Mr. Schmeiser argued at trial that he should not be held to have “used” Monsanto’s invention because he never took commercial advantage of the special utility that invention offered — resistance to Roundup herbicide. He testified that he never used Roundup herbicide as an aid to cultivation. (That he used it in 1996 in his initial gathering of the Roundup Ready seed is clear.)\nThe trial judge dismissed this argument. He pointed out, at para. 122, that it “is the taking of the essence of the invention \u0026hellip; that constitutes infringement”, and that by growing and selling the Roundup Ready crop Mr. Schmeiser took that invention. Consequently, in the judge’s view, “whether or not that crop was sprayed with Roundup \u0026hellip; [was] not important” (para. 123).\nPerhaps the appellants’ failure to spray with Roundup herbicide is a way of attempting to rebut the presumption of use that flows from possession. However, the appellants have failed to rebut the presumption.\nTheir argument fails to account for the stand-by or insurance utility of the properties of the patented genes and cells. Whether or not a farmer sprays with Roundup herbicide, cultivating canola containing the patented genes and cells provides stand-by utility. The farmer benefits from that advantage from the outset: if there is reason to spray in the future, the farmer may proceed to do so.\nAlthough not directly at issue in this case, cultivating Roundup Ready Canola also presents future revenue opportunities to “brown-bag” the product to other farmers unwilling to pay the licence fee, thus depriving Monsanto of the full enjoyment of their monopoly.\nFurther, the appellants did not provide sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of use. It may well be that defendant farmers could rebut the presumption by showing that they never intended to cultivate plants containing the patented genes and cells. They might perhaps prove that the continued presence of the patented gene on their land was accidental and unwelcome, for example, by showing that they acted quickly to arrange for its removal, and that its concentration was consistent with that to be expected from unsolicited “blow-by” canola. Knowledge of infringement is never a necessary component of infringement. However, a defendant’s conduct on becoming aware of the presence of the patented invention may assist in rebutting the presumption of use arising from possession.\nHowever, the appellants in this case actively cultivated canola containing the patented invention as part of their business operations. Mr. Schmeiser complained that the original plants came onto his land without his intervention. However, he did not at all explain why he sprayed Roundup to isolate the Roundup Ready plants he found on his land; why he then harvested the plants and segregated the seeds, saved them, and kept them for seed; why he next planted them; and why, through this husbandry, he ended up with 1030 acres of Roundup Ready Canola which would otherwise have cost him $15,000. In these circumstances, the presumption of use flowing from possession stands unrebutted.\nThird, as in their submissions on validity, the appellants seek to rely on the decision of the majority of this Court in Harvard Mouse. They contend that the patent should be given a narrow scope for infringement purposes, since the plants reproduce through the laws of nature rather than through human intervention. Thus, they argue, propagation of Roundup Ready Canola without a licence cannot be a “use” by them because plants are living things that grow by themselves.\nThis is also the perspective adopted by Arbour J. In support of the proposition that infringement of gene claims occurs only in a laboratory setting, she cites Kirin Amgen Inc. v. Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd., [2002] E.W.J. No. 3792 (Eng. C.A.). That case dealt with a protein useful in the diagnosis and treatment of blood disorders. The English court construed the claims to exclude the naturally occurring form of the DNA sequence in a human cell. However, this was done to accord with the provisions of a regulatory scheme that has no parallel in Canada: Article 5 of the European Parliament’s Directive 98/44/EC, which regulates patentability of biotechnological inventions. It states that the discovery of elements of the human body, including genes, is not patentable, although such elements are patentable when isolated or otherwise produced through technical means. The legislature has not enacted a comparable statutory scheme in Canada to narrow the scope of patent construction. Thus, Kirin Amgen is not applicable to the case before this Court.\nThe appellants’ argument also ignores the role human beings play in agricultural propagation. Farming is a commercial enterprise in which farmers sow and cultivate the plants which prove most efficient and profitable. Plant science has been with us since long before Mendel. Human beings since time immemorial have striven to produce more efficient plants. Huge investments of energy and money have been poured into the quest for better seeds and better plants. One way in which that investment is protected is through the Patent Act giving investors a monopoly when they create a novel and useful invention in the realm of plant science, such as genetically modified genes and cells.\nFinally, many inventions make use of natural processes in order to work. For example, many valid patents have referred to various yeasts, which would have no practical utility at all without “natural forces”. See Abitibi Co., Re (1982), 62 C.P.R. (2d) 81 (Can. Pat. App. Bd. \u0026amp; Pat. Commr.), in which the inventive step consisted of acclimatizing a known species of yeast from domestic sewage to a new environment, where it would then through its natural operation act to purify waste from pulp plants.\nThe issue is not the perhaps adventitious arrival of Roundup Ready on Mr. Schmeiser’s land in 1998. What is at stake in this case is sowing and cultivation, which necessarily involves deliberate and careful activity on the part of the farmer. The appellants suggest that when a farmer such as Mr. Schmeiser actively cultivates a crop with particular properties through activities such as testing, isolating, treating, and planting the desired seed and tending the crops until harvest, the result is a crop which has merely “grown itself”. Such a suggestion denies the realities of modern agriculture.\nInventions in the field of agriculture may give rise to concerns not raised in other fields — moral concerns about whether it is right to manipulate genes in order to obtain better weed control or higher yields. It is open to Parliament to consider these concerns and amend the Patent Act should it find them persuasive.\nOur task, however, is to interpret and apply the Patent Act as it stands, in accordance with settled principles. Under the present Act, an invention in the domain of agriculture is as deserving of protection as an invention in the domain of mechanical science. Where Parliament has not seen fit to distinguish between inventions concerning plants and other inventions, neither should the courts.\nInvoking the concepts of implied licence and waiver, the appellants argue that this Court should grant an exemption from infringement to “innocent bystanders”. The simple answer to this contention is that on the facts found by the trial judge, Mr. Schmeiser was not an innocent bystander; rather, he actively cultivated Roundup Ready Canola. Had he been a mere “innocent bystander”, he could have refuted the presumption of use arising from his possession of the patented gene and cell. More broadly, to the extent this submission rests on policy arguments about the particular dangers of biotechnology inventions, these, as discussed, find no support in the Patent Act as it stands today. Again, if Parliament wishes to respond legislatively to biotechnology inventions concerning plants, it is free to do so. Thus far it has not chosen to do so.\nThe appellants argue, finally, that Monsanto’s activities tread on the ancient common law property rights of farmers to keep that which comes onto their land. Just as a farmer owns the progeny of a “stray bull” which wanders onto his land, so Mr. Schmeiser argues he owns the progeny of the Roundup Ready Canola that came onto his field. However, the issue is not property rights, but patent protection. Ownership is no defence to a breach of the Patent Act.\nWe conclude that the trial judge and Court of Appeal were correct in concluding that the appellants “used” Monsanto’s patented gene and cell and hence infringed the Patent Act.\n[…]\nIV. Conclusion # We would allow the appeal in part, setting aside the award for account of profit. In all other respects we would confirm the order of the trial judge. In view of this mixed result, we would order that each party bear its own costs throughout.\n"},{"id":131,"href":"/problems/dutcher-multi-juridicalism/","title":"Multi-juridical Canada and Jeremy Dutcher's Musical Dialogues","section":"Problems","content":"We have seen this week and last how judges in the style of classical common law thought largely foreclosed any genuine consideration of Indigenous laws or of a multi-juridical Canada.

The first suppliant is a British subject by naturalization, the second a British subject by birth, and the suppliants in the third petition are Japanese nationals. The questions of law were heard together, the circumstances being such that the answer in any one case will be equally applicable in the others.\nIt will be desirable to set out the sequence of events before dealing with the contentions made on the suppliants\u0026rsquo; behalf. By Order in Council P.C. 365, dated January 16, 1942, the Defence of Canada Regulations (Consolidation) 1941 were amended by substituting a new Regulation 4 for the one previously in force by which the Minister of National Defence with the concurrence of the Minister of Justice was empowered, \u0026ldquo;if it appears necessary or expedient so to do in the public interest and for the efficient prosecution of the war\u0026rdquo;, to make an order declaring a protected area and to make certain orders with respect to such area including that of requiring \u0026ldquo;all or any enemy aliens to leave such protected area.\u0026rdquo; By an Order, dated January 29, 1942, made pursuant to this authority, the portion of British Columbia lying west of the Cascade Mountains (more particularly described in the Order) was declared to be a protected area. By Order in Council P.C. 1486, dated February 24, 1942, the power of requiring persons to leave a protected area was extended to include persons who were not alien enemies and the Minister of Justice was given power \u0026ldquo;to require any or all persons to leave such protected area\u0026rdquo;. And on February 26, 1942, the Minister made what may be called the Japanese evacuation order which provided, inter alia, that \u0026ldquo;every person of the Japanese race shall leave the protected area aforesaid forthwith.\u0026rdquo; This applied to persons of Japanese origin regardless of whether they were Japanese nationals or British subjects either by birth or naturalization. The suppliants were all residing within the protected area and subject to the evacuation order. The next relevant order was Order in Council P.C. 1665, dated March 4, 1942, by which the British Columbia Security Commission was established and charged with the duty of planning, supervising and directing the evacuation. We are concerned only with section 12 of this Order under the heading \u0026ldquo;Custody of Japanese Property\u0026rdquo;, which provides as follows:\nCustody of Japanese Property\n12. (1) As a protective measure only, all property situated in any protected area of British Columbia belonging to any person of the Japanese race resident in such area (excepting fishing vessels subject to Order in Council P.C. 288 of the 13th January, 1942, and deposits of money, shares of stock, debentures, bonds or other securities), delivered up to any person by the owner pursuant to the Order of the Minister of Justice dated February 26, 1942, or which is turned over to the Custodian by the owner, or which the owner, on being evacuated is unable to take with him, shall be vested in and subject to the control and management of the Custodian as defined in the Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1939; provided, however, that no commission shall be charged by the Custodian in respect of such control and management.\n(2) Subject as hereinafter provided, and for the purposes of the control and management of such property, rights and interest by the Custodian, the Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1939, shall apply mutatis mutandis to the same extent as if such property, rights and interests belonged to any enemy within the meaning of the said Regulations.\n(3) The property, rights and interests so vested in and subject to the control and management of the Custodian, or the proceeds thereof, shall be dealt with in such manner as the Governor in Council may direct.\nThen by Order in Council P.C. 2483, dated March 27, this provision was rescinded and the following substituted:\n12. (1) Subject as hereinafter in this Regulation provided, as a protective measure only, all property situated in any protected area of British Columbia belonging to any person of the Japanese race (excepting fishing vessels subject to Order in Council P.C. 288 of January 13, 1942, and deposits of money, shares of stock, debentures, bonds or other securities) delivered up to any person by the owner pursuant to an order of the Minister of Justice, or which is turned over to the Custodian by or on behalf of the owner, or which the owner, on being evacuated from the protected area, is unable to take with him, shall be vested in and subject to the control and management of the Custodian as defined in the Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy (1939); provided, however, that no commission shall be charged by the Custodian in respect of such control and management.\n(2) The Custodian may, notwithstanding anything contained in this Regulation, order that all or any property whatsoever, situated in any protected area of British Columbia, belonging to any person of the Japanese race shall, for the purpose of protecting the interests of the owner or any other person, be vested in the Custodian, and the Custodian shall have full power to administer such property for the benefit of all such interested persons, and shall release such property upon being satisfied that the interests aforesaid will not be prejudiced thereby.\n(3) For the purposes of the control and management of such property by the Custodian, the Consolidated Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy (1939), shall apply mutatis mutandis to the same extent as if the property belonged to an enemy within the meaning of the said Consolidated Regulations.\nIn this state of the law the suppliants left the protected area. But before they did so they had in each case signed a document, Form \u0026ldquo;JP\u0026rdquo;, giving particulars of their property in the protected area, in which the following statement was made:\nI, the undersigned, hereby voluntarily turn over to the Custodian all my property in the protected area as set out above, except fishing vessels, deposits of money, shares of stock, debentures, bonds or other securities, if any.\nThen, after the suppliants had left, by Order in Council P.C. 469, dated January 19, 1943, it was provided inter alia:\nWherever, under Orders in Council under the War Measures Act, chapter 206 of the Revised Statutes of Canada 1927, the Custodian has been vested with the power and responsibility of controlling and managing any property of persons of the Japanese race evacuated from the protected areas, such power and responsibility shall be deemed to include and to have included from the date of the vesting of such property in the Custodian, the power to liquidate, sell, or otherwise dispose of such property; and for the purpose of such liquidation, sale or other disposition the Consolidated Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy (1939) shall apply mutatis mutandis as if the property belonged to an enemy within the meaning of the said Consolidated Regulations.\nThe next fact of importance is that on June 19, 1943, the Custodian advertised certain properties for sale by tender, including those of the suppliants. It was this advertisement that led to the launching of the petitions of right.\nThe suppliants object to the sale, liquidation or other disposition of their properties and deny the right of the Custodian to take any such action against their wishes and desires. The petitions set forth a number of contentions and each concludes with a prayer for certain declarations. The contentions are that the suppliants are entitled to rely upon the terms of Orders in Council P.C. 1665 and P.C. 2483 providing that their properties should be and remain in the possession of the Custodian and under his management and control for the protection of the suppliants for the period of their enforced evacuation; that, in the alternative, the Custodian acquired possession of the properties upon trust requiring him to hold them in trust for the protection of the suppliants and under his management and control upon a condition requiring him to return them to the suppliants when the area ceases to be a protected area; that, in the further alternative, the properties are under the control and management of the Custodian upon trust on a condition requiring him to return them to the suppliants after the end of the war or to retain and hold them for their protection and benefit until otherwise authorized or directed in accordance with any Treaty of Peace between Canada and Japan; that in the further alternative, the Orders in Council P.C. 1665, P.C. 2483 and P.C. 469 are invalid and unconstitutional and ultra vires, or that if the first is valid and constitutional the others are not. The suppliants seek a number of declarations, namely, that the Custodian is not entitled to sell, liquidate or otherwise dispose of the properties against their wishes; that the Orders in Council referred to, or one or more of them are or is invalid, unconstitutional and ultra vires or, in the alternative, do not authorize or empower the Custodian to sell, liquidate or otherwise dispose of the properties without their consent; and that the Custodian is a trustee of the properties for them as set out in the petitions. Then there is a request for a mandamus compelling the Custodian to carry out the terms of his trust and an injunction to restrain him from selling, liquidating or otherwise disposing of the properties. Essentially, the purpose of the petitions is to prevent the Custodian from selling the properties: the essence of the claim is that he has no valid power to do so.\nThe proceedings are by way of petition of right against the Crown as though the properties were in the possession of the Crown and on the assumption that, although they are vested in the Custodian, he holds them as the servant or agent of the Crown.\nThe first objection taken is that any relief sought is in respect of the Custodian; that the Custodian is not a servant or agent of the Crown but an independent person in respect of whose acts a petition of right against the Crown does not lie, and that no cause of action against the Crown is shown.\nThe cases lay down a number of tests to be applied in determining whether a body is a servant or agent of the Crown or is independent of it. In Fox v. Government of Newfoundland it was held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that certain balances in the books of a bank to the credit of the various boards of education in Newfoundland were not debts or claims due to the Crown or to the Government or revenues of Newfoundland. At page 672, Sir Richard Couch said:\nThe appointment of boards for each of the three religious denominations, and the constitution of the board, indicate that it is not to be a mere agent of the Government for the distribution of the money, but is to have within the limit of general educational purposes a discretionary power in expending it \u0026mdash; a power which is independent of the Government.\nThe determining test in this case was the possession of a discretionary power independent of the Government. The above statement was approved by the Judicial Committee in the leading case of Metropolitan Meat Industry Board v. Sheedy . In that case the Meat Industry Act, 1915, of New South Wales provided for the maintenance and control of slaughter houses, cattle sale yards, and meat markets in Sydney and the adjoining district, and established the Board to administer the Act. The members of the Board were to be appointed by the Governor, who had power to veto certain of its actions. The Board had wide powers, which it exercised at its discretion; any power of interference which a Minister of the Crown possessed was not such as to make the acts of administration his acts. Money received by the Board for tolls and fees to be levied by it was not paid into the general funds of the State, but to its own fund, out of which the expenses of carrying the Act into effect were to be met. The question for determination was whether an amount due to the Board by a company which had gone into liquidation was a debt due to the Crown and as such entitled to priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors. It was held that the Board was not acting as a servant of the Crown and the amount owing to it was not a debt due to the Crown. At page 905, Viscount Haldane said:\nThey are a body with discretionary powers of their own. Even if a Minister of the Crown has power to interfere with them, there is nothing in the statute which makes the acts of administration his as distinguished from theirs. That they were incorporated does not matter. It is also true that the Governor appoints their members and can veto certain of their actions. But these provisions, even when taken together, do not outweigh the fact that the Act of 1915 confers on the appellant Board wide powers which are given to it to be exercised at its own discretion and without consulting the direct representatives of the Crown. Such are the powers of acquiring land, constructing abattoirs and works, selling cattle and meat, either on its own behalf or on behalf of other persons, and leasing its property. Nor does the Board pay its receipts into the general revenue of the State, and the charges it levies go into its own fund.\nUndoubtedly, the governing factor in deciding that the Board was not a servant of the Crown but an independent body was that, although it was subject to governmental control in several respects, it had wide powers which were to be exercised at its own discretion and without consulting any direct representative of the Crown. Another indication of its independence was that it had control over its own revenues and their expenditure. An important Canadian case on the subject is the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in City of Halifax v. Halifax Harbour Commissioners . There the question was whether the Halifax Harbour Commissioners who occupied the Crown property of Halifax Harbour were assessable for business tax as an \u0026ldquo;occupier\u0026rdquo; within Section 357(1) of the Halifax City Charter (1931). Duff C.J., speaking for the Court, carefully scrutinized the nature of the powers and duties of the Commissioners, and summarized the controls and supervision to which they were subject. He pointed out that in the exercise of all their powers the Commissioners were subject to the control of the Crown and concluded that they were performing Government services and were occupying the property in question in and for the services of the Crown and were, therefore, not assessable for business tax. The Commissioners had none of the free discretionary powers that are necessary to independence, as laid down in Metropolitan Meat Industry Board v. Sheedy (supra), and the case was, therefore, readily distinguishable from it. In coming to its decision the Court applied a number of tests in addition to those already referred to. For example, it inquired into such questions as the ownership of the occupied property, namely, whether it belonged to the Crown or the occupant, and the nature of the functions of the occupant, that is, whether they were those ordinarily performed in the course of government. Then reference may also be made to the recent judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Montreal v. Montreal Locomotive Works , in which Lord Wright stresses the difficulty which is inherent in deciding whether a person is a servant or not, and points out that the presence or absence of control by itself is not always conclusive and suggests other tests as well, which are not applicable in the present case. Vide also the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Regina Industries Ltd. v. Regina .\nThis leads to an examination of the position of the Custodian under the Consolidated Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy (1939), as enacted by Order in Council P.C. 3959, dated August 21, 1940, as amended by Order in Council P.C. 5353, dated October 3, 1940, hereinafter called the Consolidated Regulations. By Section 6 the Secretary of State is appointed as the Custodian to receive, hold, preserve and deal with such property, as may be paid to or vested in him under the regulations. In my opinion, nothing turns on the fact that a Minister of the Crown is appointed as Custodian, for anyone else might just as validly have been appointed. By section 21 all enemy property in Canada vests in the Custodian and is subject to his control. The Consolidated Regulations give him very wide discretionary powers over such property; for example, by section 21(2) he may deal with the interest of the enemy in it as he may in his sole discretion decide; under section 23 he may have it transferred into his own name; by section 38 he may, where he considers it advisable to do so, liquidate it; or by section 39, at his discretion, relinquish it; or by section 40 dispose of it either publicly or privately, as he in his discretion shall think proper; the property held by him is by section 49 rendered free from attachment or execution and by section 50 he is made not liable for any charge against it. These references are sufficient to show the great width of the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s discretionary powers and his freedom from governmental control in dealing with the property vested in him. In the matter of litigation, by section 27 provision is made for proceedings by and against the Custodian under certain conditions and under section 36 he may take action to recover money payable to him under the regulations. It is to be noted that the right of action is that of the Custodian, not that of the Crown; indeed, he may himself have to take proceedings as Custodian against the Crown as has happened in this Court. Then under the regulations the Custodian is given very wide administrative powers involving the free exercise of discretion. By section 43(1) he shall establish an office or offices for the administration of the regulations and is empowered to select officers, clerks and advisers and to pay them such remuneration as he may determine. This is a most unusual power and indicative of the independent character of the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s office. This is not in the least diminished by the special provision for a special purpose in section 43(2) that the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s office shall be deemed to be a Department of Government of Canada and the Custodian the head of such Department, for the purposes of the Canada Evidence Act. Furthermore, the Custodian is given full control over his own funds. By section 42 he may deposit moneys paid to or received by him in any bank. They are not paid in to the Consolidated Revenue. By section 44(1) he is empowered to make certain charges against released property and by section 44(2) he may retain out of the proceeds of all property vested in him sufficient moneys to pay the expenses incurred in the administration of the regulations. He is not dependent at all for the administration of the regulations on any appropriations by Parliament. These references to the regulations sufficiently show the independence with which the law has endowed the Custodian. It is true that he is subject to control by the Governor in Council, but such control is not executive but of a legislative nature of the same kind as that which Parliament itself might exercise, which is a very different thing from the control which the Crown, meaning thereby His Majesty acting on advice in his executive capacity, exercises over its servants. If the Custodian is not the servant or agent of the Crown, it must follow that a petition of right cannot lie against it in respect of his acts and it was so held by this Court in Ritcher v. The King . There Angers J. expressed the opinion that the Custodian did not hold enemy property as an agent or servant of the Crown and that no petition of right could lie against the Crown in respect of any claim asserted in respect of his actions. I am of a similar opinion in the present case. It seems clear to me, in view of the wide discretionary powers of the Custodian over the property vested in him, his freedom from governmental control in the management of his office and the appointment and remuneration of members of his staff, and his complete control over his funds and their expenditure, that it was intended by the Consolidated Regulations that the Custodian should not be a servant or agent of the Crown but an independent person. It was important and proper that this should be so in order that the properties vested in him should be held by him neither for the former owners nor for the Crown but independently in a state of suspense until their final disposition should be determined pursuant to appropriate legislative enactment in the light of the turn of events on the conclusion of the emergency that made their vesting necessary or advisable. That being so, it follows that the course taken by the suppliants in lodging petitions of right against the Crown in respect of an intended sale of the suppliants\u0026rsquo; properties by the Custodian was erroneous, and that since no cause of action against the Crown is shown the answer to the question of law herein must be in the negative. If the suppliants have any cause of action it could only be against the Custodian; as to which, the Court expresses no opinion in the absence of the Custodian, who is not a party to these proceedings.\nCounsel for the suppliants sought to save himself from this conclusion by arguing that the Custodian was not in the same position with regard to Japanese evacuee property as with regard to alien enemy property. His contention was that the suppliants were not alien enemies within the meaning of the Consolidated Regulations, which is true, and that they do not apply in the present case except only for limited purposes, since under Order in Council P.C. 1665 of March 4, 1942, and Order in Council P.C. 2483 of March 27, 1942, Japanese evacuee property is vested in the Custodian \u0026ldquo;as a protective measure only\u0026rdquo; and made subject only \u0026ldquo;to the control and management of the Custodian\u0026rdquo; and that at the time of the vesting the Custodian had no right of sale. In my opinion, even if this were conceded, it would not alter the character of the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s powers and duties. His discretionary powers might be more limited in scope than in the case of alien enemy property, but the difference would be one of degree rather than of kind. He would still have very wide free discretionary powers in the field of control and management. And, if Order in Council P.C. 469 of January 19, 1943, is valid, there would be no difference at all in the scope of the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s discretionary powers as between alien enemy property on the one hand and Japanese evacuee property on the other.\nCounsel for the suppliants also took the position that, even if the Custodian were not a servant or agent of the Crown, the filing of a petition of right would, nevertheless, be the correct procedure for the relief sought on the ground that although the properties were vested in the Custodian, he derived his title to them from the Crown, and he relied upon a number of cases in support of his view including Attorney General for Ontario v. McLean Gold Mines . There two mining claims in Ontario granted by the Crown were forfeited, under the Mining Tax Act, for default in the payment of taxes, and were granted to another person. Assignees of the original grantee brought an action against the Attorney General, the Minister of Mines, and registered owners under the new grant, alleging defects in the forfeiture proceedings, and claiming a declaration that they were the true owners, a declaration that the forfeiture certificates were void and an order that they should be substituted as owners in the register of titles. It was held that as the plaintiffs\u0026rsquo; claim impugned the title accruing to the Crown on the forfeiture it could not be made by action, but only by petition of right. In my opinion, this judgment has no applicability in the present case, since the title to the suppliants\u0026rsquo; property was never in the Crown and the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s title could not, therefore, have been derived from it. To contend that because the suppliants\u0026rsquo; properties were vested in the Custodian by an Order in Council, passed under the War Measures Act, he derived his title to them from the Crown shows a misconception of the nature of the source of the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s title. It did not come from the Crown pursuant to an executive act of the Crown. Both the divesting from the former Japanese owners and the vesting in the Custodian were pursuant to an Order in Council passed by the Governor in Council as a legislative enactment under the legislative power devolved upon him by Parliament and having the same force as if it had been enacted by Parliament itself. The source of the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s title is legislative, not executive. It was not a case at all of the title having first been in the Crown and then transferred to the Custodian. It was never in the Crown, and the Custodian did not derive any title from it.\n1Under the circumstances, since the Custodian is not the servant or agent of the Crown and no cause of action against the Crown appears I must hold that the proceedings by way of petition of right were erroneously taken. In my opinion, this ends the matter and is a sufficient reason for answering the question of law in the negative.\nI was urged, however, by counsel for the suppliants to deal with his attack on the validity of the Orders in Council on the ground that it could be made only by way of petition of right. I do not agree with this or with the other grounds advanced for dealing with the question. But since it is of great importance and has some bearing, as already suggested, on whether there is any difference in kind between the powers of the Custodian in the present case and those which he possesses as Custodian of alien enemy property, I shall deal with the question, although with considerable doubt as to whether it can properly be raised in these proceedings.\nCounsel for the suppliants confined his attack on the validity of the Orders in Council to the extent to which they purport to authorize the Custodian to liquidate, sell or otherwise dispose of the properties of Japanese evacuees vested in him. The argument ran as follows. It was conceded that the order for the evacuation of persons of Japanese origin from the protected area was valid as a war measure, whether such persons were Japanese nationals or British subjects. It was also conceded that Orders in Council P.C. 1665 and P.C. 2483 were valid in so far as they vested the properties in the Custodian for his control and management; since the Japanese on their evacuation had to leave their properties, it was said to be the duty and responsibility of the Government to look after them, so that the vesting of them in the Custodian for control and management for the protection of the former owners was necessarily incidental and ancillary to the evacuation and, as such, a valid war measure. But this was the limit of counsel\u0026rsquo;s concessions. While the terms of Order in Council P.C. 469, cited above, were the main object of counsel\u0026rsquo;s attack he made it clear that if they were to be regarded as merely declaratory and the power of control and management conferred by Orders in Council P.C. 1665 and P.C. 2483 construed as including the power of sale, then his attack extended also to these Orders in Council to the extent that they purported to confer such power. It was the authorization of the power of liquidation, sale or other disposition of the properties that was objected to as being beyond the powers of the Governor in Council even under the War Measures Act. It was admitted that the power of control and management might conceivably include the right to sell the properties if such sale was necessary to protect them or the former owners, but not otherwise, and there could be no such necessity in the present case where, as alleged in the petitions, the properties are rented and the rentals are sufficient to maintain them in good standing and condition. Counsel urged that there was a vital difference between the right to authorize control and management and the right to authorize sale; the former was intra vires, the latter was not. The validity of the Orders in Council vesting the properties of the evacuated Japanese in the Custodian for his control and management could be justified, so counsel argued, only on the basis that such vesting was for the protection of the former Japanese owners and was ancillary to their evacuation, but that no such justification was possible for an Order in Council authorizing the sale of properties already in the custody of the Custodian and subject to his control and management. The argument went on that only that which was ancillary to the evacuation was intra vires and that, while control and management of the properties was ancillary, sale of them was not. Counsel urged vigorously that Orders in Council under the War Measures Act must be for war objects; that the authorizing of the sale of the properties had nothing to do with the evacuation, or the attainment of the objects of the war or national security, was not a war measure at all and, therefore, not within the competence of the Governor in Council; that the Court had the right to question the validity of Orders in Council under the War Measures Act; and that it ought to intervene in an obvious case such as this and declare that the Order in Council authorizing the liquidation, sale or other disposition of the properties in question was not a war measure at all, but an unwarranted invasion of property and civil rights and, consequently, ultra vires.\nWith the propriety of the action of the Custodian in advertising the suppliants\u0026rsquo; properties for sale the Court can have no concern in these proceedings. The sole question is whether he had the right to do so and that in turn depends on whether the Order in Council authorizing the power of sale is within the competence of the Governor in Council. Order in Council P.C. 469 of January 19, 1943, was expressly declared to be made under the authority of the War Measures Act, R.S.C. 1927, chap. 206, and contained a number of recitals including the following:\nThat the evacuation of persons of the Japanese race from the protected areas has now been substantially completed and it is necessary to provide facilities for liquidation of property in appropriate cases.\nAlthough the Order in Council was passed under the authority of the War Measures Act and the Governor in Council has declared that it is a necessary measure, the Court is invited by counsel for the suppliants to declare that it is not a war measure and is, therefore, not validly enacted. Whether the Court can assert an opinion contrary to that declared by the Governor in Council is the matter to be determined. The question has, I think, been completely answered by the authorities.\nThe War Measures Act, first enacted in 1914, Statutes of Canada, 1914, 2nd Session, chap. 2, was not repealed after the end of the first world war, and was carried into the 1927 Revision with only minor changes made by the Commissioners and some re-arrangement of its sections. The first portion of section 3, previously section 6, provides as follows:\n3. The Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada;\nThe validity of the War Measures Act itself depends on whether it falls within the jurisdiction of the Canadian Parliament under the opening words of section 91 of the British North America Act, which empowers it to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada. It was considered intra vires by the Supreme Court of Canada in Re George Edwin Gray , and its validity was settled by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Fort Frances Pulp and Power Co. v. Manitoba Free Press . It was not challenged in the present case.\nUnder the circumstances, the question whether Order in Council 469 is intra vires the Governor in Council is really a question of construction of the War Measures Act and an ascertainment of whether its requirements have been complied with. If the answer to this question is in the affirmative, then it is clear that the Court has no right to question the decision of the Governor in Council as to the necessity or advisability of the measure. That was the conclusion of the Supreme Court of Canada in Reference re Chemicals Regulations and Administrative Orders in which, although the primary question was as to the power of the Governor in Council to delegate authority to subordinate agencies, the nature and extent of the powers of the Governor in Council under the War Measures Act were also dealt with. The Court made it clear that the authority vested in the Governor in Council is legislative in character and of the same nature and subject to the same limitation as that possessed by Parliament itself. Duff C.J., at page 9, said:\nThe decision involved the principle, which must be taken in this Court to be settled, that an order in council in conformity with the conditions prescribed by, and the provisions of, the War Measures Act may have the effect of an Act of Parliament.\nAnd Rinfret J., as he then was, at page 17, expressed the same view:\nThe powers conferred upon the Governor in Council by the War Measures Act constitute a law making authority, an authority to pass legislative enactments such as should be deemed necessary and advisable by reasons of war; and, when acting within those limits, the Governor in Council is vested with plenary powers of legislation as large and of the same nature as those of Parliament itself (Lord Selborne in The Queen v. Burah (1878) 3 App. Cas. 889). Within the ambit of the Act by which his authority is measured, the Governor in Council is given the same authority as is vested in Parliament itself. He has been given a lawmaking power.\nThe conditions of a valid enactment under the War Measures Act prescribed by the Act itself are two; first, there must be in existence a real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection; and secondly, the Governor in Council must by reason of such real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection deem the enactment necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada. It is to be noted that the objects specified are not confined to the prosecution of the war. Once the conditions prescribed by the Act have been complied with it is not open to the Court to question the validity of an Order in Council under the War Measures Act on the ground that the enactment was not in fact necessary or advisable for the objects specified. At page 12, Duff C.J. put the proposition in these terms:\nThe enactment is, of course, of the highest political nature. It is the attribution to the Executive Government of powers legislative in their character, described in terms implying nothing less than a plenary discretion, for securing the safety of the country in time of war. Subject only to the fundamental conditions explained above, (and the specific provisions enumerated), when Regulations have been passed by the Governor General in Council in professed fulfilment of his statutory duty, I cannot agree that it is competent to any court to canvass the considerations which have, or may have, led him to deem such Regulations necessary or advisable for the transcendent objects set forth. The authority and the duty of passing on that question are committed to those who are responsible for the security of the country \u0026mdash; the Executive Government itself, under, I repeat, its responsibility to Parliament. The words are too plain for dispute: the measures authorized are such as the Governor in Council (not the courts) deems necessary or advisable.\nAnd, as Rinfret J. said, at page 19:\nFor a court to review the enactment would be to assume the role of legislator.\nThe matter is, I think, conclusively settled by the Reference re Persons of Japanese Race . There Rinfret C.J., speaking also for Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. and referring to the Orders in Council that were the subject of the reference, said, at page 277:\nThe Governor in Council was the sole judge of the necessity or advisability of these measures and it is not competent to any Court to canvass the considerations which may have led the Governor in Council to deem such orders necessary or advisable for the objectives set forth.\nAnd, at page 285, Rand J. made it clear that it was not for the courts to substitute their view of any such necessity or advisability for that of the Governor in Council. And when the matter came before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council , Lord Wright, at page 586, said:\nIt is not pertinent to the judiciary to consider the wisdom or propriety of the particular policy which is embodied in the emergency legislation. Determination of the policy to be followed is exclusively a matter for the Parliament of the Dominion and those to whom it has delegated its powers\nThe same thought was forcefully expressed by the English Court of Appeal in R. v. Comptroller of Patents. In that case His Majesty in Council was given power by the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, to make such orders as appeared to him necessary or expedient for securing public safety, the defence of the realm, the maintenance of public order, the efficient prosecution of the war and for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community, and under this power a regulation was passed enabling the Comptroller of Patents to suspend the trade mark rights of British subjects operating enemy owned patents. The regulation was objected to on the grounds that it was outside the war purposes to which the power conferred by the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, was confined. The contention was thus very similar to that put forward for the suppliants in the present case. It did not prevail. Scott L.J. said, at page 681:\nthe effect of the words \u0026ldquo;as appears to him to be necessary or expedient\u0026rdquo; is, in my opinion, to give to His Majesty in Council, as the authority for passing the delegated legislation, a complete discretion entrusted to him by Parliament to decide what regulations are necessary for the purposes named in the subsection. If so, is not open to His Majesty\u0026rsquo;s Courts to investigate the question as to whether or not it was in fact necessary or expedient for the purposes named to make the regulations which were made.\nAnd Clauson L.J., at page 683, put it very clearly:\nthe criterion whether or not His Majesty had power to make a particular regulation is not whether that regulation is necessary or expedient for the purpose named, but whether it appears to His Majesty to be necessary or expedient for the purposes named to make the particular regulation.\nAnd then said, at page 684:\nIf my view as to the construction of the Act and the effect of it is correct, it is quite clear that it is wholly irrelevant to discuss before this court whether the regulation was in fact necessary or expedient for securing the public safety and so forth. It is a wholly irrelevant matter and with that we have nothing to do. His Majesty has formed the view that it was necessary or expedient. So far as this court is concerned, in my judgment, there is an end to the matter.\nIn the present case, the two conditions of jurisdiction prescribed by the War Measures Act have both been satisfied. It is, therefore, not open to the Court to question the validity of the Order in Council empowering the Custodian to sell the properties vested in him on the ground that such sale was not necessary for the purposes mentioned in the War Measures Act. Parliament has left the decision as to the necessity or advisability of such an order for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada, not to the Court, but to the Governor in Council, and once the Governor in Council has made his decision that the order is necessary or advisable for any of the purposes mentioned that is the end of the matter. The Court has no right to substitute its opinion of what is necessary or advisable for that of the Governor in Council or to question the validity of an order so made. The only authority that can validly challenge the exercise by the Governor in Council of the legislative powers entrusted to him is Parliament itself. If Parliament considers that he has acted erroneously the corrective power is in its hands \u0026mdash; it does not lie with the Courts.\nIt was, therefore, within the power of the Governor in Council to pass Order in Council P.C. 469, of January 19, 1943, embodying the terms against which the suppliants protest and they were validly enacted. The Custodian has, therefore, the lawful right to liquidate, sell, or otherwise dispose of the property vested in him, including the properties of the suppliants.\nOnly a brief reference need be made to another argument advanced on behalf of the suppliants. It was contended that they had handed their properties over to the Custodian voluntarily on the strength of the first two Orders in Council under which they were to be vested in him as a protective measure only for his control and management; that this fact constituted a contract with the Crown under which rights had accrued to the suppliants that the Crown would hold the properties for them pursuant to the Orders in Council: and that it was not competent for the Governor in Council to authorize the Custodian to sell the properties since this would affect accrued rights and would amount to a breach of contract. Apart altogether from my view that counsel for the suppliants has taken too narrow a view of the words \u0026ldquo;as a protective measure only\u0026rdquo; in the Order in Council I find no merit in law in his argument based on contract and accrued rights. In my view, there was no contract, express or implied, between the suppliants and either the Crown or the Custodian by reason of the signing of the \u0026ldquo;JP\u0026rdquo; forms. The properties became vested in the Custodian not by any contract but pursuant to the Orders in Council and would have vested in the Custodian whether the suppliants had signed the forms referred to or not. Moreover, I repeat, the vesting was the result of a legislative enactment, not of an executive act. The Crown never held the properties and no rights against the Crown had ever accrued to the suppliants in respect of them.\nSince the suppliants\u0026rsquo; whole case depends on the assumption that the Custodian is the servant or agent of the Crown and has no right to sell the suppliants\u0026rsquo; properties and such assumption is unsound their case falls to the ground. It is, therefore, unnecessary in these proceedings to deal with a number of matters referred to in the pleadings and raised in argument such as whether the Crown or the Custodian is a trustee of the properties in question and, if so, for whom and subject to what conditions, or whether declaratory orders of the kind sought for can or should be given. If, as I have held, the Custodian does not hold the properties of the suppliants as the servant or agent of the Crown, such questions cannot arise as against the Crown, and so far as the Custodian is concerned they cannot be dealt with in these proceedings since he is not a party to them.\nIn the result the answer to the question of law submitted to the Court is \u0026mdash; No. That being so, there is no object in proceeding to the trial of the petitions and the judgment of the Court must be that the suppliants are not entitled to any of the relief sought by them in their petitions of right. In each case, the respondent is entitled to costs.\n"},{"id":133,"href":"/casebook/relationships/netukulimk/","title":"Netukulimk","section":"Chapter 1","content":"Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw legal traditions and Netukulimk\nThe relationship between the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq and the forest ecosystem is more intimate than suggested in court. It is foundational to their worldview, integral to their legal traditions, and constitutional rights. This evidence was not before the courts, but it would have been useful to the courts if properly presented as part of Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq constitutional law, as well as the foundation of aboriginal and treaty rights as constitutional law of Canada. The relationship between the forest and Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq people is deeply embodied in the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq knowledge system and legal traditions, a relationship beginning with the Creation story.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nProper judicial consideration of Indigenous knowledge, legal traditions, languages and culture opens up the courts to a better understanding of aboriginal rights. These Indigenous evidences offer deep internal meanings that can be quite valuable to the clarification of aboriginal and treaty rights.However, such evidences cannot be learned in books; they are part of the language and oral traditions. It is in the places where Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq gather, such as in ceremonies, Sweat Lodges, cultural meetings, births, wakes and funerals, and visiting Elders, that this knowledge and law are transmitted. These sources are still unfamiliar to the existing rules of evidence and judges have difficulty in comprehending them and giving them proper weight.\nMi\u0026rsquo;kmaw oral teachings, legal tradition, and ceremonies involve legends, stories, teachings of advisors, and narratives handed down through the generations. They are neither linear nor steeped in theories of historical or social progress and evolution. It is not a human-centred narrative, and it does not assume that human beings are anything more than one element in the natural order of the ecosystem.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe creation story of the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw establishes the relations between the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq and their ecology; it also generates Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw knowledge and legal traditions behind their aboriginal and treaty rights. Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq knowledge is at the root of the oral tradition and ceremonies and in the teachings, stories, and performances that are passed down from generation to generation.\nThe teaching of creation among the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq, which also creates their legal traditions, begins with the life-giver, Kisu\u0026rsquo;ulk, who generates the first bolts of lightning that unfold the grandfather sun (Naku\u0026rsquo;set), the dry Mother earth (Wsitqamu\u0026rsquo;k), the organism that generates the atmosphere (Kluskap), and unfolds its great cycles of nature. These lessons create the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw legal traditions and law of netukulimk.\nThe spark people or fire peoples created the ancestors of the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq who awoke in the world, ignorant of everything in it. Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw teachings say the people asked the life-giver how they should live. They were told to watch the sun, sky, and water and lands in the environment, and told to learn from the animals, fish, birds and the plants. They learned how and when to pray, to respect the nations of animals and fish, and to respect the nations of the trees and their dependents; they learned the vitality of the stars, the constellations, and the Milky Way, which is the path their spirits take to the other world. Most important of all lessons, they learned to live together as one people, kinuk, in harmony with all other humans, animals, and plants.\nThrough the endless process of transmission of knowledge and ceremonies, the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq come to understand their values and responsibilities to the environment and families. Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw knowledge is centred on the process of sustaining a shared worldview, a cognitive solidarity, and a tradition of responsible action that combines the teaching of rights with responsibilities. The aboriginal land tenure and rights derived from netukulimk cannot be separated from their sovereignty or governance or law of the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw territory. Netukulimk and its laws are not based on race. It is usually based on kinship ties, specialized access to resources, and a high degree of equality and diversity. Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq do not speak of living \u0026ldquo;there\u0026rdquo;; rather, each family or person \u0026ldquo;belongs\u0026rdquo; to a family and a space or territory. Belonging is a special responsibility of Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw sovereignty, governance, and the law of netukulimk shapes other laws, legal choices, and placement. Ultimately, the law of netukulimk affirms the value of sharing as a standard of life.\nNetukulimk is the responsibility to maintain the ecology and the human order using the principles of belonging and respect. It refers to the responsibilities and actions of the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw, thus it has been translated into human kinship relationships as a general analogy for ecological relations. The Grandmother and the Marten generate the relationship of life within the territory of the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq, the Nephew generates the relationship between life within the sea and the rivers of the territory, and the Mother generates the relationship between the plant lives within the territory. The Creation story thus animates the relationships central to how the Court has affirmed these relationships as aboriginal and treaty rights in Simon, Marshall, and Sappier-Gray. In Simon, the Court affirmed the harvest to hunt land life; in Marshall the right to harvest the sea life; in Sappier-Gray, the Court affirmed the right to harvest the trees. These cases generate a modern constitutional jurisgenesis that is harmonious with the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq creation narrative.\nIn the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw legal traditions, netukulimk has always been expressed as the legal processes of sustaining relationships or what is called in the English land tenure system, conservation or sustainability. Consistent with the verb-oriented reality enfolded in the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw language\u0026ndash;a process of being with the universe\u0026ndash;netukulink was (and is) a widely shared, dynamic, and interrelated worldview that connects all things. The system of kinship relations unites everyone in a web of complementary rights and responsibilities. This order is non-hierarchical and reproduces itself without the need to accumulate more people, more land, or more goods. The most obvious and widespread manifestation of this reciprocal relationship is the totemic clan system. The clan system categorizes respectful ecological relationships as well as legal obligations, such as sharing and deference. This is a shared responsibility with the netukulimk under Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw law. Conservation is an ambiguous constitutional category in Canada. It is not an express power of either the federal or provincial Crown, but it is linked to the aboriginal and treaty rights of the Mawio\u0026rsquo;mi;\u0026rsquo; its reconciliation is necessary for everyone.\nThe Sappier-Gray decision is a significant affirmation of another part of the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw legal tradition. It affirms the relationship of the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq to their environment in the form of plant life. This case begins to recognize constitutionally and affirm the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw relationship to the plant kingdom, the green growing entities that provide the atmosphere for the earth. It protects the knowledge of herbs and plants for different purposes. It affirms the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq creation story, and in this case represents the meaning of Nikanapekewisqw (Kluscap\u0026rsquo;s mother) who came from a leaf of a tree to bring the knowledge of how to sustain and harvest the plant kingdom. The Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq conceptualize plants and animals with a certain mntu (force) and consider them to be separate nations that are related to the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq. In an endless cycle, each life form is viewed as both a producer and a consumer with respect to the others. In the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw context, the right to harvest wood is part of the netukulimk, and is derived from pre-contact Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw legal traditions of the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq, or its pre-contact legal system.\nBoth the Mawio\u0026rsquo;mi in its Netuklimkewe\u0026rsquo;l declarations and the Crown express concern that recognition of conservation is needed to prevent the uncontrollable and excessive exploitation of the natural resources of Atlantic Canada. Netukulimk is the part of Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw constitutional law that inherently limits the quantities of those entitled to share in the various and seasonal harvests. In its previous analysis of the treaties with the Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw, the courts have found it is implied that the Crown recognized and accepted the existing Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaq way of life and that it agreed that they could continue their hunting, fishing and gathering lifestyle.\nSimilar to most forms of Indigenous knowledge, Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw knowledge and jurisprudence is based on an organic and knowable totality that is more important than any of its particular manifestations.\u0026quot; It is a complete system of knowledge with its own concepts of epistemology, and its own ways of knowing nature, events, ideas, and human consciousness. The diverse manifestations of this knowledge system can best be learned by means employed by Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw families, including language, ceremonies, practices, and teachings, and those who teach Mi\u0026rsquo;kmaw knowledge usually begin from a place where the land and its ecology are understood.\n"},{"id":134,"href":"/casebook/governance/noble/","title":"Noble et al v Alley","section":"Chapter 2","content":"This case addressed a discriminatory restrictive covenant attached to land forming part of a summer resort development called the Beach O\u0026rsquo;Pines. The covenant, in clause (f), prohibited the sale, transfer or lease of the land to, or use or occupancy by, individuals of Jewish \u0026ldquo;race or blood\u0026rdquo; or people of colour, and expressed an intention to restrict ownership of land in the resort development to \u0026ldquo;persons of the white or Caucasian race not excluded by this clause.\u0026rdquo;\nKerwin J. (concurring) \u0026ndash; # [\u0026hellip;]\nIn the Courts below emphasis was laid upon the decision of Mackay J. in Re Drummond Wren, and it was considered that the motion was confined to the consideration of whether that case, if rightly decided, covered the situation. The motion was for an order declaring that the objection to the covenant made on behalf of the purchaser had been fully answered by the vendor and that the same did not constitute a valid objection to the title or for such further and other order as might seem just. The objection was:\nREQUIRED in view of the fact that the purchaser herein might be considered as being of the Jewish race or blood, we require a release from the restrictions imposed in the said clause (f) and an order declaring that the restrictive covenant set out in the said clause (f) is void and of no effect.\nThe answer by the vendor was that the decision in Re Drummond Wren applied to the facts of the present sale with the result that clause (f) was invalid and the vendor and purchaser were not bound to observe it. In view of the wide terms of the notice of motion, the application is not restricted and it may be determined by a point taken before the Court of Appeal and this Court, if not before Mr. Justice Schroeder.\nThat point depends upon the meaning of the rule laid down in Tulk v. Moxhay. This was a decision of the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, affirming a decision of the Master of the Rolls. The judgment of the Master of the Rolls appears in 18 L.J.N.S. (Equity) 83, and the judgment of the Lord Chancellor is more fully reported there than in Phillips’ Reports. In the latter, the Lord Chancellor is reported as saying, page 777:\nThat this Court has jurisdiction to enforce a contract between the owner of land and his neighbour purchasing a part of it, that the latter shall either use or abstain from using the land purchased in a particular way, is what I never knew disputed.\nIn the Law Journal, the following appears at p. 87:\nI have no doubt whatever upon the subject; in short, I cannot have a doubt upon it, without impeaching what I have considered as the settled rule of this Court ever since I have known it. That this Court has authority to enforce a contract, which the owner of one piece of land may have entered into with his neighbour, founded, of course, upon good consideration, and valuable consideration, that he will either use or abstain from using his land in any manner that the other party by the contract stipulates shall be followed by the party who enters into the covenant, appears to me the very foundation of the whole of this jurisdiction. It has never, that I know of, been disputed.\nAt p. 88 of the Law Journal, the Lord Chancellor states that the jurisdiction of the Court was not fettered by the question whether the convent ran with the land or not but that the question was whether a party taking property, the vendor having stipulated in a manner, binding by the law and principles of the Court of Chancery to use it in a particular way will not be permitted to use it in a way diametrically opposite to that which the party has covenanted for. To the same effect is p. 778 of Phillips’s.\nIn view of these statements I am unable to gain any elucidation of the extent of the equitable doctrine from decisions at law such as Congleton v. Pattison and Rogers v. Hosegood. It is true that in the Court of Appeal, at p. 403, Collins L.J., after referring to extracts from the judgment of Sir George Jessel in London \u0026amp; South Western Ry. Co. v. Gomm, said at p. 405:\nThese observations, which are just as applicable to the benefit reserved as to the burden imposed, shew that in equity, just as at law, the first point to be determined is whether the covenant or contract in its inception binds the land. If it does, it is then capable of passing with the land to subsequent assignees; if it does not, it is incapable of passing by mere assignment of the land.\nThis, however, leaves untouched the problem as to when a covenant binds the land.\nWhatever the precise delimitation in the rule in Tulk v. Moxhay may be, counsel were unable to refer us to any case where it was applied to a covenant restricting the alienation of land to persons other than those of a certain race. Mr. Denison did refer to three decisions in Ontario: Essex Real Estate v. Holmes; Re Bryers and Morris; Re McDougall v. Waddell; but he was quite correct in stating that they were of no assistance. The holding in the first was merely that the purchaser of the land there in question did not fall within a certain prohibition. In the second an inquiry was directed, without more. In the third, all that was decided was that the provisions of s. 1 of The Racial Discrimination Act, 1944, (Ontario), c. 51 would not be violated by a deed containing a covenant on the part of the purchaser that certain lands or any buildings erected thereon should not at any time be sold to, let to or occupied by any person or persons other than Gentiles (non-semitic (sic)) of European or British or Irish or Scottish racial origin.\nIt was a forward step that the rigour of the common law should be softened by the doctrine expounded in Tulk v. Moxhay but it would be an unwarrantable extension of that doctrine to hold, from anything that was said in that case or in subsequent cases that the covenant here in question has any reference to the use, or abstention from use, of land. Even if decisions upon the common law could be prayed in aid, there are none that go to the extent claimed in the present case.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal. There should be no costs of the original motions in the Supreme Court of Ontario.\nRand J. (majority) — # Covenants enforceable under the rule of Tulk v. Moxhay, are properly conceived as running with the land in equity and, by reason of their enforceability, as constituting an equitable servitude or burden on the servient land. The essence of such an incident is that it should touch or concern the land as contradistinguished from a collateral effect. In that sense, it is a relation between parcels, annexed to them and, subject to the equitable rule of notice, passing with them both as to benefit and burden in transmissions by operation of law as well as by act of the parties.\nBut by its language, the covenant here is directed not to the land or to some mode of its use, but to transfer by act of the purchaser; its scope does not purport to extend to a transmission by law to a person within the banned class. If, for instance, the grantee married a member of that class, it is not suggested that the ordinary inheritance by a child of the union would be affected. Not only, then, it is not a covenant touching or concerning the land, but by its own terms it fails in annexation to the land. The respondent owners are, therefore, without any right against the proposed vendor.\nOn its true interpretation, the covenant is a restraint on alienation. The grantor company which has disposed of all its holdings in the sub-division has admittedly ceased to carry on business and by force of the provisions of The Companies’ Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 251, s. 28 its powers have become forfeited; but by ss. (4) they may, on such conditions as may be exacted, be revived by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. Assuming the grantor would otherwise be entitled to enforce the covenant in equity against the original covenantor—and if he would not the point falls—it becomes necessary to deal with the question whether for the purposes of specific performance the covenant is unenforceable for uncertainty.\nIt is in these words: See clause (f) p—?\nThe lands and premises herein described shall never be sold, assigned, transferred, leased, rented or in any manner whatsoever alienated to, and shall never be occupied or used in any manner whatsoever by any person of the Jewish, Hebrew, Semitic, Negro or coloured race or blood, it being the intention and purpose of the Grantor, to restrict the ownership, use, occupation and enjoyment of the said recreational development, including the lands and premises herein described, to persons of white or Caucasian race not excluded by this clause.\nIf this language were in the form of a condition, the holding in Clayton v. Ramsden, would be conclusive against its sufficiency. In that case the House of Lords dealt with a condition in a devise by which the donee became divested if she should marry a person “not of Jewish parentage and of the Jewish faith” and held it void for uncertainty. I am unable to distinguish the defect in that language from what we have here: it is impossible to set such limits to the lines of race or blood as would enable a court to say in all cases whether a proposed purchaser is or is not within the ban. As put by Lord Cranworth in Clavering v. Ellison, at p. 289 the condition “must be such that the Court can see from the beginning, precisely and distinctly, upon the happening of what event it was that the preceding estate was to determine.”\nThe effect of the covenant, if enforceable, would be to annex a partial inalienability as an equitable incident of the ownership, to nullify an area of proprietary powers.\nIn both cases there is the removal of part of the power to alienate; and I can see no ground of distinction between the certainty required in the one case and that of the other. The uncertainty is, then, fatal to the validity of the covenant before us as a defect of or objection to the title.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct judgment to the effect that the covenant is not an objection to the title of the proposed vendor, with costs to the appellants in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n"},{"id":135,"href":"/casebook/governance/nafta/","title":"North American Free Trade Agreement, Article 1110","section":"Chapter 2","content":" Article 1110: Expropriation and Compensation # 1 No Party may directly or indirectly nationalize or expropriate an investment of an investor of another Party in its territory or take a measure tantamount to nationalization or expropriation of such an investment (\u0026ldquo;expropriation\u0026rdquo;), except:\n(a) for a public purpose;\n(b) on a non-discriminatory basis;\n(c) in accordance with due process of law and Article 1105(1); and\n(d) on payment of compensation in accordance with paragraphs 2 through 6.\n"},{"id":136,"href":"/casebook/governance/nuisance-as-right-to-exclude/","title":"Nuisance in Property Law","section":"Chapter 2","content":"One right in particular, some argue, is fundamental to private property: the right to exclude others from interfering with the owner\u0026rsquo;s use and enjoyment of their land, other tangible things and even intangibles like knowledge goods. The common law has devised several remedies to enforce owners\u0026rsquo; right to exclude. We have already seen two examples of this. In Harrison v Carswell, the mall owner brought an action in trespass against the picketer Sophie Carswell to exclude her from the mall sidewalk, while the plaintiff in Moore made a claim in conversion in his attempt to exclude the defendants from using his cells after they were extracted from his body. Both of these are causes of action in tort designed to protect the right to exclude.\nThere is a third type of tort action that engages owners\u0026rsquo; rights to exclude, but also—reciprocally—other owners\u0026rsquo; rights to use their property as they wish: an action in nuisance. We will explore nuisance law as a \u0026ldquo;property tort\u0026rdquo; for what it can tell us about how judges in the mode of classical legal thought address the clash of private property rights between neighbours and to what extent courts were willing to enforce an owner\u0026rsquo;s right to exclude.\nOur focus is on just one aspect of nuisance doctrine: the question of remedy. Once a nuisance has been established on the facts (as it is in all the cases we\u0026rsquo;ll study in this course), should courts grant an injunction to prevent the nuisance-causing activity or should courts award damages to compensate the plaintiff for their losses? The former option most effectively enforces the owner\u0026rsquo;s right to exclude, while the latter forces the owner to accept payment for an ongoing violation of that right.\nNuisance Law in an Industrializing Canada # Canada Paper Company, Windsor Mills, QC, 1909.

As Jennifer Nedelsky explains:1\nBy the late nineteenth century, industrialization and urbanization were changing the shape of Canadian society: between 1880 and 1920 the population doubled from 3,689,257 to 8,788,483; 74.35 per cent of the population were classified as rural by the census of Canada in 1881; by 1921 the percentage had decreased to 50.48. Capital investment in manufactures increased from $165,302,632 in 1880 to $2,923,667,011 in 1920 and the gross value of all manufactured products from $469,847,886 in 1880 to $3,706,544,997 in 1920. Manufacturing, once diffused, was concentrating in industrial towns. Factories increasingly replaced small workshops, and steam-powered engines brought noise as well as productivity. As the nuisances of industrialization increased, so did the costs of eliminating them. Manufacturing establishments, for example, were becoming sufficiently large and important to local economies that ordering them to take their nuisances elsewhere would have had serious consequences.\nLike their English and American counterparts before them, common law courts in Canada struggled to adjudicate nuisance claims in this evolving context, which often pitted the demands of business and the growing influence of industry against the traditional property rights of neighbouring landowners. However, because industrialization came relatively late to Canada, Canadian courts confronted nuisance cases against the background of legal principles already developed elsewhere. A key question became whether Canadian courts would follow these established precedents—primarily from England—or chart their own path tailored to the Canadian context.\nThe legal question of what remedy the Canadian courts should apply in cases where a nuisance had already been proven by the plaintiff was a key point of conflict between industrialists and their neighbours. The English Court of Appeal\u0026rsquo;s decision in Shelfer v City of London Electrical Lighting Co. loomed large here. Traditionally, the common law afforded heavy priority to the absolute protection of private owners rights to use and enjoy their property, enforced by way of an injunction against the offending activities of neighbouring landowners. Industrialization brought increasing pressure on judges to soften this traditional bias in favour of injunctions and to allow for an award of damages in some cases. In Shelfer, the Court introduced a legal test that was apparently intended to give judges a workable guide for determining when damages were appropriate in lieu of an injunction.\nThe brief excerpt below from Shelfer reviews this legal test on remedy in nuisance. To what extent does the Shelfer test help to clarify when a landowner\u0026rsquo;s right to exclude should be enforced versus when a court should sanction a \u0026ldquo;paid-for\u0026rdquo; infringement of that right by awarding damages?\nNuisance and the Classical Style # The test crafted by the English Court of Appeal in Shelfer was\u0026ndash;as Lord Justice Smith himself seems to acknowledge\u0026ndash;highly indeterminate. It left subsequent judicial decisions, and parties to a dispute, open to considerable uncertainty about the the circumstances under which a landowner\u0026rsquo;s right to exclude others from their land would be strictly enforced.\nOur objective this week is to investigate how Canadian common law judges working in the classical style worked to address the indeterminacy created by Shelfer. In the two cases below — Black v Canadian Copper Co. and Canada Paper Co. v Brown — the judges are confronted with what looks like very similar facts: large-scale industrial pollution causing damage to close-by private landowners. And yet, the judges reach quite different conclusions on the question of appropriate remedy.\nAs you read these two cases against one another, ask yourself how the judges draw on classical common law reasoning to reach their decisions. In what ways do the judges interpret some land uses as \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; and other \u0026ldquo;unnatural\u0026rdquo; and what role does this framing play in the decisions? Are you persuaded that one case is correctly decided and the other wrongly decided?

What responsibilities do you encounter as you try to understanding and complete your weekly readings (and to whom)? Below are some further questions to help guide your reflections. Take around ten minutes to make a list of all the relevant obligations that come to your mind in this context.\nCommunity: Do you hold any obligations to your family, friends, classmates, teachers, employers (present or future), or other groups or individuals when working in this course?\nPlace: Do you feel any obligations relating to places you are from or have lived in? Any obligations coming from the place or spaces we are learning property law in?\nSelf: Do you feel any obligations to yourself, your own morals or beliefs when you think about learning property law?\nSTOP: Don\u0026rsquo;t read further until you have completed your initial list of obligations.\nNow think about how some of your different obligations might conflict with one another. Pick one obligation from your list and imagine that it is the only one you hold. How would you approach this course if you only had to worry about that single obligation? Would your approach change if you introduced an additional obligation from your list? How? Take another ten minutes to identify and write down any conflicts or tensions that appear once you examine your obligations in relation to one another.\nTo help guide you in this exercise, consider the following example:\nAs your professor in this course\u0026ndash;who decides what to teach and how to teach it\u0026ndash;I hold an obligation to ensure that you gain \u0026ldquo;a general understanding of the core legal concepts applicable to the practice of law in Canada\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;an understanding of the principles that apply to private relationships\u0026rdquo; in the field of property law. That obligation is defined, and to a degree monitored, by the Federation of Law Societies of Canada through their National Requirement. It is an obligation that I owe to you as students, to your future clients and colleagues, and to institutions including the law school and the law society. I also hold an obligation to ensure that you gain a critical understanding of how the everyday application of property law principles contributes to the dispossession of Indigenous communities. That obligation is not mentioned anywhere in the National Requirement but is inherent in a commitment to sustain and repair relationships created by the Peace and Friendship Treaties. If I had only one or the other of these obligations to satisfy, I would teach two very different courses. Time and resource constraints often make it challenging to satisfy both of these obligations at once, but there are also deeper conflicts that arise, including between legal principles or rules across different legal orders. I am also limited and biased by my own knowledge, background and training.\nPlease complete this exercise on your own before class.

But during this period the Proclamation itself received little to no scrutiny in the common law courts. This changed dramatically when the Chancery Division of the High Court of Ontario issued its decision in St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling and Lumber Co. v R in 1886, followed by subsequent appeals all the way to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council—at that time, Canada\u0026rsquo;s highest court of appeal. The case would chart the course for the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title in Canada for well into the next century.\nSet in the two decades after Confederation in 1867, the background dispute in St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling between the Province of Ontario and the Dominion Government (Canada) was nominally about which level of government held title to public lands within the geographic boundaries of Ontario that had—according to Canada\u0026rsquo;s interpretation of treaty rights—been ceded to the Crown by the Saulteaux (Nahkawininiwak) of the Anishinaabe Nation as part of Treaty 3 (the North-West Angle Treaty). In the course of trying to resolve that dispute, the common law courts pronounced on the nature of Aboriginal title in ways that had far-reaching consequences. At issue in St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling is not the courts\u0026rsquo; interpretation of Treaty 3 rights, but of the land rights that preceded that treaty as a matter of the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title.\nTo understand St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling and is implications, it is important to appreciate the context in which the question of Aboriginal title came before the courts. As Kent McNeil observes in his history of the case, \u0026ldquo;[t]he 1880s were years of adversity and deprivation for Indigenous peoples, who were facing the unrelenting advance of imperialism in various parts of the world.\u0026rdquo;1 \u0026ldquo;During the same period,\u0026rdquo; McNeil writes, \u0026ldquo;the taking of Indigenous lands, suppression of Indigenous political authority, and forced assimilation were also proceeding in Canada,\u0026rdquo;2 underpinned by the rising prominence of social darwinism and by westward economic expansion and resulting, among other abuses, in the creation of the residential school system.\nThe Facts and Law in St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling # The facts and law in this case are reasonably complicated. Essentially, the case involves an underlying dispute between the Province of Ontario and the Dominion Government (Canada) about who is entitled to use and gain revenue from public lands within the political boundaries of Ontario. Understanding the factual and legal context of the case is a useful exercise in learning how to make sense of a complex legal setting across multiple judicial decisions. Here, I will aim to sketch the outlines of that context to help you interpret the case.\nFor our purposes, the main legal dispute in St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling turns on the interpretation of Section 109 of the Constitution Act, 1867. That provision reads:\nAll Lands, Mines, Minerals, and Royalties belonging to the several Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick at the Union, and all Sums then due or payable for such Lands, Mines, Minerals, or Royalties, shall belong to the several Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any Trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any Interest other than that of the Province in the same. In effect, Section 109 says that any legal entitlements in land \u0026ldquo;belonging to\u0026rdquo; the former Province of Canada prior to 1867 (i.e. in lands not held by private interests or otherwise taken up) passed to the Province of Ontario at Confederation. The question in St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling was therefore whether or not the rights in land at issue\u0026ndash;those that would be subject to Treaty 3 after 1873\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;belonged to\u0026rdquo; the the former Province of Canada before 1867. Lord Watson, in his decision for the Privy Council, refers to these rights as the \u0026ldquo;beneficial interest\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;beneficial title\u0026rdquo;) in the lands, as distinguished from the underlying or radical title, which is held by the Crown.\nSt. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling and Lumber Company, the defendant, argued that these land rights did not \u0026ldquo;belong\u0026rdquo; to the Province of Canada prior to 1867, because title to those lands was held by the Saulteaux as Aboriginal title\u0026ndash;a form of title recognized in and by the Royal Proclamation. The fact of Aboriginal title meant that the land rights did not \u0026ldquo;belong\u0026rdquo; to the Province of Canada and therefore could not have passed to Ontario by virtue of Section 109. It was this Aboriginal title, according to the defendant\u0026rsquo;s view, that was later ceded to the Crown through Treaty 3. On the basis of the \u0026ldquo;beneficial interest\u0026rdquo; acquired by Canada through Treaty 3, it granted licenses to the company to engage in forestry on the lands.\nThe defendant bolstered its argument about Section 109 of the Constitution Act, 1867 by citing another provision in that same Act, namely Section 91(24) which refers to Canada\u0026rsquo;s jurisdiction over \u0026ldquo;lands reserved for the Indians\u0026rdquo;. The basic argument here is that lands subject to Aboriginal title fall within Section 91(24) and are consequently excluded from Section 109.\nOntario disagreed with the defendant\u0026rsquo;s interpretation of the law, arguing that on \u0026ldquo;unceded\u0026rdquo; lands prior to 1867, the beneficial interest in the lands was not held by the Saulteaux under any recognized form of common law title and therefore \u0026ldquo;belonged to\u0026rdquo; the Province of Canada, passing to Ontario at Confederation. This argument required Ontario to deny that Aboriginal title is or should be considered a recognized legal interest in land capable of displacing a province\u0026rsquo;s beneficial interest.\nWhile the dispute in the case is one about the respective entitlements of Ontario and Canada, we are reading the judgments below in order to understand how the judges\u0026rsquo; reasons shaped the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title. As it turns out, the answer to the question, \u0026ldquo;What is Aboriginal title and what is its source?\u0026rdquo; becomes central to resolving the case. At the same time, it is obvious that the Indigenous communities whose rights were at stake were not actually parties to the case. As becomes clear from the judgments, Indigenous voices and interests were entirely absent in the early development of a legal doctrine that would come to have such enormous significance for Indigenous peoples and communities.\nProcedurally, Ontario succeeds at trial before Chancellor Boyd in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Ontario and in every appeal of that decision that follows. In addition to Chancellor Boyd\u0026rsquo;s decision, we will read Justice Strong\u0026rsquo;s dissenting judgement at the Supreme Court of Canada and Lord Watson\u0026rsquo;s decision upon final appeal to the Privy Council in 1888. Each judge approaches the issue of Aboriginal title from a different perspective, and by reading these decisions together we can gain a much deeper understanding of how classical legal thought has shaped common law principles about Indigenous land rights.\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; The Many \u0026ldquo;Forms\u0026rdquo; of Title # Last week, we distinguished between possession as control and title as the legal recognition of ownership. One of the fundamental premises of Locke\u0026rsquo;s theory of property was that\u0026ndash;through the exertion of one\u0026rsquo;s labour\u0026ndash;possession can and often does serve as the basis for legally-protected title.\nAs you read the various decisions in St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling this week, you will notice that\u0026ndash;on the way to interpreting what Aboriginal title \u0026ldquo;is\u0026rdquo; in the common law world view\u0026ndash;the judges apparently describe several different forms of \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo;. There are a number of complexities here that we won\u0026rsquo;t delve into, but it is important for our purposes at this point in the course to distinguish between what the judges call \u0026ldquo;underlying\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;radical\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;ultimate\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;paramount\u0026rdquo;) title on the one hand and \u0026ldquo;beneficial\u0026rdquo; title on the other.\nUnderlying title to land derives from something called the common law doctrine of tenure\u0026ndash;the feudal system of landholding premised on the idea that all legal rights in land are ultimately held \u0026ldquo;of\u0026rdquo; (i.e., subservient to) the Crown. According to this doctrine of tenure, property rights in land in the common law system are never absolute, but are always subject to some deeper or more fundamental legal interest that resides in the Crown.\nBeneficial title is an aspect of the property that sits atop the underlying title and is a title that affords its holder the benefits of ownership (for example, the revenue from cutting the timber that grows there or other benefits from making use of the land). According to this system of interconnected legal rights, it is possible and in fact quite normal for the owner of beneficial title (such as a private person) to be different from the owner of the underlying title (generally, the Crown).\nIt is largely accepted in St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling that common law Aboriginal title is not an underlying title. If anything, the judges say, Aboriginal title is a form of beneficial title in land (and some reject even this interpretation). In addition to questions about the nature and source of Aboriginal title at common law we might, of course, ask how the British Crown ever came to acquire the underlying title to lands in what is now called Canada in the first place. This is a question that some courts have answered by turning to the doctrine of discovery and the idea of terra nullius, which asserts that the Crown acquired sovereignty in North America as a matter of international law between European powers that applied to the \u0026ldquo;discovery\u0026rdquo; of lands where there were no recognized systems of pre-existing law. We will discuss this aspect of the common law and its influence on the subsequent development of Aboriginal title in later weeks.\n\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Kent McNeil, Flawed Precedent: the St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s case and Aboriginal title (Vancouver: UBC Press, 2019), 8.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIbid., 9.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":140,"href":"/problems/parking-chairs/","title":"Parking Chairs","section":"Problems","content":" It was undisputed in Asher that Thomas Williamson had come into possession of the land at issue by \u0026ldquo;inclosing\u0026rdquo; it—presumably, by building a fence or erecting some other sort of boundary marker (as well as constructing a cottage on it).

What other practices do we understand as signalling possession? Are these practices always meant to be recognized in the eyes of the law, or do they have other audiences?\nFor example, in some cities in the United States—famously, Chicago—it is common practice for residents who dig out public street parking spaces after a snow storm to place a chair in the spot while their car is away.

Patents given their \u0026ldquo;owners\u0026rdquo; a time-limited, exclusive right to make, construct, use and sell the subject matter of the patent.\nThe basic rationale behind patent rights is one about economic incentives. As an intangible good, the inventive idea or design that motivates a patent is by nature non-excludable: once the invention has been created and made public, it is essentially costless for others to reproduce that idea or design in order to make their own products. Because inventions often require considerable up-front and sometimes risky investments, the rationale goes, exclusive patent protections are needed in order provide creators with sufficient financial incentives to create in the first place. According to this argument, if the right to exclude via patent did not exists, creators would have no motivation to produce their intentions and society would suffer as a result.\nWhile a large body of recent research and thinking in the field of intellectual property law has explored other, non-financial reasons why creators produce a whole range of cultural and scientific products, the central economic rationale described above remains at the heart of modern patent law in Canada.\nNotice that this rationale for patent rights is heavily functionalist in character: patents exist—and are enforced by the courts—explicitly to structure and incentivize individual behaviour.\nPatents in Hollywood # The film PERCY, released in 2020 and starring Christopher Walken, dramatized the events behind Monstanto v Schmeiser.

In turn, the British were becoming increasingly motivated to forge friendly relationships with the Wabanaki as counter-weight to French power. This period culminated in the signing of the Treaty of 1725 by various parties between that year and 1726.\nIt is important to distinguish the 1725 treaty from what are sometimes called the \u0026ldquo;numbered treaties\u0026rdquo;—one of which was in issue in St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling. While the latter treaties have been interpreted by common law courts as \u0026ldquo;land cession\u0026rdquo; treaties in which First Nations ceded their land rights to the Crown, the 1725 treaty and subsequent treaties in Atlantic Canada are understood as treaties in which the Indigenous signatories did not cede any of their land rights or their authority to govern their lands.\nA general word of caution when reading these treaty documents: the interpretation of historical treaties is a complex exercise.

The bill sets out a deed executed by the Coal Company in 1878, under which the plaintiffs claim. The deed conveys the surface, but, in express terms, reserves the right to remove all the coal under the same, and the grantee takes the premises with the risk, and waives all claim for damages that may arise from mining out the coal. But the plaintiffs say that, whatever may have been the Coal Company\u0026rsquo;s rights, they were taken away by an Act of Pennsylvania, approved May 27, 1921, P.L. 1198, commonly known there as the Kohler Act. The Court of Common Pleas found that, if not restrained, the defendant would cause the damage to prevent which the bill was brought, but denied an injunction, holding that the statute, if applied to this case, would be unconstitutional. On appeal, the Supreme Court of the State agreed that the defendant had contract and property rights protected by the Constitution of the United States, but held that the statute was a legitimate exercise of the police power, and directed a decree for the plaintiffs. A writ of error was granted bringing the case to this Court.\nThe statute forbids the mining of anthracite coal in such way as to cause the subsidence of, among other things, any structure used as a human habitation, with certain exceptions, including among them land where the surface is owned by the owner of the underlying coal and is distant more than one hundred and fifty feet from any improved property belonging to any other person. As applied to this case, the statute is admitted to destroy previously existing rights of property and contract. The question is whether the police power can be stretched so far.\nGovernment hardly could go on if, to some extent, values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law. As long recognized, some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation, and must yield to the police power. But obviously the implied limitation must have its limits, or the contract and due process clauses are gone. One fact for consideration in determining such limits is the extent of the diminution. When it reaches a certain magnitude, in most if not in all cases, there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to sustain the act. So the question depends upon the particular facts. The greatest weight is given to the judgment of the legislature, but it always is open to interested parties to contend that the legislature has gone beyond its constitutional power.\nThis is the case of a single private house. No doubt there is a public interest even in this, as there is in every purchase and sale and in all that happens within the commonwealth. Some existing rights may be modified even in such a case. Rideout v. Knox, 148 Mass. 368. But usually, in ordinary private affairs, the public interest does not warrant much of this kind of interference. A source of damage to such a house is not a public nuisance even if similar damage is inflicted on others in different places. The damage is not common or public. Wesson v. Washburn Iron Co., 13 Allen 95, 103. The extent of the public interest is shown by the statute to be limited, since the statute ordinarily does not apply to land when the surface is owned by the owner of the coal. Furthermore, it is not justified as a protection of personal safety. That could be provided for by notice. Indeed, the very foundation of this bill is that the defendant gave timely notice of its intent to mine under the house. On the other hand, the extent of the taking is great. It purports to abolish what is recognized in Pennsylvania as an estate in land \u0026ndash; a very valuable estate \u0026ndash; and what is declared by the Court below to be a contract hitherto binding the plaintiffs. If we were called upon to deal with the plaintiffs\u0026rsquo; position alone, we should think it clear that the statute does not disclose a public interest sufficient to warrant so extensive a destruction of the defendant\u0026rsquo;s constitutionally protected rights.\nBut the case has been treated as one in which the general validity of the act should be discussed. The Attorney General of the State, the City of Scranton, and the representatives of other extensive interests were allowed to take part in the argument below, and have submitted their contentions here. It seems, therefore, to be our duty to go farther in the statement of our opinion, in order that it may be known at once, and that further suits should not be brought in vain.\nIt is our opinion that the act cannot be sustained as an exercise of the police power, so far as it affects the mining of coal under streets or cities in places where the right to mine such coal has been reserved. As said in a Pennsylvania case, \u0026ldquo;For practical purposes, the right to coal consists in the right to mine it.\u0026rdquo; Commonwealth v. Clearview Coal Co., 256 Pa.St. 328, 331. What makes the right to mine coal valuable is that it can be exercised with profit. To make it commercially impracticable to mine certain coal has very nearly the same effect for constitutional purposes as appropriating or destroying it. This we think that we are warranted in assuming that the statute does.\nIt is true that, in Plymouth Coal Co. v. Pennsylvania, 232 U. S. 531, it was held competent for the legislature to require a pillar of coal to the left along the line of adjoining property, that with the pillar on the other side of the line would be a barrier sufficient for the safety of the employees of either mine in case the other should be abandoned and allowed to fill with water. But that was a requirement for the safety of employees invited into the mine, and secured an average reciprocity of advantage that has been recognized as a justification of various laws.\nThe rights of the public in a street purchased or laid out by eminent domain are those that it has paid for. If in any case its representatives have been so short sighted as to acquire only surface rights without the right of support, we see no more authority for supplying the latter without compensation than there was for taking the right of way in the first place and refusing to pay for it because the public wanted it very much. The protection of private property in the Fifth Amendment presupposes that it is wanted for public use, but provides that it shall not be taken for such use without compensation. A similar assumption is made in the decisions upon the Fourteenth Amendment. Hairston v. Danville \u0026amp; Western Ry. Co., 208 U. S. 598, 208 U. S. 605. When this seemingly absolute protection is found to be qualified by the police power, the natural tendency of human nature is to extend the qualification more and more, until at last private property disappears. But that cannot be accomplished in this way under the Constitution of the United States.\nThe general rule, at least, is that, while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far, it will be recognized as a taking. It may be doubted how far exceptional cases, like the blowing up of a house to stop a conflagration, go \u0026ndash; and, if they go beyond the general rule, whether they do not stand as much upon tradition as upon principle. Bowditch v. Boston, 101 U. S. 16. In general, it is not plain that a man\u0026rsquo;s misfortunes or necessities will justify his shifting the damages to his neighbor\u0026rsquo;s shoulders. Spade v. Lynn \u0026amp; Boston R.R. Co., 172 Mass. 488, 489. We are in danger of forgetting that a strong public desire to improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change. As we already have said, this is a question of degree \u0026ndash; and therefore cannot be disposed of by general propositions. But we regard this as going beyond any of the cases decided by this Court. The late decisions upon laws dealing with the congestion of Washington and New York, caused by the war, dealt with laws intended to meet a temporary emergency and providing for compensation determined to be reasonable by an impartial board. They were to the verge of the law, but fell far short of the present act. Block v. Hirsh, 256 U. S. 135; Marcus Brown Holding Co. v. Feldman, 256 U. S. 170; Levy Leasing Co. v. Siegel, 258 U. S. 242.\nWe assume, of course, that the statute was passed upon the conviction that an exigency existed that would warrant it, and we assume that an exigency exists that would warrant the exercise of eminent domain. But the question at bottom is upon whom the loss of the changes desired should fall. So far as private persons or communities have seen fit to take the risk of acquiring only surface rights, we cannot see that the fact that their risk has become a danger warrants the giving to them greater rights than they bought.\nDecree reversed.\nBrandeis J. (dissenting) — # The Kohler Act prohibits, under certain conditions, the mining of anthracite coal within the limits of a city in such a manner or to such an extent\n\u0026ldquo;as to cause the . . .subsidence of . . . any dwelling or other structure used as a human habitation, or any factory, store, or other industrial or mercantile establishment in which human labor is employed.\u0026rdquo;\nCoal in place is land, and the right of the owner to use his land is not absolute. He may not so use it as to create a public nuisance, and uses, once harmless, may, owing to changed conditions, seriously threaten the public welfare. Whenever they do, the legislature has power to prohibit such uses without paying compensation, and the power to prohibit extends alike to the manner, the character, and the purpose of the use. Are we justified in declaring that the Legislature of Pennsylvania has, in restricting the right to mine anthracite, exercised this power so arbitrarily as to violate the Fourteenth Amendment?\nEvery restriction upon the use of property imposed in the exercise of the police power deprives the owner of some right theretofore enjoyed, and is, in that sense, an abridgement by the state of rights in property without making compensation. But restriction imposed to protect the public health, safety or morals from dangers threatened is not a taking. The restriction here in question is merely the prohibition of a noxious use. The property so restricted remains in the possession of its owner. The state does not appropriate it or make any use of it. The state merely prevents the owner from making a use which interferes with paramount rights of the public. Whenever the use prohibited ceases to be noxious \u0026ndash; as it may because of further change in local or social conditions \u0026ndash; the restriction will have to be removed and the owner will again be free to enjoy his property as heretofore.\nThe restriction upon the use of this property cannot, of course, be lawfully imposed unless its purpose is to protect the public. But the purpose of a restriction does not cease to be public because, incidentally, some private persons may thereby receive gratuitously valuable special benefits. Thus, owners of low buildings may obtain, through statutory restrictions upon the height of neighboring structures, benefits equivalent to an easement of light and air. Welch v. Swasey, 214 U. S. 91. Compare Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., 220 U. S. 61; Walls v. Midland Carbon Co., 254 U. S. 300. Furthermore, a restriction, though imposed for a public purpose, will not be lawful unless the restriction is an appropriate means to the public end. But to keep coal in place is surely an appropriate means of preventing subsidence of the surface; and ordinarily it is the only available means. Restriction upon use does not become inappropriate as a means merely because it deprives the owner of the only use to which the property can then be profitably put. The liquor and the oleomargine cases settled that. Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, 123 U. S. 668-669; Powell v. Pennsylvania, 127 U. S. 678, 127 U. S. 682. See also Hadacheck v. Los Angeles, 239 U. S. 394; Pierce Oil Corporation v. City of Hope, 248 U. S. 498. Nor is a restriction imposed through exercise of the police power inappropriate as a means, merely because the same end might be effected through exercise of the power of eminent domain, or otherwise at public expense. Every restriction upon the height of buildings might be secured through acquiring by eminent domain the right of each owner to build above the limiting height; but it is settled that the state need not resort to that power. Compare Laurel Hill Cemetery v. San Francisco, 216 U. S. 358; Missouri Pacific Railway Co. v. Omaha, 235 U. S. 121. If, by mining anthracite coal, the owner would necessarily unloose poisonous gases, I suppose no one would doubt the power of the state to prevent the mining, without buying his coal fields. And why may not the state, likewise without paying compensation, prohibit one from digging so deep or excavating so near the surface, as to expose the community to like dangers? In the latter case, as in the former, carrying on the business would be a public nuisance.\nIt is said that one fact for consideration in determining whether the limits of the police power have been exceeded is the extent of the resulting diminution in value, and that here the restriction destroys existing rights of property and contract. But values are relative. If we are to consider the value of the coal kept in place by the restriction, we should compare it with the value of all other parts of the land. That is, with the value not of the coal alone, but with the value of the whole property. The rights of an owner as against the public are not increased by dividing the interests in his property into surface and subsoil. The sum of the rights in the parts can not be greater than the rights in the whole. The estate of an owner in land is grandiloquently described as extending ab orco usque ad coelum. But I suppose no one would contend that, by selling his interest above 100 feet from the surface, he could prevent the state from limiting, by the police power, the height of structures in a city. And why should a sale of underground rights bar the state\u0026rsquo;s power? For aught that appears, the value of the coal kept in place by the restriction may be negligible as compared with the value of the whole property, or even as compared with that part of it which is represented by the coal remaining in place and which may be extracted despite the statute. Ordinarily a police regulation, general in operation, will not be held void as to a particular property, although proof is offered that, owing to conditions peculiar to it, the restriction could not reasonably be applied. See Powell v. Pennsylvania; Murphy v. California. But even if the particular facts are to govern, the statute should, in my opinion be upheld in this case. For the defendant has failed to adduce any evidence from which it appears that to restrict its mining operations was an unreasonable exercise of the police power. Compare Reinman v. Little Rock; Pierce Oil Corporation v. City of Hope. Where the surface and the coal belong to the same person, self-interest would ordinarily prevent mining to such an extent as to cause a subsidence. It was, doubtless, for this reason that the legislature, estimating the degrees of danger, deemed statutory restriction unnecessary for the public safety under such conditions.\nIt is said that this is a case of a single dwelling house, that the restriction upon mining abolishes a valuable estate hitherto secured by a contract with the plaintiffs, and that the restriction upon mining cannot be justified as a protection of personal safety, since that could be provided for by notice. The propriety of deferring a good deal to tribunals on the spot has been repeatedly recognized. Welch v. Swasey; Laurel Hill Cemetery v. San Francisco; Patsone v. Pennsylvania. May we say that notice would afford adequate protection of the public safety where the legislature and the highest court of the State, with greater knowledge of local conditions, have declared, in effect, that it would not? If the public safety is imperilled, surely neither grant nor contract can prevail against the exercise of the police power. Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park; Atlantic Coast Line R.R. Co. v. North Carolina; Union Dry Goods Co. v. Georgia Public Service Corporation; St. Louis Poster Advertising Co. v. St. Louis. The rule that the state\u0026rsquo;s power to take appropriate measures to guard the safety of all who may be within its jurisdiction may not be bargained away was applied to compel carriers to establish grade crossings at their own expense, despite contracts to the contrary; Chicago, Burlington \u0026amp; Quincy R.R. Co. v. Nebraska;and, likewise, to supersede, by an Employers\u0026rsquo; Liability Act, the provision of a charter exempting a railroad from liability for death of employees, since the civil liability was deemed a matter of public concern, and not a mere private right. Texas \u0026amp; New Orleans R.R. Co. v. Miller. Compare Boyd v. Alabama; Stone v. Mississippi; Butchers\u0026rsquo; Union Co. v. Crescent City Co.; Douglas v. Kentucky; Pennsylvania Hospital v. Philadelphia. Nor can existing contracts between private individuals preclude exercise of the police power. \u0026ldquo;One whose rights, such as they are, are subject to state restriction cannot remove them from the power of the state by making a contract about them.\u0026rdquo; Hudson Water Co. v. McCarter; Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville; Rast v. Van Deman \u0026amp; Lewis Co.. The fact that this suit is brought by a private person is, of course, immaterial. To protect the community through invoking the aid, as litigant, of interested private citizens is not a novelty in our law. That it may be done in Pennsylvania was decided by its Supreme Court in this case. And it is for a state to say how its public policy shall be enforced.\nThis case involves only mining which causes subsidence of a dwelling house. But the Kohler Act contains provisions in addition to that quoted above; and as to these also, an opinion is expressed. These provisions deal with mining under cities to such an extent as to cause subsidence of\n\u0026ldquo;(a) Any public building or any structure customarily used by the public as a place of resort, assemblage, or amusement, including, but not limited to, churches, schools, hospitals, theaters, hotels, and railroad stations.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;(b) Any street, road, bridge, or other public passageway, dedicated to public use or habitually used by the public.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;(c) Any track, roadbed, right of way, pipe, conduit, wire, or other facility, used in the service of the public by any municipal corporation or public service company as defined by the Public Service Law.\u0026rdquo;\nA prohibition of mining which causes subsidence of such structures and facilities is obviously enacted for a public purpose, and it seems likewise clear that mere notice of intention to mine would not in this connection secure the public safety. Yet it is said that these provisions of the act cannot be sustained as an exercise of the police power where the right to mine such coal has been reserved. The conclusion seems to rest upon the assumption that, in order to justify such exercise of the police power, there must be \u0026ldquo;an average reciprocity of advantage\u0026rdquo; as between the owner of the property restricted and the rest of the community, and that here such reciprocity is absent. Reciprocity of advantage is an important consideration, and may even be an essential, where the state\u0026rsquo;s power is exercised for the purpose of conferring benefits upon the property of a neighborhood, as in drainage projects, Wurts v. Hoagland; Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley; or upon adjoining owners, as by party wall provisions, Jackman v. Rosenbaum Co., ante. But where the police power is exercised not to confer benefits upon property owners but to protect the public from detriment and danger, there is, in my opinion, no room for considering reciprocity of advantage. There was no reciprocal advantage to the owner prohibited from using his oil tanks in 248 U. S. 248 U.S. 498; his brickyard, in 239 U. S. 239 U.S. 394; his livery stable, in 237 U. S. 237 U.S. 171; his billiard hall, in 225 U. S. 225 U.S. 623; his oleomargarine factory, in 127 U. S. 127 U.S. 678; his brewery, in 123 U. S. 123 U.S. 623; unless it be the advantage of living and doing business in a civilized community. That reciprocal advantage is given by the act to the coal operators.\n"},{"id":146,"href":"/casebook/governance/perry/","title":"Perry v Clissold","section":"Chapter 2","content":"PRIVY COUNCIL\nPerry Appellant; and Clissold and Others Respondents.\nOn appeal from the High Court of Australia.\n14 December 1906\nThe Lord Chancellor, The Earl of Halsbury, Lord Macnaghten, Lord Davey, Lord Robertson, Lord Atkinson, Sir Ford North, Sir Arthur Wilson.\nThe judgment of their Lordships was delivered by\nLord Macnaghten – # This was an appeal from a judgment of the High Court of Australia, dated the 20th of June 1904, reversing a judgment of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. It raised a question under the Lands for Public Purposes Acquisition Act 1880 (44 Vict. No. 16), now superseded by the Public Works Act 1900, which consolidates the law on the subject.\nThe Act of 1880 in its preamble recites that it is expedient to make provision for the acquisition on behalf of the Crown of lands required for certain purposes, including among others \u0026ldquo;sites for public schools,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;to provide compensation for lands so acquired.\u0026rdquo;\nThe following are the material provisions of the Act.\nWhen the Governor sanctions the acquisition of any land for a school site he may, by notification in the Gazette, declare that such land, if private property, has been resumed for such purposes (sec. 6).\nUpon such publication the land is forthwith vested in the Minister of Public Instruction and his successors on behalf of the Crown, for the purposes of the Act, for an estate of inheritance in fee simple in possession freed and discharged from all other estates and interests (sec. 8).\nThe owners of the land or the persons who, but for the provisions thereinbefore contained would have been such owners are entitled to receive such sum of money by way of compensation for the land of which they have been deprived under the Act as may be agreed upon or otherwise ascertained under the provisions thereinafter contained (sec. 10).\nThe estate and interest of every person entitled to land so resumed, or any portion thereof, and whether to the legal or equitable estate therein, is by virtue of the Act deemed to have been as fully and effectually conveyed to the Minister as if the same had been conveyed by means of the most perfect assurances in the law. Every such estate and interest upon the publication of such notification as aforesaid is taken to have been converted into a claim for compensation in pursuance of the provisions thereinafter contained, and every person upon asserting his claim as thereinafter provided, and making out his title in respect of any portion of the resumed land, is entitled to compensation on account of such resumption in manner thereinafter provided (sec. 11).\nEvery person claiming compensation in respect of any land so resumed is, within ninety days from the publication of such notification or at any time afterwards, within such time as a Judge of the Supreme Court appoints in that behalf, to serve a notice in writing upon the Minister and a like notice upon the Crown Solicitor, \u0026ldquo;which notice,\u0026rdquo; it is declared, \u0026ldquo;shall set forth the nature of the estate or interest of the claimant in such land together with an abstract of his title\u0026rdquo; (sec. 12).\nSec. 13 is in the following terms:—\n\u0026ldquo;Within sixty days after the receipt of every such notice of claim by the Crown Solicitor he shall forward the same together with his report thereon to the Minister, who shall thereupon (unless no primâ facie case for compensation shall have been disclosed) cause a valuation of the land or of the estate or interest of the claimant therein to be made in accordance with the provisions of this Act and shall inform the claimant as soon as practicable of the amount of such valuation by notice in the form of the Second Schedule hereto.\u0026rdquo;\nBy notification published in the Gazette of 17th July 1891 a piece of land containing two acres and three perches at Canterbury in the County of Cumberland, was resumed for a public school site. The land was at the time in the possession of one Frederick Clissold. Notice of the resumption was given to Clissold on the 22nd of July 1891; but nothing further was done then. Clissold died shortly afterwards, and his will was proved on the 5th May 1892.\nIn May 1902 under an order of the Supreme Court the respondents, who are the present trustees of Clissold\u0026rsquo;s will and of whom three are his surviving executors, served notice of their claim to compensation in respect of the land resumed by the the notification of the 17th July 1891, stating that the claimants were the executors of Frederick Clissold, who at the date of the resumption was in possession of such land as the owner thereof, and in receipt of the rents of such lands, and had a title thereto by possession.\nIt appeared from the papers which were forwarded with the claim that in the year 1881 Frederick Clissold entered into possession of the land, which was then open and vacant, and enclosed it by substantial fencing, and that ever since the enclosure, up to the time of resumption, Clissold held exclusive possession of the land without notice of any adverse claim, and let it to different tenants and received the rents for his own use and benefit, and duly paid all rates and taxes in respect of the land which stood in his name in the rate-books of the municipality of Canterbury.\nThe Minister refused to entertain the claim to compensation.\nThe Supreme Court upheld the view of the Minister. The High Court reversed this decision and granted a mandamus requiring the Minister to cause a valuation to be made.\nThe only question on this appeal was, whether or not a prima facie case for compensation had been disclosed.\nOn the part of the Minister it was contended that, upon the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s own showing. Clissold was a mere trespasser, without any estate or interest in the land.\nTheir Lordships are unable to agree with this contention.\nIt cannot be disputed that a person in possession of land in the assumed character of owner and exercising peaceably the ordinary rights of ownership has a perfectly good title against all the world but the rightful owner. And if the rightful owner does not come forward and assert his title by process of law within the period prescribed by the provisions of the Statute of Limitations applicable to the case, his right is for ever extinguished, and the possessory owner acquires an absolute title.\nOn behalf of the Minister reliance was placed on the case of Doc v. Barnard1, which seems to lay down this proposition, that if a person having only a possessory title to land be supplanted in the possession by another who has himself no better title, and afterwards brings an action to recover the land, he must fail in case he shows in the course of the proceedings that the title on which he seeks to recover was merely possessory. It is however difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile this case with the later case of Asher v. Whitlock2, in which Doe v. Barnard3 was cited. The judgment of Cockburn C.J. is clear on that point. The rest of the Court concurred, and it may be observed that one of the members of the Court in Asher v. Whitlock4, (Lush J.) had been of counsel for the successful party in Doe v. Barnard.5 The conclusion at which the Court arrived in Doe v. Barnard6 is hardly consistent with the views of such eminent authorities on real property law as Mr. Preston and Mr. Joshua Williams. It is opposed to the opinions of modern text writers of such weight and authority as Professor Maitland and Holmes J., of the Supreme Court of the United States.7\nTheir Lordships are of opinion that it is impossible to say that no prima facie case for compensation has been disclosed.\nThey do not think that a case for compensation is necessarily excluded by the circumstance that under the provisions of the Act of 1900 the Minister acquired not merely the title of the person in possession as owner, but also the title, whatever it may have been, of the rightful owner out of possession who never came forward to claim the land or the compensation payable in respect of it, and who is, as the Chief Justice says, \u0026ldquo;unknown to this day.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Act throughout from the very preamble has it apparently in contemplation that compensation would be payable to every person deprived of the land resumed for public purposes. It could hardly have been intended or contemplated that the Act should have the effect of shaking titles which but for the Act would have been secure, and would in process of time have become absolute and indisputable, or that the Governor, or responsible Ministers acting under his instructions, should take advantage of the infirmity of anybody\u0026rsquo;s titles in order to acquire his land for nothing. Even where the true owner after diligent inquiry cannot be found, the Act contemplates payment of the compensation into Court to be dealt with by a Court of Equity.\nIt only remains for their Lordships to express their opinion that the valuation to be made should be a valuation of the land as at the date of the notification of the resumption.\nWhen the valuation is made it will be for the claimants to take such proceedings as they may be advised to recover the amount, unless the Minister thinks fit to pay them or to pay the money into Court.\nFor these reasons their Lordships humbly advised His Majesty that the appeal should be dismissed, and ordered the appellant to pay the costs of the appeal.\n13 Q.B., 945.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nL.R. 1 Q.B., 1.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n13 Q.B., 945.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nL.R. 1 Q.B., 1.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n13 Q.B., 945.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n13 Q.B., 945.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSee three articles by Professor Maitland in the Law Quarterly, vols. i., ii., and iv.; Holmes, Common Law, p. 244.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":147,"href":"/casebook/relationships/piper/","title":"Piper v Stevenson","section":"Chapter 1","content":" Clute J. — # The plaintiff claims as owner and occupier of lots 28 and 29, block \u0026ldquo;A,\u0026rdquo; Marmot street, North Toronto, registered plan No. 722, and asks an injunction restraining the defendant from trespass and for damages for former trespass and forcible entry. The defendant denies that the plaintiff is the owner of the lots in question, and says that he purchased the same from the registered owner thereof, and thereupon entered into possession of the same and built a fence thereon and planted a crop, which are the trespasses complained of.\nIn March, 1901, the plaintiff bargained for the adjoining lots with one Whaley, and in May or June delivered to Whaley a buggy in part payment. In September the plaintiff enclosed the Whaley lots and the lots in question by a fence, but did not receive the deeds of the Whaley lots until the 4th February, 1902, when three of them were conveyed to the plaintiff, and the 4th July, when the remaining three were conveyed to the plaintiff. In the fall, probably in October, after the fencing took place, the plaintiff had manure drawn upon the lands in question; and the evidence shews that they have been cultivated and cropped by the plaintiff ever since.\nThe plaintiff did not reside upon the land in question, nor upon the lots purchased from Whaley, until 1905 or 1906, but lived at a short distance therefrom, upon a rented farm, from which she could walk to the lots in about fifteen minutes, or drive in five minutes. The Whaley lots, and the lots in question, formed a block, and were wholly enclosed from September, 1901, until action brought on the 21st June, 1912.\nThe learned trial Judge finds that the lands in question \u0026ldquo;were fenced in with her own as one lot\u0026rdquo; in September, \u0026ldquo;and all the lots thus enclosed were together ploughed as one lot, and during the following winter manure was drawn out and placed upon the land. Everything was done to it that an owner intending to possess and cultivate it would have done. In the following spring it was cropped, and from that time on it was cultivated until the crop was taken, off, when fall ploughing and manuring were again done. And this has gone on continuously ever since. In the years 1905 and 1906, buildings were erected, and in the latter year the plaintiff went to live and has ever since lived there. Her possession has been all along open, obvious, exclusive, and continuous. Until 1906, everything was done upon the land that an owner could do in reaping the full benefit of it ; and, since the spring of that year, everything that an owner in actual, constant occupation would do. All this is well proved by the witnesses Doughty, Whaley, and Newman as well as by the plaintiff and her husband.\u0026rdquo;\nI think that this is a fair statement as a result of the evidence. The learned trial Judge then proceeds: \u0026ldquo;I cannot think that the logical result of the reasoning in any of the decided cases can be that there can be no possession which would ripen into a right to the land unless the possessor also lives upon it; and, if it were, I would be quite unable to follow it to that extent in this case. Here there was the plainest evidence of wrongful possession, in the fencing in of the land in question as part and parcel of the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s land alone, calling for action on the owner\u0026rsquo;s part if he desired to save his rights—action in removing the fences or in the Courts of justice; and, in addition to that, there was the continuous use by the plaintiff for her own benefit, for upwards of ten years before any such action was taken; and so the rights of the owner became barred by statute.\u0026rdquo;\nMr. Armour strongly urged that what was done by or on behalf of the plaintiff in respect of fencing and occupation of the lots did not bring the case within the purview of the statute so as to give her a title, because the work was done by her servant, and she did not personally reside upon the land until some five or six years after the property was fenced. He further urged that the deeds to the plaintiff of the adjoining lots not having been given until February, 1902, the possession of the adjoining lots was in the owner of them, and the lot in question could not be considered as enclosed with the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s until she received the deed; and that the entry by the defendant after he had received his deed, he then having the paper title, vested the property in him, the statute not having run a sufficient length of time from the date of the deed of the adjoining lots to the plaintiff and the entry by the defendant.\nThe plain answer to that, I think, is this: it is wholly immaterial whether the plaintiff had received a deed of the adjoining lots or not; she had bargained for them, and fenced them in, in September, 1901; and her possession of them and of the land in question was continuous and exclusive from the date of fencing.\nAs to the entry, such as it was, under the law as it now stands, it could have no effect. Since the Act, sec. 8, no person shall be deemed to have been in possession of any land within the meaning of the Act merely by reason of having made an entry thereon. \u0026ldquo;Under the old law a merely formal entry by the person entitled was sufficient to vest the possession in him: Co. Litt. 253b; though under 4 \u0026amp; 5 Anne ch. 16, sec. 16, such an entry or claim was not effectual to avoid the statute 21 Jac. I. ch. 16, unless an action was commenced within a year and prosecuted with effect\u0026hellip;The result is that an entry, to vest the possession in the person entering and prevent the bar of the statute, must be effective as opposed to merely formal. The making an entry amounts to nothing unless something is done to divest the possession out of the tenant, and revest it in fact in the lord: Doe v. Coombes (1860), 9 , C.B. 714, at p. 718. And it must be made animo possidendi: Soiling v. Broughton, [18 , 63] A.C. 556.\u0026rdquo; In the Coombes case, after the encroachment, the lord of the manor, accompanied by the steward, entered. The lord stated that he took possession, and directed that a stone should be taken out of the wall of the hut, and that a portion of the fence should be removed. This was held no more than a mere entry, and not sufficient to vest the possession in the lord. See Lightwood\u0026rsquo;s Time Limit on Actions, pp. 11, 12.\nIt is said in Worssam v. Vandenbrande (1868), 17 W.R. 53, that slighter acts will be sufficient if no person is actually on the land at the time of re-entry, although the possession may not be vacant. In that case the predecessors in title went to the land, broke down the fence, and erected a post with the announcement that applications for a lease of the land were to be made to them. They remained on the land three-quarters of an hour. Three days later, the post was gone, but there was no evidence to shew who had removed it. For the next five years no one, so far as appeared, did anything on the land, and then the defendant re-entered and built upon it. It was held that the plaintiffs\u0026rsquo; predecessors had effectually resumed possession.\nThe present case differs from that quoted in several particulars. The land has been continuously used and occupied down to the present time by the plaintiff. The plaintiff was in fact residing upon the land at the time the alleged entry was made, that is, upon the block of which the lands in question form a part, being one enclosure for the whole. Also here the ten years had elapsed after the enclosure and before the entry; and the entry was such as, I think, expressly falls within sec. 8 of the Act.\nThere remains, therefore, for consideration, only the question as to whether or not a piece of land entirely enclosed with other lands by the plaintiff, used and occupied by her continuously for over ten years, her possession all along being \u0026ldquo;open, obvious, exclusive, and continuous,\u0026rdquo; does not come within the statute, simply because in the earlier four or five years she did not live upon the land; that is, was personally absent during the winter, although the land remained still enclosed by the fence and was used and occupied as an owner would use and occupy in such a case.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIt is impossible, I think, to treat what took place in the present case as abandonment. The land was entirely enclosed. It was cultivated and cropped every year. It is begging the question to say that, because the land was not used in the winter time, when it could not be used for any useful purpose, therefore there was an abandonment. Surely abandonment is a matter of intention, and the cultivating and cropping from year to year shews that there never was any intention of abandonment; and the case cited with respect to that point had, I think, no application.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut, where the property is entirely enclosed by the person claiming by possession, his mere absence does not, in my opinion, amount to abandonment or make the premises vacant. It may still be considered under his control, inasmuch as it excludes all others therefrom by his enclosure. If the owner himself claimed before the statute had barred him, he could not reach his land without doing some act. He could not make an entry without at least breaking down, if not destroying, the fence. It is a notice to all the world that the property is claimed by some one and that all others are excluded, and unless there is some act on the part of the true owner to create a new starting-point, and the intruder retains possession by the enclosure, and uses and cultivates the land as his own, either by himself or his servants, although not actually present, in person or by his servants, during portions of the year, the owner is excluded and his title barred after the statutory period.\nAside from the authorities, it seems to me plain that in the present case the owner\u0026rsquo;s right of action first accrued when the lands in question were enclosed, thereby excluding him. \u0026ldquo;No person shall make an entry or distress, or bring any action to recover any land or rent, but within ten years next after the time at which the right to make such entry or distress, or to bring such action, first accrued to some person through whom he claims\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; sec. 4 of the Real Property Limitation Act, R.S.O. 1897, ch. 133. \u0026ldquo;Where the person claiming such land or rent, or some person, through whom he, claims, has, in respect of the estate or interest claimed, been in possession\u0026hellip;and has\u0026hellip;been dispossessed\u0026hellip;then such right shall be deemed to have first accrued at the time of such dispossession or discontinuance of possession\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; ib., sec. 5, clause 1.\nIt seems to me impossible to say, without disregarding the fair meaning of the word, that an owner of land is not dispossessed when another has enclosed his property without leave or colour of right and uses it as his own. By sec. 15, at the end of the period of limitation the right of the party out of possession is extinguished. Here I cannot doubt upon the facts, as found by the trial Judge, fully supported by the evidence, that, during the period required by the statute, the true owner was excluded from possession by the act of the plaintiff, who never abandoned the premises, but, on the contrary, \u0026ldquo;her possession has been all along, open, obvious, exclusive, and continuous. Until 1906, everything was done upon the land that an owner not residing upon it would do in reaping the full benefit of it, and since the spring of that year everything that an owner in actual, constant occupation would do.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is sufficient under the Act, in my judgment, to exclude any right or title of the former owner.\nAs pointed out in Halsbury\u0026rsquo;s Laws of England, vol. 19, p. 110, sec. 203: \u0026ldquo;The true test whether a rightful owner has been dispossessed or not is whether ejectment will lie at his suit against some other person. The rightful owner is not dispossessed, so long as he has all the enjoyment of the property that is possible; and where land is not capable of use and enjoyment, there can be no dispossession by mere absence of use and enjoyment. To constitute dispossession acts must have been done inconsistent with the enjoyment of the soil by the person entitled for the purposes for which he had a right to use it. Mere going out of possession is not enough; in order that the statute may operate there must be not only going out of possession on the part of the former owner, but also actual exclusive possession for the statutory period by some one else to be protected. If a person enters on the land of another and, before he has acquired a title under the statute, abandons possession, no one else then taking possession, the rightful owner is in the same position as if no intrusion had taken place.\u0026rdquo;\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n"},{"id":148,"href":"/casebook/governance/planning-act/","title":"Planning Act","section":"Chapter 2","content":" Continuance of lawfully existing non-conformities\n86(1) Subject to sections 88 to 91, the enactment of a new zoning by-law does not affect any of the following that lawfully existed before the enactment of the new zoning by-law:\n(a) a building;\n(b) a parcel of land;\n(c) the use of land, or the intensity of a use of land.\n"},{"id":149,"href":"/problems/possession/","title":"Problems of Possession","section":"Problems","content":"In class this week, we will focus on two short problems:\nProblem 1: First Possession # Two children are playing on a beach and see an old abandoned boat washed up on shore.

As in your other courses, you will gain a solid understanding of legal rules \u0026ldquo;on the books\u0026rdquo; that address a range of issues (local, national and global) and you will see how those rules have changed and been adapted over time. But we will also address legal rules with a specific goal in mind\u0026ndash;one that goes beyond a basic proficiency in the common law or legislation. Our goal is to understand and develop a thoughtful answer to the following question:\nHow have legal rules about property created Canada\u0026rsquo;s liberal market economy over the past few hundred years, and who benefits from the result? In other words, we will take a social institution—the market economy—and try to develop a story about how law has realized one actual and particular version of that institution over time in the Canadian context.1 A \u0026ldquo;liberal\u0026rdquo; market economy is one based on certain political values like privacy and individual freedom. We will have much more to say about this concept of a liberal market economy and its relationship to property law in later classes.\nThe idea that Canada has one kind of market economy, with its specific distribution of benefits and burdens, is not predestined. Nor is it an accident. Legal rules—property foremost among them—are the product of societal choices that create background conditions for both market exchange and its regulation by the state.2 By taking a critical look at those choices we have a better chance of understanding our current economic conditions, as well as their potential for change.\nThe problem is that, too often, we take these legal rules that structure the market for granted, and we accept that the resulting benefits and burdens are the natural consequences of market competition. Legal rules are seen mainly as interventions by government in free exchanges between individuals, with the goal of mitigating the market\u0026rsquo;s adverse or unequal effects. But this perspective overlooks the expansive infrastructure of legal rules in property and other areas that make such exchanges possible in the first place.\nWe can start to address this problem of perspective\u0026ndash;and thereby engage the question of how property rules underpin Canada\u0026rsquo;s liberal market economy\u0026ndash;by focusing on three key assumptions about law and economic markets that we often make in debates and discussions about social and economic policy. After you review these three assumptions below, the exercise that follows asks you to identify them in a real-world example.\nBritton-Purdy, Jedediah, David Singh Grewal, Amy Kapczynski, and K Sabeel Rahman. “Building a Law-and-Political-Economy Framework: Beyond the Twentieth-Century Synthesis.” The Yale Law Journal 129 (2020): 1784, 1819.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nDesautels-Stein, Justin. \u0026ldquo;The Market as a Legal Concept.\u0026rdquo; Buffalo Law Review 60 (2012): 387, 391\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":152,"href":"/casebook/governance/protection-property/","title":"Protection of Property Act","section":"Chapter 2","content":" 2 In this Act,\n[\u0026hellip;]\n(b) \u0026ldquo;occupier\u0026rdquo; includes\n(i) a person who is in possession of premises, or\n(ii) a person who has responsibility for and control over the condition of premises or the activities there carried on, or control over persons allowed to enter the premises,\n[\u0026hellip;]\n(d) \u0026ldquo;premises\u0026rdquo; means lands and structures, or either of them, and includes trailers and portable structures designed or used for residence, business or shelter.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n4 Every person who, without legal justification, whether conferred by an enactment or otherwise, remains on premises after being directed to leave by the occupier of the premises or a person authorized by the occupier is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of not more than five hundred dollars.\n"},{"id":153,"href":"/problems/squatters/","title":"Public Perceptions of Squatters","section":"Problems","content":"Read this HuffPost new article on \u0026ldquo;squatters\u0026rsquo; rights\u0026rdquo; and the housing crisis in Detroit.

(dissenting) \u0026ndash; # On 15th February 1951 the respondents purchased the lands known as Oakwood Stadium and on 19th May 1951, they began to promote and conduct in the stadium stock car races.\nOakwood Stadium consists of an oval open space upon which there is sitting accommodation partly in open stands and partly in a covered stand. This stadium at the time of the passing of the by-law in 1948 and prior to the occupation of the respondents in February 1951 was suitable for permitting members of the public to witness various kinds of sport contests including the playing of soccer, rugby and track and field events. Prior to February 1951 there was a cinder track 18 feet wide around the perimeter of the playing field suitable for foot-races.\nOn 19th May 1951 the exhibition or contest of stock car races was held. This contest consists of a number of races of a designated number of laps in which six or eight cars take part. The playing-field area of the stadium is used as a repair pit for the cars involved and as a place to store them when they are not actually engaged in a race. A race commences when six or eight cars are lined up two abreast on the track. They complete one or two circles of the track at a slow speed and then the starter\u0026rsquo;s flag commences the race. The cars endeavour to complete the designated number of laps in the shortest possible time, passing each other from time to time.\nThe cars used are motor cars manufactured prior to 1939 and modified by their owners to increase the power, reduce the weight and increase the strength of the top, so that accidents are less likely to injure the occupants.\nDuring the progress of the race the cars give off very loud noises from their exhaust and from the screeching of wheels and the clanging and banging when the cars collide with each other. There are also extensive fumes from the exhaust.\nShortly after the occupation of the premises by the respondents began in February 1951 substantial changes were made in the Oakwood Stadium at a cost of from $5,000 to $9,000. The major changes made were as follows:\n(a) The track was increased in width from 18 feet to 40 feet.\n(b) The four lower rows of seats were removed from the bleachers and a safety-rail consisting of a fence, the posts of which were in the form of concrete-filled boilers. was substituted.\n(c) The cinder track was covered with sand and gravel and oiled. The ends of the track were banked to provide an inclined turn and the banked portions were covered with asphalt.\nThe evidence of Mr. Crang, the former owner, is that prior to 1948 the stadium management had experimented with automobile and motorcycle racing as follows: (a) midget car racing, one week in 1932 and one week in 1934; (b) racing cars, two one-week meets about two years apart; (c) motorcycles, once and one race at a carnival. Also that the former owners had reached the conclusion prior to April 1948 that the premises were unsafe for the racing of cars, midget cars or motorcycles and this use had been abandoned for the reason that the premises would require an expenditure of money on them to make them safe for car, midget car or motorcycle races.\nSection 390 of The Municipal Act is in part as follows:\n(1) By-laws may be passed by the councils of local municipalities:\n1. For prohibiting the use of land, for or except for such purposes as may be set out in the by-law, within any defined area or areas or abutting on any defined highway or part of a highway\u0026hellip;.\n(6) No by-law passed under this section shall apply to any land, building or structure which, on the day of the passing of the by-law, is used or erected for any purpose prohibited by the by-law, so long as it continues to be used for that purpose, nor shall the by-law apply to any building or structure the plans for which have prior to the day of the passing of the by-law been approved by the municipal architect or building inspector, so long as the building or structure when erected is used for the purpose for which it was erected.\nThe learned County Court Judge in his reasons for judgment came to the conclusion that since at the time of the passing of the by-law the premises were used for a non-residential purpose, they could continue to be used for any non-residential purpose. In his opinion the effect of the qualifying clause \u0026ldquo;so long as it continues to be used for that purpose\u0026rdquo; is the same as \u0026ldquo;so long as it continues to be used for a non-residential purpose\u0026rdquo;. In other words, if the premises had been used as a store at the time of the passing of the by-law they could be used as a factory, since both are non-residential purposes.\nAlso in his reasons he finds that the use being made of the lands prior to the By-law and the use being made on the date of the conviction were \u0026ldquo;for a similar purpose\u0026rdquo;. He also finds that the changes made in the premises were substantial but \u0026ldquo;the character of the use of the buildings and lands were not substantially changed\u0026rdquo;.\nI am unable to agree with the conclusion of the learned County Court Judge or with his reasons therefor. In my opinion the change made in the character of the premises so as to adapt them for motor car racing is in direct conflict with the provisions of the by-law and of the statute under which it was passed.\nPrior to the date of the passing of the by-law the premises in question were not used and were not adapted or suitable for use for motor car racing and it required a substantial expenditure of money and complete reconstruction of the facilities so as to enable motor car racing to be carried on.\nIn presenting his appeal Mr. Mason properly referred to the facts only as they were presented by the respondents, and based his appeal purely upon the question of law.\nI am of opinion that the judgment of the learned County Court Judge should be reversed and that the convictions by the magistrate should be restored, and that the respondents should pay the costs of the appeal to His Honour Judge Factor, of the motion before Mr. Justice Roach for leave to appeal, and of this appeal.\nLaidlaw J.A. # The appeal to this Court is on a question of law alone but it is necessary first to set forth the material facts. A company named Oakwood Securities Limited was incorporated under the provisions of the Ontario Companies Act by letters patent dated the 31st October 1925. The purposes and objects of that company, stated briefly, are in part:\n(b) to carry on generally the business of furnishing amusement to the public; to carry on the business of operating a hippodrome, circus, racecourse, amusement park, theatre and exhibition and of presenting performances of all kinds, in all its branches and in particular to lay out and prepare any lands or emplacements for the running of horse, automobile, motorcycle, bicycle, aeroplane and all kinds of races \u0026hellip; to construct grand or other stands \u0026hellip; and other erections, buildings and conveniences whether of a permanent or temporary nature which may seem directly or indirectly conducive to the Company\u0026rsquo;s objects;\n(c) to conduct, hold and promote race meetings and athletic sports, matches of all kinds\u0026hellip;\nAfter incorporation the company proceeded to carry on its business on the lands and premises known and referred to as the Oakwood Stadium situate in the township of York. It used the stadium for motorcycle races, midget car races, automobile races, dog races, rodeo carnivals and, according to the secretary-treasurer, \u0026ldquo;tried nearly everything we thought would draw the public\u0026rdquo;. There was a quarter-mile race-track about 18 feet in width surrounding a playing field. The track was suitable for foot-races but unsafe for motorcycle, stock car or midget car races. The company was not willing to spend the money to make the track safe for races of that kind and partly for that reason gave up having them but continued to carry on its activities of other kinds on the property until it was sold by the company to the respondents in 1951.\nPursuant to the powers contained in what is now s. 390 of The Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1950, c. 243, the council of the Township of York passed By-law 13249 dated the 5th April 1948, which was approved by an order of the Ontario Municipal Board on the 27th April 1948. I reproduce that by-law, in part, as follows:\nA BYLAW\nNo. 13249\nTO ESTABLISH a Restricted District or Zone within a defined area of the Township of York (Glenhurst Avenue).\nTHE MUNICIPAL COUNCIL OF THE CORPORATION OF THE TOWNSHIP OF YORK ENACTS AS FOLLOWS:\n(1)\nTHAT no person shall use any land or erect or use any building for any other purpose than that of a detached or semi-detached private residence, duplex, triplex, double duplex or Apartment House with suitable out buildings therefor within that area of the Township of York defined as follows: \u0026hellip;\n(3)\nTHAT this by-law shall not apply to any land or buildings which on the day the said By-law is passed is erected or used for any purpose prohibited by this By-law so long as it continues to be used for that purpose. Nor shall it apply to any buildings, the plans of which have been approved by the Municipal Building Inspector prior to the date of the passing of the By-law so long as when erected it is used for the purpose for which it was erected\u0026hellip;.\nENACTED AND PASSED THIS 5TH DAY OF APRIL 1948.\nOn 15th February 1951 the respondents purchased the property and commenced to use it for soccer, football matches, boxing matches, baseball games, \u0026ldquo;track-meets\u0026rdquo; and for \u0026ldquo;stock car races\u0026rdquo;. A stock car is described as \u0026ldquo;a car you might buy on a lot or drive on the street \u0026hellip; to differentiate from special racing cars\u0026rdquo;. Changes were made by the respondents to make the track suitable for stock car races. The width was increased from 18 feet to about 40 feet, the surface was treated, the corners were banked higher, safety rails were erected and a substantial sum of money was expended for the work.\nCounsel for the appellant maintains that the learned judge in the Court below ought to have held that the use of the property by the respondents for stock car racing was contrary to the provisions of By-law 13249. He argues that the use of the property for that purpose was abandoned, or at least discontinued, prior to the passing of the by-law and that in consequence clause 3 of the by-law is not applicable so as to afford the respondents a good answer to the charge against them. That clause corresponds with s. 390(6) of The Municipal Act and limits the scope of the by-law by express provision that it shall not apply to any land, building or structure of the character described therein. It will be observed that there are two classes of property covered by the subsection, namely, land and a building or structure. It will be observed also that there are two specifications set forth in the clause. Firstly, in the case of land it must be in use on the day of the passing of the by-law for a purpose prohibited by the by-law, and in the case of a building or structure it must be erected on that day for such a purpose. Secondly, the use of the land or of the building or structure for a purpose prohibited by the by-law must continue. Thus, if the use of either the land or a building or structure for a purpose prohibited by the by-law has commenced either before or after the day of the passing of the by-law and there after has been discontinued, the property thereupon ceases to meet the specifications contained in the clause and the by-law becomes applicable to it. In the present case both the land and structures comprised in Oakwood Stadium were used for the same purpose, and the use commenced many years before the by-law was passed. There can be no doubt that the use of the whole property was for a purpose prohibited by the by-law.\nThe cardinal question for consideration is whether or not the use for that purpose was discontinued before the day of the passing of the by-law. That question can be answered only after considering and determining what was the purpose for which the property was used. In my opinion that purpose was a general one. It comprehended the use of the stadium for public amusement and entertainment and for public exhibitions and performances of all kinds. The purpose must be regarded collectively as a whole and cannot properly be divided into parts. Thus it cannot be said the purpose for which the property was used on the day of the passing of the by-law was for football games or for foot-races or for any other particular kind of public entertainment, exhibition or performance. It was for one and all of that kind of activity. It follows that, in my opinion, the purpose for which the property was used at the time of the passing of the by-law did not change and the use of the property for that purpose did not cease merely because the users of it were unwilling at one time, prior to the passing of the by-law, to spend the money necessary to make part of the property suitable and safe for one particular kind of activity within the general class, and for that reason in part discontinued that particular kind of public entertainment or performance. Nor did the fact that at a later date the users of the property decided to spend the money and thereafter made the changes in the property necessary to make it suitable and safe for stock car races have the effect of changing the purpose for which the property was used. I think that the purpose for which the property was used at all times before and after the passing of the by-law was the general one as I have described it above, and that the use for that purpose was not at any time discontinued. Therefore, I hold that the by-law was not applicable to the land, building or structure known as Oakwood Stadium on the day of the alleged offence. Accordingly, the appeal should be dismissed.\n"},{"id":156,"href":"/casebook/relationships/syliboy/","title":"R v Syliboy","section":"Chapter 1","content":" Patterson (Acting) Co. Ct. J. — # The defendant, who is the grand chief of the Mick Macks of Nova Scotia was convicted under the Lands and Forests Act, 1926 (N.S.), c. 4, of having in his possession at Askilton in the County of Inverness on November 4, last fifteen green pelts, fourteen muskrat and one fox. He made no attempt to deny having the pelts, indeed frankly admits having them, but claims that as an Indian he is not bound by the provisions of the Act, but has by Treaty the right to hunt and trap at all times. Every now and then for a number of years one has heard that our Indians were making these claims but, so far as I know, the matter has never been before a Court.\nThe Treaty relied upon is that of 1752, made between Governor Hopson of the Province of Nova Scotia and His Majesty’s Council on behalf of His Majesty, and “Major’ Jean Baptiste Cope, chief Sachem of the Tribe of Mick Mack Indians Inhabiting the Eastern Coast of the said Province, and Andrew Hadley Martin, Gabriel Martin \u0026amp; Francis Jeremiah, Members and Delegates of the said Tribe:” (1 Nova Scotia Archives, p. 683). Article 4 in part says: — “It is agreed that the said Tribe of Indians shall not be hindered from but have free liberty to hunt and fish as usual.”\nObserve the date 1752. Cape Breton between 1748 and 1763 was not part of Nova Scotia. It was owned and governed by the French, while Nova Scotia was a colony of Great Britain. It will be remembered that defendant is a Cape Breton Indian and that the offence alleged against him was committed in Cape Breton. Assuming for the time that the Treaty is still in force in Nova Scotia proper, can defendant claim protection under it? Unless there is something more than I have stated, clearly not. But, say his counsel, the Mick Mack Tribe throughout Nova Scotia, including Cape Breton, is one and indivisible, and the Treaty was made with the tribe, and a very bright and intelligent young Indian testifies that two of the signatories to it were Cape Breton Indians. The language of the Treaty not only lends no support to this contention, but shows that it is untenable, and I am satisfied that the young Indian is mistaken.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn 1794 the first of our many Game Acts was passed, 1794 (N.S.), c. 4. It provided that no person within a certain period each year should kill partridge or black duck but Indians and poor settlers. It might be argued that the exception goes to show that the Indians had a special right by treaty, but if they had such a right why mention it in the statute? It would seem to me that the proper interpretation would be that they having no such right by treaty were given it by statute. However that may be the next statute on the subject makes the point clear.\nBy s. 1 of R.S.N.S. 1851, c. 92, it was enacted that: —\n”No person shall take or kill any partridge \u0026hellip; between the first of March and the first of September in any year; but Indians and poor settlers may kill them for their own use at any season.”\nSection 3 of that Act provides that: — “The sessions may make orders respecting the setting of snares or traps for catching moose,” and by s. 5, “may make orders for regulating the periods \u0026hellip; within which moose may be killed.” If the Indians were excepted as to the taking or killing of partridge because they had special right by treaty, why were they not so excepted as to setting snares or killing moose?\nThen follows a series of statutes prohibiting everyone, Indians not excepted, from hunting during certain seasons until we come to that under which this prosecution was brought. Where a statute and treaty conflict a British Court must follow the statute, (Re Carter Medicine Co.’s Trade-Mark, [1892] 3 Ch. 472; Walker v. Baird, [1892] A.C. 491, at pp. 494-5). The result therefore is that even assuming the so called Treaty of 1752 is a treaty; assuming that it was valid as such without ratification by parliament, and that any rights under it could be claimed by the Indians of all Nova Scotia as that Province is now constituted, the prosecution would still succeed, because the statute not the treaty prevails.\nAt the trial there was no discussion as to whether the so called treaty was really a treaty or not. Counsel for the defendant, whose closely reasoned brief I cannot too highly commend, did not touch this point. Apparently they are content to accept the description in the document itself, “Treaty or Articles of Peace,” but the prosecution raised the question and I must deal with it. Two considerations are involved. First, did the Indians of Nova Scotia have status to enter into a treaty? And second, did Governor Hopson have authority to enter into one with them? Both questions must I think be answered in the negative.\n(1) “Treaties are unconstrained Acts of independent powers.” But the Indians were never regarded as an independent power. A civilized nation first discovering a country of uncivilized people or savages held such country as its own until such time as by treaty it was transferred to some other civilized nation. The savages’ rights of sovereignty even of ownership were never recognized. Nova Scotia had passed to Great Britain not by gift or purchase from or even by conquest of the Indians but by treaty with France, which had acquired it by priority of discovery and ancient possession; and the Indians passed with it. Indeed the very fact that certain Indians sought from the Governor the privilege or right to hunt in Nova Scotia as usual shows that they did not claim to be an independent nation owning or possessing their lands. If they were, why go to another nation asking this privilege or right and giving promise of good behaviour that they might obtain it? In my judgment the Treaty of 1752 is not a treaty at all and is not to be treated as such; it is at best a mere agreement made by the Governor and council with a handful of Indians giving them in return for good behaviour food, presents, and the right to hunt and fish as usual — an agreement that, as we have seen, was very shortly after broken.\n(2) Did Governor Hopson have authority to make a treaty? I think not. “Treaties can be made only by the constituted authorities of nations or by persons specially deputed by them for that purpose.” Clearly our treaty was not made with the constituted authorities of Great Britain. But was Governor Hopson specially deputed by them? Cornwallis’ commission is the manual not only for himself but for his successors and you will search it in vain for any power to sign treaties.\nHaving called the agreement a treaty, and having perhaps lulled the Indians into believing it to be a treaty with all the sacredness of a treaty attached to it, it may be the Crown should not now be heard to say it is not a treaty. With that I have nothing to do. That is a matter for representations to the proper authorities — representations which if there is nothing else in the way of the Indians could hardly fail to be successful.\nOn behalf of the defendant one witness testified that all his life he had fished as he would without regard to the Fisheries Law, and defendant himself swears he has started hunting muskrat for the last thirty-four years on Hallowe’en, October 31.\nNeither of them had ever been interfered with. The suggestion was that they had not been interfered with because they were within their rights in doing what they did by virtue of the treaty. I say nothing about fishing, but as to the hunting it was not until 1927 that the close season was extended to November 15. Until that year whenever there had been a close season on muskrat it had ended on November 1. If defendant did not start his hunting until October 31, the reason he was not proceeded against before seems obvious.\nThere is abundant evidence also that the Indians have been for many years receiving food, blankets, etc., from the government through the Indian agent because, says the defendant, of this treaty. I cannot agree. Rather I think they received these goods, and other benefits as well, not because of the treaty but by virtue of the successive statutes in that behalf: (1842 (N.S.), c. 16; 1844 (N.S.), c. 56; R.S.N.S. 1851, c. 58; and 1859 (N.S.), c. 14). The good work so begun and carried on when Nova Scotia was a separate Province was taken over by the federal government at Confederation and one is glad to learn is being so generously continued.\nOn no ground that has been advanced, and I am sure everything has been said or done that with any chance of success could have been said or done, can defendant in my opinion succeed. Such sympathy as a Judge is permitted to have is with defendant. I would gladly allow the appeal if I could find any sound reason for doing so, but I cannot and must confirm the conviction. The very capable Magistrate who heard the case below has, I am pleased to see, fixed the penalty at the very lowest figure that the Act allows. Even so I venture to express the hope that the authorities will not enforce the conviction.\nI have no doubt whatever that defendant honestly believed that the treaty was valid and that he was entitled under it to kill muskrat or have their pelts in his possession at any time, and as I pointed out, a year ago or rather in 1926 it was no offence on November 4 to have green muskrat pelts in one’s possession. While everyone is presumed to know the law and to know the exact limits of the close season, it is more than likely — is it not a certainty — that the untutored mind of the defendant was not aware that in 1927 the close season had been lengthened to November 15? Of course, ignorance of the law excuses no one, but surely ignorance of the law under such circumstances can be urged as a plea for most lenient treatment — for in such a case as this waiving both penalty and costs.\n"},{"id":157,"href":"/casebook/governance/drummond/","title":"Re Drummond Wren","section":"Chapter 2","content":" Mackay J. — # This is an application brought by Drummond Wren, owner of certain lands registered in the Registry Office for the County of York, to have declared invalid a restrictive covenant assumed by him when he purchased these lands and which he agreed to exact from his assigns, namely, — “Land not to be sold to Jews or persons of objectionable nationality.”\nThe application is made by way of special leave and pursuant to s. 60 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 152, and Rules 603 and 604 of The Rules of Practice and Procedure.\nUnder s. 60(1) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, a wide discretion is given to a judge to modify or discharge any condition or covenant “Where there is annexed to any land any condition or covenant that such land or any specified portion thereof is not to be built on or is to be or not to be used in a particular manner, or any other condition or covenant running with or capable of being legally annexed to land.”\nRules 603 and 604 provide respectively that:\n603 (1) Where any person claims to be the owner of land, but does not desire to have his title thereto quieted under the Quieting Titles Act, he may have any particular question which would arise upon an application to have his title quieted determined upon an originating notice.\n(2) Notice shall be given to all persons to whom notice would be given under the Quieting Titles Act, and the Court shall have the same power finally to dispose of and determine such particular question as it would have under the said Act, but this shall not render it necessary to give the notice required by Rule 705.\n604 Where the rights of any person depend upon the construction of any deed, will or other instrument, he may apply by originating notice, upon notice to all persons concerned, to have his rights declared and determined.\nWhile, pursuant to an order made by me, notice of this application was served upon various persons interested in this and in adjacent lands subject to the same or a similar restrictive covenant, no one appeared in Court upon the return of this motion to oppose it.\nThe restrictive covenant which is the subject of this proceeding and which by the deed aforesaid the grantee assumes and agrees to exact from his assigns, reads as follows: “Land not to be sold to Jews, or to persons of objectionable nationality.” Counsel for the applicant seeks the discharge and removal of this covenant on these alternative grounds: first, that it is void as against public policy; secondly, that it is invalid as a restraint on alienation; thirdly, that it is void for uncertainty; and fourthly, that it contravenes the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, 1944 (Ont.), c. 51. The matter before me, so defined, appears to raise issues of first impression, because a search of the case law of Great Britain and of Canada does not reveal any reported decision which would be of direct assistance in this proceeding.\nCounsel for the applicant did refer me to three Ontario cases dealing with restrictive covenants similar to that here involved, but, in my view, he rightly took the position that in none of those cases was the Court called upon to pass on the validity of the particular restriction in the way in which I am obliged to do in this case. Garrow J. in Essex Real Estate Co. Ltd. v. Holmes, 37 O.W.N. 392, affirmed 38 O.W.N. 69, did not have to determine the validity of the restriction in that case because he found that the purchaser of the land was not within its terms. Again, in Re Bryers \u0026amp; Morris, 40 O.W.N. 572, which was a vendor’s and purchaser’s motion, Hodgins J.A. refrained from passing on the validity of the restrictive covenant there in question. The third case mentioned by counsel for the applicant is a recent decision of Chevrier J., Re McDougall and Waddell, [1945] O.W.N. 272, [1945] 2 D.L.R. 244, which arose out of a vendor’s and purchaser’s motion for an order that the particular restrictive covenant there objected to offended against the terms of the Racial Discrimination Act, supra. The issue raised in that case was a narrow one, and I shall return to a discussion of it later in my judgment.\nIn this short canvass of the authorities directly applicable, it may not be amiss to point out that, according to an affidavit filed on behalf of the applicant, the present Master of Titles at Toronto has not knowingly permitted anyone to register deeds containing restrictive covenants of a character similar to that in question here, and has on several occasions refused to accept for registration documents containing such covenants, and in no case has an appeal been taken from such refusal.\nThe applicant’s argument is founded on the legal principle, briefly stated in 7 Halsbury, 2nd ed. 1932, pp. 153-4, that: “Any agreement which tends to be injurious to the public or against the public good is void as being contrary to public policy.” Public policy, in the words of Halsbury, “varies from time to time.”\nIn “The Growth of Law”, Mr. Justice Cardozo says: “Existing rules and principles can give us our present location, our bearings, our latitude and longitude. The inn that shelters for the night is not the journey’s end. The law, like the traveller, must be ready for the morrow. It must have a principle of growth.”\nAnd Mr. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, in “The Common Law”, says: “The very considerations which judges most rarely mention and always with an apology are the secret root from which the law draws all the juices of life. I mean, of course, what is expedient for the community concerned.”\nThe matter of not creating new heads of public policy has been discussed at some length by McCardie J. in Naylor, Benzon and Co., Limited v. Krainische Industrie Gesellschaft, [1918] 1 K.B. 331, later affirmed by the Court of Appeal, [1918] 2 K.B. 486. There he points out that “the Courts have not hesitated in the past to apply the doctrine [of public policy] whenever the facts demanded its application.” “The truth of the matter,” he says, “seems to be that public policy is a variable thing. It must fluctuate with the circumstances of the time. This view is exemplified by the decisions which were discussed by the House of Lords in Nordenfelt v. The Maxim Nordenfelt Guns and Ammunition Company, Limited, [1894] A.C. 535 . . . The principles of public policy remain the same, though the application of them may be applied in novel ways. The ground does not vary. As it was put by Tindal C.J. in Horner v. Graves (1831), 7 Bing. 735, 743, 131 E.R. 284. ‘Whatever is injurious to the interests of the public is void, on the grounds of public policy.’”\nIt is a well-recognized rule that courts may look at various Dominion and Provincial Acts and public law as an aid in determining principles relative to public policy: see Walkerville Brewing Co. Ltd. v. Mayrand, 63 O.L.R. 573, [1929] 2 D.L.R. 945.\nFirst and of profound significance is the recent San Francisco Charter, to which Canada was a signatory, and which the Dominion Parliament has now ratified. The preamble to this Charter reads in part as follows:\nWe, the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small . . . and for these ends to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbors . . .\nUnder articles 1 and 55 of this Charter, Canada is pledged to promote “universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.”\nIn the Atlantic Charter, to which Canada has subscribed, the principles of freedom from fear and freedom of worship are recognized.\nSection 1 of the Racial Discrimination Act, supra, provides:\nNo person shall,\n(a) publish or display or cause to be published or displayed; or\n(b) permit to be published or displayed on lands or premises or in a newspaper, through a radio broadcasting station or by means of any other medium which he owns or controls, any notice, sign, symbol, emblem or other representation indicating discrimination or an intention to discriminate against any person or any class of persons for any purpose because of the race or creed of such person or class of persons.\nThe Provincial Legislature further has expressed itself in the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 256, s. 99, as follows: “Any licensed insurer which discriminates unfairly between risks within Ontario because of the race or religion of the insured shall be guilty of an offence.”\nMoreover, under s. 6 of the Regulations passed pursuant to the Community Halls Act, now R.S.O. 1937, c. 284, it is provided that “Every hall erected under this Act shall be available for any public gathering of an educational, fraternal, religious or social nature or for the discussion of any public question, and no organization shall be denied the use of the hall for religious, fraternal or political reasons.”\nProceeding from the general to the particular, the argument of the applicant is that the impugned covenant is void because it is injurious to the public good. This deduction is grounded on the fact that the covenant against sale to Jews or to persons of objectionable nationality prevents the particular piece of land from ever being acquired by the persons against whom the covenant is aimed, and that this prohibition is without regard to whether the land is put to residential, commercial, industrial or other use. How far this is obnoxious to public policy can only be ascertained by projecting the coverage of the covenant with respect both to the classes of persons whom it may adversely affect, and to the lots or subdivisions of land to which it may be attached. So considered, the consequences of judicial approbation of such a covenant are portentous. If sale of a piece of land can be prohibited to Jews, it can equally be prohibited to Protestants, Catholics or other groups or denominations. If the sale of one piece of land can be so prohibited, the sale of other pieces of land can likewise be prohibited. In my opinion, nothing could be more calculated to create or deepen divisions between existing religious and ethnic groups in this province, or in this country, than the sanction of a method of land transfer which would permit the segregation and confinement of particular groups to particular business or residential areas, or, conversely, would exclude particular groups from particular business or residential areas. The unlikelihood of such a policy as a legislative measure is evident from the contrary intention of the recently-enacted Racial Discrimination Act, and the judicial branch of government must take full cognizance of such factors.\nOntario, and Canada too, may well be termed a province, and a country, of minorities in regard to the religious and ethnic groups which live therein. It appears to me to be a moral duty, at least, to lend aid to all forces of cohesion, and similarly to repel all fissiparous tendencies which would imperil national unity. The common law courts have, by their actions over the years, obviated the need for rigid constitutional guarantees in our policy by their wise use of the doctrine of public policy as an active agent in the promotion of the public weal. While courts and eminent judges have, in view of the powers of our legislatures, warned against inventing new heads of public policy, I do not conceive that I would be breaking new ground were I to hold the restrictive covenant impugned in this proceeding to be void as against public policy. Rather would I be applying well-recognized principles of public policy to a set of facts requiring their invocation in the interest of the public good.\nThat the restrictive covenant in this case is directed in the first place against Jews lends poignancy to the matter when one considers that anti-semitism has been a weapon in the hands of our recently-defeated enemies, and the scourge of the world. But this feature of the case does not require innovation in legal principle to strike down the covenant; it merely makes it more appropriate to apply existing principles. If the common law of treason encompasses the stirring up of hatred between different classes of His Majesty’s subjects, the common law of public policy is surely adequate to void the restrictive covenant which is here attacked.\nMy conclusion therefore is that the covenant is void because offensive to the public policy of this jurisdiction. This conclusion is reinforced, if reinforcement is necessary, by the wide official acceptance of international policies and declarations frowning on the type of discrimination which the covenant would seem to perpetuate.\nIt may not be inexpedient or improper to refer to a few declarations made by outstanding leaders under circumstances that arrest the attention and demand consideration of mankind. I first quote the late President Roosevelt:\nCitizens, regardless of religious allegiance, will share in the sorrow of our Jewish fellow-citizens over the savagery of the Nazis against their helpless victims. The Nazis will not succeed in exterminating their victims any more than they will succeed in enslaving mankind. The American people not only sympathize with all victims of Nazi crimes but will hold the perpetrators of these crimes to strict accountability in a day of reckoning which will surely come.\nI express the confident hope that the Atlantic Charter and the just World Order to be made possible by the triumph of the United Nations will bring the Jews and oppressed people in all lands the four freedoms which Christian and Jewish teachings have largely inspired.\nAnd of the Right Honourable Winston Churchill:\nIn the day of victory the Jew’s sufferings and his part in the struggle will not be forgotten. Once again, at the appointed time, he will see vindicated those principles of righteousness which it was the glory of his fathers to proclaim to the world. Once again it will be shown that, though the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small.\nAnd of General Charles de Gaulle:\nBe assured that since we have repudiated everything that has falsely been done in the name of France after June 23rd, the cruel decrees directed against French Jews can and will have no validity in Free France. These measures are not less a blow against the honour of France then they are an injustice against her Jewish citizens.\nWhen we shall have achieved victory, not only will the wrongs done in France itself be righted, but France will once again resume her traditional place as a protagonist of freedom and justice for all men, irrespective of race or religion, in a new Europe.\nAlso, the resolution passed by the representatives of over sixty million organized workers at the World Trade Union Congress recently held at London that “every form of political, economic or social discrimination based on race, creed or sex, shall be eliminated.”\nThe resolution against discrimination adopted unanimously by the Latin American nations and the United States in Mexico City on 6th March 1945, at the time of the Act of Chapultepec, is that the governments of these nations shall “prevent with all the means in their power all that may provoke discrimination among individuals because of racial and religious reasons.”\nIt is provided in art. 123 of The Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, that:\nEquality of rights of citizens of the U.S.S.R., irrespective of their nationality or race, in all spheres of economic, state, cultural, social and political life, is an indefeasible law.\nAny direct or indirect restriction of the rights of, or, conversely, any establishment of direct or indirect privileges for, citizens on account of their race or nationality, as well as any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness or hatred and contempt, is punishable by law.\nThe second point raised by counsel for the applicant is that the covenant is invalid as a restraint on alienation. It is unnecessary to quote authorities in support of the long-established principle of the common law that land should be freely alienable. True, a limited class of exceptions to this general principle has from time to time been recognized, as in In re Macleay (1875), L.R. 20 Eq. 186, though it may be pointed out that this decision runs counter to the earlier case of Attwater v. Attwater (1853), 18 Beav. 330, 52 E.R. 131. Moreover, in In re Rosher; Rosher v. Rosher (1884), 26 Ch. D. 801, Pearson J. stated that he failed to appreciate how the exception recognized in In re Macleay arose. It is not necessary to challenge the doctrine of In re Macleay, which has been followed in some Canadian cases, in order to find that the covenant with which I am concerned is invalid as a restraint on alienation. The particular covenant in the case before me is not limited either in time or to the life of the immediate grantee (see Sweet, Restraints on Alienation, 33 L.Q.R. 236, 342, particularly at p. 354), which would seem to be characteristic of the partial restraints which were enforced in the decided cases that I have been able to find. The principle of freedom of alienation has been too long and two well established in the jurisprudence of English and Canadian courts to warrant me at this late stage in recognizing a limitation upon it of a character not hitherto the subject of any reported case, especially in view of my conclusions as to public policy.\nCounsel for the applicant contended before me that the restrictive covenant here in question is void for uncertainty. So far as the words “persons of objectionable nationality” are concerned, the contention admits of no contradiction. The conveyancer who used these words surely must have realized, if he had given the matter any thought, that no court could conceivably find legal meaning in such vagueness. So far as the first branch of the covenant is concerned, that prohibiting the sale of the land to “Jews”, I am bound by the recent decision of the House of Lords in Clayton et al. v. Ramsden et al., [1943] A.C. 320, [1943] 1 All E.R. 16, to hold that the covenant is in this respect also void for uncertainty; and I may add, that I would so hold even if the matter were res integra. The law lords in Clayton v. Ramsden were unanimous in holding that the phrase “of Jewish parentage” was uncertain, and Lord Romer was of the same opinion with regard to the phrase “of the Jewish faith”. I do not see that the bare term “Jews” admits of any more certainty.\nI should like, in conclusion, to refer to the judgment of Chevrier J. in Re McDougall and Waddell, supra. The learned judge there decided that the registration of a deed containing a covenant restricting the sale or user of land to “Gentiles (non-semetic [sic]) of European or British or Irish or Scottish racial origin” did not constitute an infringement of The Racial Discrimination Act. He came to this conclusion by holding that registration of a deed was not among the proscribed means of publishing or displaying enumerated in s. 1 of the Act. Counsel for the applicant herein contended that these proscribed means related only to the terms of clause (b) of s. 1, and that they did not qualify clause (a) of s. 1, which reads as follows:\nNo person shall, — (a) publish or display or cause to be published or displayed . . . any notice, sign, symbol, emblem, or other representation indicating discrimination or an intention to discriminate against any person or any class of persons for any purpose because of the race or creed of such person or class of persons.\nMr. Cartwright further submitted that if this section had been read by the learned judge without this limitation, registration in the Registry Office constituted publication of a notice or other representation as aforesaid, and that following 29 Halsbury, 2nd ed. 1938, p. 444, “registration constitutes actual notice to all the world”, therefore he should have found that the particular clause was in breach of the said Act.\nI do not deem it necessary for the purpose of this case to deal with this argument, except to say that it appears to me to have considerable merit. My opinion as to the public policy applicable to this case in no way depends on the terms of The Racial Discrimination Act, save to the extent that such Act constitutes a legislative recognition of the policy which I have applied; in fact my brother Chevrier, as I read his judgment in Re McDougall and Waddell, is in accord with me in this respect.\nAn order will therefore go declaring that the restrictive covenant attacked by the applicant is void and of no effect.\nOrder accordingly.\n"},{"id":158,"href":"/casebook/title/walker/","title":"Re Walker","section":"Chapter 3","content":" Middleton J.A. — # An appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Riddell pronounced on the 27th September, 1924, declaring that the estate of the late Ellen Fitze Walker does not include any part of the estate of the late John Walker undisposed of by her at the time of her death.\nJohn Walker died on the 27th March, 1903, and first made his will, bearing date the 17th November, 1902, which was in due course admitted to probate, his widow being his sole executrix. At the time of his death his estate amounted to approximately $16,000. By his will he provided as follows:\n\u0026ldquo;I give and devise unto my said wife all my real and personal property saving and excepting thereout as follows namely my gold watch and chain I give to my nephew John Noble Walker son of my brother William Walker and all other jewellery I may have at the time of my decease I give to my nephews William Craig Walker and Percy Dugald Walker brothers of the said John Noble Walker share and share alike and also should any portion of my estate still remain in the hands of my said wife at the time of decease undisposed of by her such remainder shall be divided follows …\u0026rdquo;\nThe widow survived until 1922. Her will has been duly admitted to probate. Her estate, including all that remained of her husband\u0026rsquo;s estate, was valued at $38,000.\nThose claiming under the husband\u0026rsquo;s will seek to have some portion of this estate earmarked as being an \u0026ldquo;undisposed of\u0026rdquo; portion of the husband\u0026rsquo;s estate. Those claiming under the wife\u0026rsquo;s will contend that under the provision of the husband\u0026rsquo;s will the widow took absolutely. Mr. Justice Riddell decided in favour of those claiming under the husband\u0026rsquo;s will. From this decision an appeal is now had.\nFrom the earliest times the attempt has been made to accomplish the impossible, to give and yet to withhold, to confer an absolute estate upon the donee, and yet in certain events to resume ownership and to control the destiny of the thing given. By conveyance this is impossible. Where there is absolute ownership, that ownership confers upon the owner the rights of an owner and restrains an alienation; and similar attempts to mould and control the law are void: In re Rosher (1884), 26 Ch. D. 801.\nAs long ago as 1498 (13 Hen. VII. 22, 23, pi. 9), Bryan, C.J., interrupted counsel arguing before him that a condition on a fee simple not to alien was good, saying that the Court \u0026ldquo;would not hear him argue this conceit, because it is simply contrary to common learning and is now, so to speak, a principle … because in this way we should transpose all our old precedents. Therefore speak no more of this point:\u0026rdquo; Gray\u0026rsquo;s Restraints on the Alienation of Property, 2nd ed., pp. 9, 10.\nBy an executory devise testators succeed in many cases in attaining that which would have otherwise been impossible — creating a future right which would on the happening of certain events come into existence and terminate a pre-existing estate in fee simple, but limits have been placed upon this right constituting exceptions to the general rule that an estate given by will may be defeated on the happening of any event.\nOne of these exceptions may, in my opinion, be expressed in this manner, that any executory devise, defeating or abridging an estate in fee by altering the course of its devolution, which is to take effect at the moment of devolution and at no other time, is bad. The reason alleged for that is the contradiction or contrariety between the principle of law which regulates the devolution of the estate and the executory devise which is to take effect only at the moment of devolution, and to alter its course … Another exception to the general proposition which I have stated is this, that any executory devise which is to defeat an estate, and who is to take effect on the exercise of any of the rights incident to the estate, is void; and there again the alleged reason is the contrariety or contradiction existing between the nature of the estate given and the nature of the executory devise over. A very familiar illustration is this, that any executory devise to take effect on an alienation, or an attempt at alienation, is void, because the right of alienation is incident to every estate in fee simple as to every other estate. Another illustration of the same principle is that which arises where the exercise of the executory devise over is made to take effect upon not alienating, because the right to enjoy without alienation is incident to the estate given.\nI quote Fry, J. Shaw v. Ford(1877), 7 Ch. D. 669, 673, 674), and as complementary to this quotation I would refer to the learned discussion of this case in the decision of O\u0026rsquo;Connor, M.E., in an Irish case, In re O\u0026rsquo;Hare, [1918] 1 I.E. 160.\nWhen a testator gives property to one, intending him to have all the rights incident to ownership, and adds to this a gift over of that which remains in specie at his death or at the death of that person, he is endeavouring to do that which is impossible. His intention is plain but it cannot be given effect to. The Court has then to endeavour to give such effect to the wishes of the testator as is legally possible, by ascertaining which part of the testamentary intention predominates and by giving effect to it, rejecting the subordinate intention as being repugnant to the dominant intention.\nSo the cases fall into two classes: the first, in which the gift to the person first named prevails and the gift over fails as repugnant; the second, in which the first named takes a life-estate only, and so the gift over prevails. Subject to an apparent exception to be mentioned, there is no middle course, and in each case the inquiry resolves itself into an endeavour to apply this rule to the words of the will in question. The sheep are separated from the goats; and, while in most instances there is not much doubt, in some instances the classification is by no means easy.\nSpeaking generally, no aid can be derived from reported decisions which do not establish a principle but simply seek to apply an established principle to a particular document. Nothing can well be added to the statements of Jessel, M.E., in Aspden v. Seddon (1874), L.E. 10 Ch. 397, note, and of Collins, M.R., in Foulger v. Arding, [1902] 1 K.B. 700. These being readily accessible, I refrain from quoting at length, only extracting a few words from the earlier decision (p. 397):\nI think it is the duty of a Judge to ascertain the construction of the instrument before him, and not to refer to the construction put by another Judge upon an instrument, perhaps similar, but not the same.\nNo better illustration of the danger of relying upon earlier decisions and disregarding the document under consideration can be found than in the cases dealing with this very subject. Constable v. Bull, 3 DeG. \u0026amp; Sm. 411, always cited, is a most unsatisfactory case, because the Court, while recognising the true rule, did great violence to the words of the will. Re Sheldon and Kemble(1885), 53 L.T.R. 537, followed, and instead of seeking to apply the rule to the will there in question the Court tried to distinguish between the words of the will in the case in hand and the words of the will in the earlier case. An Australian case, Wright v. Wright, [1913] Vict. L.R. 358, points out the unsatisfactory result.\nTo quote again from Sir George Jessel\u0026rsquo;s judgment (L.R. 10 Ch. at p. 398), already referred to, \u0026ldquo;And so the construction has gone on until we find a document which is in totally different terms from the first, and which no human being would think of construing in the same manner, but which has by this process come to be construed in the same manner.\u0026rdquo;\nA note in 40 L.Q.R., 3.93-395, discusses this principle and refers to other cases.\nI have referred to an apparent exception to the rule which might be regarded as constituting a third class of cases into which some fall. These are cases in which all that is given to the first taker is a life-estate, but the life-tenant is given a power of sale which may be exercised at any time during the currency of his estate. There is no doubt that this may be validly done. It is not uncommon in cases where property is held in trust. In such cases power of sale is frequently vested in trustees who are empowered to sell and pay the purchase-money to the life-tenant for his maintenance. Re Johnson (1912), 27 O.L.R. 472, is a good example. These cases constitute only an apparent exception to the rule because in them there is no conflict upon the face of the gift. Whether a case can be brought within this class is altogether a matter of construction, and the will here in hand plainly does not fall within it.\nThe case of Shearer v. Hogg (1912), 46 Can. S.C.R. 492, affirming the judgment in Shearer v. Forman (1911), Q.R. 40 S.C. 139, is sometimes referred to as in conflict with these views. It is a case governed by the Civil Law, which recognises substitution \u0026ldquo;de residuo\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;de eo quod supererit\u0026rdquo; something quite unknown to the English law. The Court was endeavouring to ascertain the intention of the testator to determine if there was a valid substitution. The remarks as to the similarity of the law of the two Provinces must be taken as directed to the duty of the Court to ascertain the intention of the testator and when it is possible so to do to give effect to it. The Supreme Court decision is more readily understood when the judgment in the Court below is read.\nTurning now to the will before the Court. I agree with the judgment in review that the words \u0026ldquo;undisposed of\u0026rdquo; do not refer to a testamentary disposition by the widow but refer to a disposal by her during her lifetime. I am, however, unable to agree with the construction placed upon the will otherwise. It appears to be plain that there is here an attempt to deal with that which remains undisposed of by the widow, in a manner repugnant to the gift to her. I think the gift to her must prevail and the attempted gift over must be declared to be repugnant and void.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and declare the construction of the will accordingly. Costs may well come out of the wife\u0026rsquo;s estate.\nAppeal allowed.\n"},{"id":159,"href":"/context/reading-and-rereading-harrison/","title":"Reading Harrison","section":"Context","content":" Reading Harrison # By Elyse Loewen, CC BY NC SA 4.0\nThe first case we’ll read in this course\u0026ndash;the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in Harrison v Carswell\u0026ndash;is about a labour dispute at the Polo Park shopping mall in Winnipeg in the mid-1970s. That setting may not strike you as obviously important or exciting, but Harrison is arguably one of the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s most important decisions for what it reveals about the central problems and debates in property law, and\u0026ndash;more important still\u0026ndash;for what it shows us about how judges and lawyers engage in those debates using the patterns and practices of common law legal argument.\nThis week, I am only asking you to read a single case, and a reasonably short one at that. But I am asking you to read that case twice, with two different sets of questions in mind. These two sets of questions correspond to the two versions of Harrison v Carswell below.\nTo begin, read the first version of Harrison with the following questions in mind:\nWhat are the basic facts of the case? Do the two different judges in the case (Justices Dickson and Laskin) emphasize or describe different facts?\nWhat is the central issue in the case? Can you describe that issue both in formal legal jargon and in everyday terms?\nWhat is the procedural history of the case (i.e. the outcomes for the parties in the courts below)?\nWhat is the final result in the case? Who wins and who loses? Which judge sides with which party?\nWhat do the judges mean by \u0026ldquo;trespass\u0026rdquo;? What do they mean by \u0026ldquo;possession\u0026rdquo;? How are these two concepts related?\nNote that, at this point, I am specifically not asking you to focus on the reasoning behind the two judges\u0026rsquo; decisions, or about which set of reasons you agree or disagree with. We will address those important questions later.\nRe-reading Harrison # Now that you have a handle on the basic features of Harrison v Carswell, I would like you to read the case again. This time, try to focus on the reasons behind Justice Dickson\u0026rsquo;s and Chief Justice Laskin\u0026rsquo;s respective decisions.\nTo help you with this task, I have colour-coded the two main argumentive structures in the case as they appear in each judge\u0026rsquo;s decision. Try to think about the two judges as being engaged in a process of argumentation with one another. To that end, you can jump between one judge\u0026rsquo;s argument and the other\u0026rsquo;s corresponding counter-argument using the buttons provided in the text.\nThis structure of argument and counter-argument (or, symmetrical \u0026ldquo;argument pairs\u0026rdquo;) captures the basic form of common law vocabulary, i.e. the way that judges, lawyers and other jurists speak to one another in their attempts to resolve legal disputes.1 This concept of \u0026ldquo;argument pairs\u0026rdquo; may seem like a fairly straightforward\u0026ndash;even obvious\u0026ndash;one. But the simple dynamic of argument and counter-argument carries with it two very important features. First is the reality that there are only so many different argument pairs available to jurists, meaning that the common law vocabulary\u0026ndash;complex as it might seem\u0026ndash;actually builds on a relatively small number of highly patterned arguments. Second is the deep assumption that legal problems are actually resolved through this type of argumentative dialogue. As we move through the course this year, we will test that fundamental assumption from various perspectives.\nWhile you read Harrison v Carswell a second time keep the following questions in mind:\nCan you summarize, in your own words, the two main argument pairs in the case?\nWhy is the Peters case significant?\nWhy do the two judges differ in how they think the case should be resolved? Do they simply come to different conclusions based on their understandings of the facts and the law? What else might be going on?\nWhich judge\u0026rsquo;s decision do you find more convincing, and why?\nHarrison Revisited # Source: Jon Tyson on Unsplash\nIn our final week of the course, our aim is to revisit where we started by way of review, synopsis, and an attempt to gauge what we have learned.\nRecall that, when we first read the Supreme Court\u0026rsquo;s decision in Harrison v Carswell in Weeks 1 and 2, we analyzed the case in terms of its \u0026ldquo;vocabulary\u0026rdquo;—that is, the structure of argument and counter-argument used explicitly by the judges to justify their legal conclusions on the facts. Left unanswered in that analysis was the question of how we know which judge\u0026rsquo;s decision, as a whole, is more persuasive from a legal perspective.\nWe can now return to that question and apply the tools for analyzing the \u0026ldquo;grammar\u0026rdquo; of common law thought that we have developed throughout the course.\nIn Unit 4, we have seen that a hallmark of the contemporary style of common law thought is for judges to draw on the assumptions and techniques of both classical and modern styles to arrive at a pragmatic resolution of the case. In several examples, we have seen these styles mixed and used together in course of a single decision.\nHarrison v Carswell presents an alternative result born out of the tendency for contemporary courts to abandon any unified consensus around whether to foreground competition or control, whether to reinforce or collapse the distinction between public and private, or whether to embrace formalism versus functionalism. Instead, in Harrison, Justices Dickson and Laskin engage in a kind of direct clash between classical and modern styles. As you re-read the judgment, consider what this structure implies for answering the question: whose judgement is the correct one?\nDuncan Kennedy, \u0026ldquo;A semiotics of legal argument\u0026rdquo; (1991) 42 Syracuse Law Review 75.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":160,"href":"/casebook/shelter/waterloo/","title":"Regional Municipality of Waterloo v Persons Unknown and to be Ascertained","section":"Chapter 4","content":" Valente J. \u0026ndash; # Introduction # The issue in this application of The Regional Municipality of Waterloo (the ‘Region’) concerns the prohibition against erecting any type of structure, including a tent, on the Region-owned property, municipally known as 100 Victoria Street North, in the city of Kitchener (the ‘Property’). More generally, however, the Region’s application touches on the unfortunate, complex and nationwide social issue of homelessness.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe By-Law # It is undisputed that the Municipal Act gives the Region the express authority to pass by-laws respecting its public assets and the protection of persons and property (see , 9, and 11(2)). It is also acknowledged that the Trespass to Property Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.T21, as amended, ss. 3 to 8 (the \u0026lsquo;TPA\u0026rsquo;) allows an occupier of premises to prohibit or regulate entry onto premises and that the Courts have recognized municipalities as occupiers.\nPursuant to the Municipal Act, the Region enacted the By-Law in December 2013. The By-Law prohibits certain activities on lands owned or occupied by the Region. The prohibited activities include erecting, without authorization, any form of structure on the lands as well as bringing any dangerous, illegal or flammable goods on the lands that are likely to cause injury or damage to the lands.\nThe purpose of the By-Law is to (i) prevent physical damage to the lands owned or occupied by the Region (the \u0026lsquo;Designated Premises\u0026rsquo;) (ii) prevent the disruption of the Region\u0026rsquo;s operations on the Designated Premises; and (iii) regulate the use and enjoyment of the Designated Premises by other persons.\nThe Region\u0026rsquo;s remedies pursuant to the By-Law are to lay a charge and/or exercise its available remedies under the TPA. These include issuing a written notice or posting a sign prohibiting the impugned conduct and/or requiring the person engaged in the prohibited activity to leave the property in question.\nPrior to December 2021, the By-Law was used by the Region to address and regulate homeless encampment complaints. In late November 2021, the Region\u0026rsquo;s by-law enforcement staff attended at a homeless encampment at 34 Stirling Street East, in the city of Kitchener (the \u0026lsquo;Stirling Encampment\u0026rsquo;) to enforce the provisions of the By-Law prohibiting unauthorized occupation of Region-owned public lands. To assist with the eviction of the encampment residents, and because of certain health and safety con\nWhile the Region\u0026rsquo;s Planning, Development, and Legislative Services and Legal Services Report to Regional Council of December 15, 2021 (the \u0026lsquo;December 2021 Report\u0026rsquo;), maintains that the steps undertaken to evict the Stirling Encampment occupants \u0026ldquo;were consistent with the requirements of the [B]y-law,\u0026rdquo; the same Report concedes that \u0026ldquo;the manner in which these actions were carried out did not reflect the dignity of those living at the encampment.\u0026rdquo;\nAs a result, the Region conducted a review of its then existing encampment eviction process and proposed a draft policy to Regional Council to supplement the By-Law as it specifically applies to homeless encampments. The draft policy was approved by Regional Council on December 15, 2021 (the \u0026lsquo;Encampment Policy\u0026rsquo;). The details of the Encampment Policy are discussed below.\n100 Victoria Street North, Kitchener # The Region acquired the Property in November 2012. The Property is located on the corner of Victoria and Weber Streets in the city of Kitchener and is approximately one-half acre in size. It is a gravel parking lot. The VIA Rail/GO Transit and bus stations are to the east of the Property, a commercial plaza lies directly to the west, and a Metrolinx owned rail corridor is to the north. To the south of the Property are a variety of businesses and a church, including St. John\u0026rsquo;s Kitchen, which provides meals during weekdays to persons in need.\nIn May 2018, the Region and the province of Ontario entered into a Transfer Payment Agreement for the partial funding of the King Victoria Transit Hub (the \u0026lsquo;Hub\u0026rsquo;). The Hub is a new train/bus station for the Region in close proximity to the Property. The Hub will require construction on Region lands. While there are no plans for any construction on the Property, the Region intends to use the Property in the short-term for additional motor vehicle parking for the VIA Rail and GO Transit stations across the street due to an anticipated increased use of the stations with the decline of the pandemic and as a lay-down area for the construction of the Hub. No evidence was, however, proffered by the Region respecting the immediate need for increased parking spaces to accommodate anticipated demand and although the evidence of Ellen McGaghey, the Region\u0026rsquo;s Director of Facilities and Fleet Management, is that the construction of the Hub is projected for spring 2023, Ms. McGaghey admitted in cross-examination that there is no firm construction start date.\nIn the long-term, the Region intends to use the Property for approximately one hundred dedicated transit customer parking spaces for the new Hub train/bus station. As a term of the Transfer Payment Agreement, the one hundred dedicated parking spaces are required of the Region upon the completion of the first stage of the Hub. It is projected that the contractually required parking will be required some time in late 2024, but there is no firm completion date.\nHomelessness in the Region # In 2014, the Region was the first Canadian community to count the number of people found to be experiencing homelessness. In 2018, the federal and provincial governments mandated bi-annual \u0026ldquo;Point in Time Counts\u0026rdquo; of the number of people experiencing homelessness. Based on the Region\u0026rsquo;s Point in Time Count that was completed in September 2021, there were approximately 1,085 people experiencing homelessness in the Region. According to Kelly-Anne Salerno, Assistant Director of Housing Operations and Administration for the Region, the approximate 1,100 count is the most reliable information available on the extent of homelessness in the Region. According to the September 2021 Point in Time Count report, the number of people experiencing homelessness in the Region tripled from 2018 to 2021.\nIn addition to the number of homeless in the Region, the Point in Time Count report also contains data about the demographics of the homeless in the Region. Specifically, of the 1085 experiencing homelessness, 412 were living rough (living on the street, sleeping in parks or squatting in temporary shelter), 385 were experiencing hidden homelessness (provisionally accommodated; couch surfing), 191 were accessing emergency shelters and 63 were institutionalized. Of the individuals who completed a survey during the Point in Time Count, 75% had been experiencing homelessness for more than six months in the last year, 30% of those counted were women, 67% were men, 10% were transgender, Two-Spirit or non-binary. Additionally, of the individuals counted, 17% identified as Indigenous or First Nations and 15% identified as part of a racialized community.\nThe Encampment # In or around December 2021, a small number of people began erecting tents on the Property without the Region\u0026rsquo;s permission. Over the following six months, approximately 70 temporary shelters were erected to house some 50 people on the Property (the \u0026lsquo;Encampment\u0026rsquo;). As of the hearing of the application, no current evidence was provided with respect to the number of tents and number of homeless persons living on the Property. The most reliable evidence is that, on July 27, 2022, the Region surveyed 53 residents living in the Encampment.\nIn March 2022 the Region hired Barber Collins Security to monitor the Encampment, to respond to any disruptions and to respond to any complaints from the public, and specifically, from the businesses located in the plaza to the south of the Property. In May 2022, the Region authorized the Barber Collins security staff to be posted at the entrance of the St. John\u0026rsquo;s Kitchen to permit overnight access to the washrooms located at this facility.\nAs of July 2022, the Region\u0026rsquo;s monthly costs associated with its response to the Encampment was approximately $80,000. This cost not only included security services, but also garbage pick-up and janitorial services to clean the St. John\u0026rsquo;s Kitchen washrooms.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe Encampment Policy # The December 2021 Report recommending Regional Council\u0026rsquo;s acceptance of the Encampment Policy states that the By-Law \u0026ldquo;has broad application to a wide range of prohibited activities\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;[a]s a result, specific direction as to the timing and manner of enforcement is not set out in the bylaw.\u0026rdquo; The Encampment Policy, as adopted by Regional Council on December 15, 2021, is intended to provide that direction for enforcement.\nThe Encampment Policy seeks to guide Regional staff in providing outreach services to homeless persons living on the Region\u0026rsquo;s lands and to balance the need to provide \u0026ldquo;appropriate supports to vulnerable individuals and the civic responsibility of maintaining the use of these lands for the public and/or operational requirements of the municipality.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Encampment Policy specifies 4 guiding principles that are to be followed prior to undertaking any encampment eviction. These guiding principles, as quoted from the Encampment Policy, are as follows:\nThe Region\u0026rsquo;s priority is to assist individuals to access safer, sustainable, and healthier alternatives, not enforcement. Enforcement will only occur after all reasonable support efforts have been attempted without success and with reasonable advance notice of the requirement to vacate a public space. In exceptional circumstances, however, more immediate intervention may be required to address public safety concerns.\nRegional staff, supported by community social service agencies, will work with individuals living outside to respond to their individual needs on a case-by-case basis by providing access to services, supports and shelter. The Region will use a co-ordinated approach between Regional departments in responding to the needs and issues related to individuals living rough or experiencing homelessness.\nThe Region will engage in ongoing proactive communication with individuals experiencing homelessness, service providers, regional councillors, community agencies and other groups.\nThe Region acknowledges that individuals living rough cannot be forced to accept services and supports. However, the refusal of an individual to accept services and supports is not sufficient reason to prevent the enforcement of Regional by-laws.\nIn practical terms, the Encampment Policy provides for a two-step approach prior to enforcement of the By-Law.\nThe first step calls for the Region\u0026rsquo;s Community Services department to reach out to persons experiencing homelessness to encourage and assist them in accessing safer and healthier alternatives, including housing, support services, shelter and more permanent housing options. The anticipation of the Region is that, over time, individuals who are being so assisted will choose these better alternatives and will voluntarily leave the Region\u0026rsquo;s encampments.\nStep two requires that enforcement occur only after all reasonable outreach and support efforts have been provided without success and after reasonable notice of the need to vacate has been given. Once the prescribed protocols have been followed and a decision to evict is made, enforcement shall be completed in a way that respects both the safety of all concerned and the dignity of the individuals experiencing homelessness.\nThe Minutes of the December 15, 2021, meeting of Regional Council approving the Encampment Policy, record the solicitor for the Region, Jeff Schelling, having advised Council prior to their vote that the \u0026ldquo;new policy provides a greater emphasis on outreach and communication, with enforcement as a last option.\u0026rdquo;\nBecause Regional Council passed a by-law to confirm its action of December 15, 2021, the Named Respondents would have me find that the Encampment Policy has the authority of a by-law. While I do not agree that Regional Council\u0026rsquo;s confirmation by-law has the effect proposed by the Named Respondents, I find that the Encampment Policy supplements the By-Law by providing specific principles and processes to be followed when addressing homeless encampment issues.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSection 7 of the Charter # Section 7 of the Charter provides:\nEveryone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\nThe onus is on the rights claimant to establish on a balance of probabilities that the impugned legislation deprives him or her of either life, liberty, of security of the person, and that the deprivation is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. Should the claimant be successful in this respect, then the burden shifts to the respondent, under section 1, to justify the deprivation as a \u0026ldquo;reasonable\u0026rdquo; limit that is \u0026ldquo;demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society: see Michaud, at para. 60. The same principles apply in regard to section 15(1) of the Charter: see Abbotsford (City) v. Shantz, at para. 226.\nI add one qualification to the above analysis described by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Michaud, based on the statement of Chief Justice McLachlin in Charkaoui, who explained, at para. 12, that the first of the two steps to be established by the moving party are meant to examine whether \u0026ldquo;there has been or could be a deprivation of the right to life, liberty or security of the person.\u0026rdquo;\nSection 7 and the History of the \u0026ldquo;Right to Shelter\u0026rdquo; Cases # As homelessness continues to be a growing and problematic issue across Canada, the jurisprudence has continued to develop. In Bamberger v. Vancouver (Board of Parks and Recreation), Justice Kirchner summarized the development of the British Columbia caselaw regarding the \u0026lsquo;right to shelter\u0026rsquo; at paragraphs 11-20:\nIn Adams BCSC, Madam Justice Ross found a Victoria bylaw prohibiting homeless persons from erecting temporary shelters in Victoria parks infringed their right to life, liberty, and security of the person, as guaranteed by section 7. She found the number of homeless persons in Victoria far outnumbered the available shelter beds such that many of Victoria\u0026rsquo;s homeless were forced to sleep outside. Despite this, the city\u0026rsquo;s bylaw prohibited anyone from erecting temporary shelters, including tents, tarps, or even cardboard boxes, in public parks, leaving them exposed to serious and life-threatening conditions and depriving them of their dignity, independence, and ability to protect themselves.\nAfter a refinement of Ross J.\u0026rsquo;s order by the Court of Appeal, it was declared that the offending sections of Victoria\u0026rsquo;s Park Regulation Bylaw were \u0026ldquo;inoperative insofar and only insofar as they apply to prevent homeless people from erecting temporary overnight shelter in parks when the number of homeless people exceeds the number of available shelter beds in the City of Victoria\u0026rdquo;: Adams BCCA at para. 166.\nThe constitutional right as articulated in Adams was thus circumscribed in two respects: (1) the right is exercisable when the number of homeless outnumbered the available indoor sheltering spaces, and (2) the right to erect a temporary shelter is confined to overnight hours.\nSince Adams, many municipal bylaws and government actions that seek to limit or restrict the ability of persons experiencing homelessness to erect and maintain shelters have come under challenge in this court, including in: Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation v. Williams; Abbotsford (City) v. Shantz; British Columbia v. Adamson; British Columbia v. Adamson; Nanaimo (City) v. Courtoreille; Vancouver Fraser Port Authority v. Brett; and, most recently, Prince George (City) v. Stewart.\nThe basic constitutional right as framed in Adams has remained largely unchanged. However, it is now recognized that it is not just the number of available indoor sheltering spaces that frames the right but also whether those spaces are truly accessible to those sheltering in parks. In Shantz, for example, Hinkson C.J.S.C. stated:\nGiven the personal circumstances of the City\u0026rsquo;s homeless, the shelter spaces that are presently available to others in the City are impractical for many of the City\u0026rsquo;s homeless. They simply cannot abide by the rules required in many of the facilities that I have discussed above, and lack the means to pay the required rents at others.\nMore recently, in Stewart, Hinkson C.J.S.C. stated:\nIt is apparent that very few of the emergency shelter beds are low barrier, and it appears that many of the homeless persons in the City are ineligible to stay in at least some of the shelters. While the City contends that the availability of 81 shelter beds in the City is sufficient to house the encampment occupants, I am not satisfied that these shelter spaces are in fact accessible to all of the occupants of the encampments.\nThe question of sheltering in public parks during daytime hours has also arisen in the cases since Adams, but the jurisprudence, thus far, has not extended the right to include it, at least not expressly. In Shantz at para. 276, Hinkson C.J.S.C. found \u0026ldquo;there is a legitimate need for people to shelter and rest during the day and no indoor shelter in which to do so\u0026rdquo; but held that a \u0026ldquo;minimally impairing response to balancing that need with the interests of other users\u0026rdquo; of the parks would be to allow overnight sheltering between 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m.\nHowever, in Adamson No. 1 and Stewart, Hinkson C.J.S.C. declined to grant injunctions to close specific homeless encampments and made no specific qualification that those sheltering in the parks could only do so during overnight hours. In Adamson No. 1, Hinkson C.J.S.C. did not squarely address the issue of daytime sheltering but nor did he tailor a remedy to require the encampment to be removed at sunrise.\nIn Steward, he addressed the issue more directly, noting at para. 73 that the closure of shelter spaces due to COVID-19 resulted in scores of people having nowhere to shelter \u0026ldquo;in either the daytime or the nighttime.\u0026rdquo; He observed that these persons did not remove their tents or vacate the encampment each morning. In declining to grant the injunction, at least in respect of one, he did not consider or grant a more limited injunction that would restrict sheltering to overnight hours. He took judicial notice of the fact that \u0026ldquo;Prince George can be very cold in the fall and winter, and that people with nowhere warm to stay must find ways of keeping warm to stay alive\u0026rdquo;: Stewart at para. 64.\nThus, while neither Adamson No. 1 nor Stewart purport to expand the scope of the constitutional right to daytime sheltering, it was not specifically enjoined in either case.\nThe essence of the British Columbia decisions is the establishment of a constitutional right to shelter oneself when the number of homeless persons exceed the number of available and accessible indoor shelter spaces within a given jurisdiction.\nWhile the Region acknowledges the British Columbia jurisprudence, it submits that these decisions have been distinguished by Ontario decisions on the basis of an obiter comment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Adams and the Region urges me to follow these Ontario rulings.\nThe British Court of Appeal stated, at para. 109:\nWe agree with the trial judge that prohibiting the homeless from taking simple measures to protect themselves through the creation or utilization of rudimentary forms of overhead protection, in circumstances where there is no practicable shelter alternative, is a significant interference with their dignity and independence. The choice to shelter oneself in this context is properly included in the right to liberty under .\nHowever, the Court then goes on to comment in obiter as follows at para. 162:\nIf there were adequate shelter beds or appropriate designated areas outside of parks to accommodate the homeless, the Bylaw provisions that we are concerned with might well be valid.\nIn the recent Ontario decisions of Black v. Toronto (City), 2020 ONSC 6398, 152 O.R. (3d) 529 [Black] and Poff v. City of Hamilton, 2021 ONSC 7224 [Poff] homeless individuals sought an injunction to prevent the municipality from evicting them from city parks. In both instances, the Ontario Courts considered the British Columbia decisions and distinguished them on the basis of a factual finding that there were adequate shelter spaces to accommodate all of the cities\u0026rsquo; homeless.\nIn Black, Justice Schabas found, at para. 149, that the city of Toronto had addressed the applicants\u0026rsquo; fears of COVID-19 in the shelter system \u0026ldquo;such that there are adequate safe alternatives to sleeping in encampments.\u0026rdquo;\nLikewise, in Poff, Justice Goodman, at para. 235, differentiated the facts in Adams and from those before him on the basis that in the cases the Court found \u0026ldquo;there was insufficient shelter space in the city to house all the city\u0026rsquo;s homeless people.\u0026rdquo;. This, according to Justice Goodman, at para. 236, \u0026ldquo;is not the situation in .\u0026rdquo;\nGiven these factual findings, and in following the suggested path of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Adams, the Ontario Courts ruled that there was no breach of section 7.\nIn the alternative, to urge my following the Black and Poff decisions, the Region submits that provided I find that there is adequate capacity in the shelter system to accommodate the residents of the Encampment, I should nonetheless find that the By-Law does not violate the rights of the Encampment residents.\nApart from the position that there are not sufficient available spaces in the Region to shelter its homeless population, the Named Respondents and Amicus Curiae submit that it is not simply the number of available shelter spaces that frames the rights but also whether those spaces are truly accessible to the homeless. They also argue that the Ontario decisions mentioned above are distinguishable from the case before me on the basis that the two encampments, each in the cities of Toronto and Hamilton, were located in municipal parks and not in a vacant lot. Whereas the Ontario Courts found that there was significant public interest in ensuring that everyone had access to the parks, there is no such public interest in the Property.\nBased on the record before me, I find that despite the Region\u0026rsquo;s past and current impressive efforts to accommodate its homeless population, there are not sufficient shelter spaces. I find that the number of homeless persons in the Region far outnumber the available shelter beds such that many of the Region\u0026rsquo;s homeless have no alternative but to sleep outside. The most reliable evidence is that the Region has a homeless population of approximately 1,100 individuals. Excluding the motel spaces (because their availability is at the discretion of the motel operators and in many cases the rooms are available only to those with acute or severe medical needs or families), the most current information is that the Region has a maximum capacity of 416 shelter spaces. Even with the inclusion of the rooms at the YWCA and Working Centre (the Cambridge Shelter Overflow beds having already been included in the 416 available shelter spaces) the Region has a current capacity to shelter approximately 553 individuals (calculated on the assumption that each of the 23 families to be housed through the YWCA motel booking have 4 members). The available shelter spaces, unfortunately, fall short by some 50% of what is required. This result, in my opinion, does not equate to \u0026ldquo;adequate safe alternatives to sleeping in encampments\u0026rdquo; in the words of Justice Schabas.\nFurthermore, I accept that it is simply not a matter of counting the number of spaces. To be of any real value to the homeless population, the space must meet their diverse needs, or in other words, the spaces must be truly accessible. If the available spaces are impractical for homeless individuals, either because the shelters do not accommodate couples, are unable to provide required services, impose rules that cannot be followed due to addictions, or cannot accommodate mental or physical disability, they are not low barrier and accessible to the individuals they are meant to serve. Although not binding on me, I adopt and follow the decisions of the British Columbia Supreme Court in Shantz, Prince George (City) v Stewart and Bamberger, all of which hold that in order for the shelter spaces to be truly available, they must in fact be low barrier or accessible to accommodate the homeless population.\nFinally, I reject the Region\u0026rsquo;s submission that, at the end of the day, in order to grant the relief it seeks, I need only be satisfied that there is sufficient capacity in the system to accommodate the Encampment residents. I reject this proposition because of the fluctuating and variable capacity of the system based on the Region\u0026rsquo;s own numbers. Furthermore, were I to be guided by this principle, and satisfied that there is a sufficient bed capacity for the Encampment residents on any given day, how does this approach respond to the many other vulnerable homeless individuals in the Region? It does not. The approach is particularly problematic in my view because the Region intends to be guided by this decision in its treatment of other encampments. Were I to accede to the Region\u0026rsquo;s submission, it seems to me I would be helping to create an immediate disadvantage for those who are homeless and living outside encampments. I am not prepared to do that. Finally, even if I were to accept the Region\u0026rsquo;s suggested approach, I am not satisfied that the Region has adequate capacity to shelter the approximately 50 Encampment residents given that its shelters are not low barrier or truly accessible.\n[Justice Valente went on to find that the by-law at issue violates the section 7 Charter rights of the claimants that it deprives the homeless residents of the Encampment of life, liberty and security of the person in a manner not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice and is not saved by section 1 of the Charter. The Court found that the by-law was inoperative \u0026ldquo;insofar, and only insofar, as it applies to prevent the residents of the Encampment from living on and erecting temporary shelters without a permit on the Property when the number of homeless persons exceeds the number of available accessible shelter beds in the Region.\u0026rdquo;]\n"},{"id":161,"href":"/casebook/title/restraints-on-alienation/","title":"Restraints on Alienation","section":"Chapter 3","content":" Introduction # Having now studied the roles of possession and exclusion in common law property, this week we move on to examine the context of exit\u0026ndash;that is, how it is that owners extract themselves from property relations. Central to this context is the right to alienate property and the power of owners to place restrictions on alienability. Recall that we have already encountered alienation and restraints on alienation in the context of Aboriginal title going back to the Royal Proclamation in 1763. As we learn this week, the extent to which landowners can and should be able transfer their property rights to others and to place limits on alienation has long raised some pervasive controversies in common law property.\nAs you will see from Blackburn v McCallum and Re Walker, below, courts often place a heavy emphasis on the free alienability of land. Any attempts to restrict free alienability are viewed with considerable skepticism in the classical style—consistent with the liberal ideal that property rights should support individuals to pursue their own ends. For example, in both Blackburn and Walker, the courts scrutinize clauses in a will that purport to limit how or when beneficiaries under that will can transfer the property interests they receive. This emphasis on free alienability has also become crucial for modern understandings of property as the basis for a liberal market economy.\nIn order to understand the controversies around alienability in Blackburn and Walker, we will first need some background on the doctrines of tenure and estates. This is a big and reasonably complex topic that we will return to again next term. To start, the excerpt below offers a historical overview of tenure and estates and explains how these concepts became central to the structure of common law property in land. We will then cover the basic elements of common law estates and practice identifying key interests. These topics will provide the foundation for understanding issues of alienability in the cases that follow.\nRestraints on Alienation and the Estate # In Week 7, we interpreted the issue of remedy in nuisance as an example of the fundamental dilemma facing common law courts working in the liberal tradition. In cases like Canadian Paper Co. and Canadian Copper Co., we saw that it was impossible for one landowner to use their land freely without placing limitations on the rights of other landowners to do the same.\nAttempts to restrain alienation provide another example of this dilemma. In the cases below, the testator (i.e., the person making the will) attempts to place restrictions on the free alienability of property they devise (i.e., pass on through the will). In Walker, that restriction is an attempt to direct what happens to the property once the recipient under the will (the devisee) dies. In Blackburn, the testator attempts to prevent the devisees from \u0026ldquo;encumbering\u0026rdquo; (such as by mortgaging) the land for a period of twenty-five years. From the perspective of the testators in these cases, they are simply exercising their freedom to do with their property whatever they choose. But from the perspective of devisees, the testators\u0026rsquo; actions directly impair their own choices about what to do with their newly acquired property. Once again, the clash of individual freedoms is impossible to reconcile except by some application of societal interventions that weigh and determine whose interests should win out.\nAs you read Walker, next, notice how Justice Middleton employs and interprets the concept of common law estates discussed above to reach his decision.\n"},{"id":162,"href":"/problems/restrictive-covenants/","title":"Restrictive Covenants ","section":"Problems","content":" Sign on a traffic post at the Robie Street / Willow Tree intersection in Halifax.\nPlease listen to this recent NPR Radio documentary about 3000 Funston Street, a piece of vacant land in the Brykerwoods neighbourhood of Austin, Texas. The podcast tells the story of how a restrictive covenant is shaping urban development in the context of the city\u0026rsquo;s long-term strategy to improve access to affordable housing and achieve a more equitable distribution of that housing across the municipality. If you prefer, the website also contains a print version of the radio documentary.\nThe provisions of the restrictive covenant at 3000 Funston Street are included on the website — they are as follows:\nAll lots in Brukenwoods Annex shall be subject to the following restrictions, covenants and conditions:\nAll lots in the tract shall be known and described as residential lots. No structures shall be erected, altered, placed or permitted to remain on any residential building plot other than one detached single family residence, or one duplex apartment, except that private garages for not more than three cars may be constructed and may be attached to or detached from the main residence structure, and servants quarters or one garage apartment may be constructed only after the main residence structure is completed.\nNo building shall be located on any residential building plot nearer than 25 ft. to the front lot line, no nearer than 12 ft. to any side street line. No building except a garage or other out-building located 90 ft. or more from the front lot line shall be located nearer than 5 ft. to any side lot line.\nNo residential structure shall be erected or placed on any building plot, which lot has an area of less than 5750 square ft. or a width of less than 50 ft. at the front building setback line as shown on the recorded plat.\nNo noxious or offensive trade or activity shall be carried on upon any lot, nor shall anything be done thereon which may be or become and annoyance or nuisance to the neighbourhood.\nNo persons of any race other than the white race shall use or occupy any building or any lot, except that this covenant shall not prevent occupant by domestic servants of a different race domiciled with an owner or tenant.\nNo trailer, basement, tent, shack, garage, barn or other out-building erected in the tract shall at any time be used as a residence temporarily or permanently, nor shall any structure of a temporary character be used as a residence.\nThe ground floor area on the main residence structure erected on any building plot shall not be less than 750 square feet for Lots 1 to 16, inclusive, and not less than 850 square feed for Lots 17 to 21, inclusive, each being exclusive of one story open porches and garages.\nThese covenants are to run with the land and shall be binding on all parts and all persons claiming under them until January 1, 1966 at which time said covenants shall be automatically extended for successive periods of ten years unless by vote of the majority of the then owners of the lots it is agreed to change the said covenants in whole or in part.\nIf the parties hereto or any of them or their heirs or assigns shall violate or attempt to violate any of the covenants herein, it shall be lawful for any other person or persons owning any real property situated in said development or subdivision to prospector any proceedings at law or in equity against the person or person violating or attempting to violate any such covenant and whether to prevent him or them from so doing or to recover damages or other dues for such violations.\nInvalidation of any one of these covenants by judgement or court order shall in no wise affect any of the other provisions which shall remain in full force and effect.\nAs we will see below in relation to Re Drummond Wren and Re Noble and Wolf v Alley, legal systems in both Canada and the United States have a long, troubling history of upholding the type of racially restrictive covenants seen in Clause 5 of the 3000 Funston Street covenant. These clauses are no longer enforceable in Canadian law (though in some places, like this West Vancouver neighbourhood, such clauses formally remain on title).\nSuppose that the facts surrounding 3000 Funston Street take place in a Canadian city like Halifax. Which provisions of the restrictive covenant above might limit the use of the land for the development of affordable housing as envisioned by the City of Austin? Would such provisions be valid and enforceable under the legal rules and doctrines we are studying this week?\n"},{"id":163,"href":"/casebook/governance/covenants-public-policy/","title":"Restrictive Covenants and Public Policy","section":"Chapter 2","content":"Certain \u0026ldquo;private\u0026rdquo; forms of land-use regulation are still in widespread use. One of the most pervasive—but often least noticed—is the restrictive covenant.\nFrom one point of view, restrictive covenants look like a fairly straightforward promise by one landowner to another—a promise to refrain from doing something on one\u0026rsquo;s own land. One landowner might promise not to cut down the trees in their yard, for example, or promise not to paint their house a garish shade of bright green. But from a legal perspective, restrictive covenants are much more than this. Not only do covenants represent a sort of contractual promise between parties, they help to define the durable \u0026ldquo;bundle of rights\u0026rdquo; in the land itself—that is, covenants are said to run with the land and can, at least in theory, long outlast the original parties to the covenant. This possibility raises some difficult questions for courts in how they define the basic character of covenants along with their consequences.\nWhat distinguishes a valid, enforceable covenant from an invalid (and therefore unenforceable) one? Part of this determination, as we will see, turns on a set of formal criteria for establishing a valid covenant. But validity can also be determined through an analysis of the various extrinsic reasons why courts might refuse to enforce an otherwise valid covenant. Here, we will focus mainly on the grounds of \u0026ldquo;public policy\u0026rdquo; as a reason for refusing to enforce covenants found to be discriminatory or against other foundational values.\nEven where restrictive covenants meet the formal requirements to run with the land, there may be circumstances in which the terms of a covenant will be rendered invalid. The courts in Re Drummond Wren and Re Noble and Wolfe v Alley address two of these circumstances.\nIn the first, a court might render invalid and unenforceable a restrictive covenant that is against public policy. In Re Drummond Wren, the court was willing to strike down a discriminatory restrictive covenant—similar to the one attached to 3000 Funston Street—on this basis. But in the subsequent case of Re Noble and Wolfe v Alley addressing a restrictive covenant with substantially the same terms—decided just a few years later—the courts refused to rely on grounds of public policy.\nIn the second circumstance, a court might find that a restrictive covenant is a prohibited attempt to restrain alienation. The approach takes us back to our discussion of restraints on alienation. From one perspective, this second grounds might be regarded as a subset of the first, based on the public policy and public interest in ensuring the free alienability of property rights.\nHow could the doctrine of public policy be applied to the restrictive covenant in our case study at 3000 Funston Street for this week? Is it likely that the restrictions preventing the city from building affordable housing on the site might be found invalid according to this doctrine? On some other grounds?\nAs you read the cases below to understand the contours of the doctrine of public policy as applied to restrictive covenants, consider again the features of the modern style of common law reasoning and the extent to which they frame and motivate judicial analysis of these cases.\n"},{"id":164,"href":"/problems/blue-mountain-revisited/","title":"Revisiting Blue Mountain-Birch Cove","section":"Problems","content":"Briefly review the facts of the Blue Mountain-Birch Cove Case study we explored in Week 12, then consider the following questions:\nDoes the decision in Canadian Pacific Railway v Vancouver strengthen the Annapolis Group\u0026rsquo;s claim in de facto expropriation against the Halifax Regional Municipality?

The traditional presumption of English common law is that a riparian owner owns the bed of a non-navigable river or stream to the centre of the watercourse: ad medium filum aquae. Consequently, a riparian owner who holds land on both sides of a river considered \u0026ldquo;non-navigable\u0026rdquo; owns the entire riverbed and has exclusive rights to the river\u0026rsquo;s use .\nThe situation is different with respect to navigable waters. If a river is navigable \u0026ldquo;in fact\u0026rdquo;, then there exists a public right of navigation in that river (i.e. a right to travel over it). It is, in other words, in the nature of a public highway. Title to the beds of these rivers is vested in the Crown.\nThe legal definition of what makes a river navigable or not can involve a fair degree of complexity and is based heavily on the facts. For our purposes, suffice to say that, in making this determination, courts will consider whether the river is navigable along its entire length—meaning that it may be deemed navigable even if points along its length (like rapids or falls) are impossible to navigate.1\nR v Nikal, [1996] 1 SCR 1013.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":166,"href":"/casebook/governance/rivers-and-streams-act/","title":"Rivers and Streams Act","section":"Chapter 2","content":"1.

— # The Court’s objective on this appeal is to find the proper balance between an individual’s right to the continued use and enjoyment of his or her property and the power of the community, expressed through the local municipality, to enhance, by changing the land use regulations, the amenities of surrounding and other affected landowners. As the case arises in Quebec, the specific issue raised is the limitation of previously acquired rights under the Civil Code. However, as this is a public law matter, the principles of land use regulation applicable in the common law provinces concerning legal non-conforming uses are also relevant.\nThe facts are straightforward. The respondents’ country and western cabaret was renamed L’Extase (”Ecstasy”) and the singing cowboys and cowgirls were replaced by nude dancers. Business improved. The bar was said to be [translation] “very busy”. The police increased surveillance, but their heightened interest seemed related to a concern over potential impaired drivers (a concern they have with other bars and nightclubs as well) and the opportunity to look for people against whom warrants were outstanding or who were thought to be in breach of court orders. The evidence was that there was no problem of discipline within the bar itself. Further, there was no evidence that nude floor shows attract more clients in trouble with the law than regular bars or that L’Extase in fact attracted a more problematic clientele than it did when it was a country and western bar.\nMy colleague Gonthier J. takes the view that by changing the form of entertainment the respondents forfeited their acquired right to operate the nightclub. With respect, I believe such a result would tilt the balance too far in favour of the municipality. I agree with the conclusion of the unanimous Quebec Court of Appeal and would dismiss the appeal.\nI. The Issue # The facts and applicable enactments are outlined in my colleague’s reasons for judgment. I fully agree with his rejection of the “categorical” approach. This is the theory under which an owner, whose use of land does not conform to a new by-law, nevertheless has an “acquired right” to expand, alter or modify an existing use to include anything and everything permitted on that land under the “use category” defined in the prior law (if indeed there was a prior law). While the “categorical” approach may produce a fair result on the facts of this case, it does so only because the categories of use created by the prior by-law were quite narrow […]\nHowever, as my colleague Gonthier J. demonstrates, the “categorical” approach is wrong in principle and will often deliver a result that unduly favours individual landowners at the expense of the community interest. The protected “acquired right” properly relates only to the status quo. It does not protect a potential or contemplated use that has never materialized. A similar rule prevails in the common law provinces: see Heutinck v. Oakland (Township) (1997), 42 M.P.L.R. (2d) 258 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 6:\nCentral to this analysis is our reliance upon the well established rule that the nature of a non-conforming use is not defined by reference to definitions in the by-law. Rather, it must be determined by reference to the use to which the property was put at the time the by-law was passed.\nTo the same effect, see: Vancouver (City) v. Victoria Block Ltd. (1964), 45 D.L.R. (2d) 118 (B.C. C.A.), at p. 121; Glenelg (Township) v. Davis (1992), 10 M.P.L.R. (2d) 260 (Ont. C.A.); Nanaimo (City) v. Brickyard Enterprises Ltd., [1993] B.C.J. No. 992 (B.C. S.C.), at para. 20. The acquired right is no more than a right to carry on using the land for the purpose to which it was in fact previously being put. The issue, of course, is how widely or narrowly to circumscribe the description of the purpose of that “pre-existing use”.\nII. The Pre-Existing Use # As stated, the premises in question here have been used as a nightclub (or “cabaret”) for many years. Such use is no longer permitted in the relevant zone under the revised provisions. Choice of a broad definition (”nightclub”) or a narrow definition (”country and western nightclub”) of the pre-existing use will largely determine the outcome of the appeal.\nThe necessity of making a careful choice of definition requires us to look realistically at the business being conducted on the premises prior to the new zoning by-law. Nightclubs or “cabarets” constitute a fickle industry. They rise and fall on swings of popularity. Their operators are forever in search of a “winning formula”. Location, we are told, is basic, but beyond that the elements of food, drink, ambiance and entertainment are endlessly varied to generate customer interest. A few years ago, customers may have flocked to hear western singers accompanied by steak and potatoes. Some still do. Irish pubs usually offer Irish melodies, but may have to be transformed next season into a different ambiance offering Karaoke. Last year’s successful disco may give way to this year’s Texas line dancers. Land used for these purposes serves merely as a platform for a business offering a marketable mix of food, drink and lawful entertainment to the public.\nThe appellant takes the position that substitution of nude dancers for western singers is such an extreme variation in the nightclub or cabaret formula as to constitute a wholly different use. I do not agree. It is open to the municipality as a legislator to introduce such value judgments into its land use controls (as it did here under the new by-law), but I do not think the landowner’s “acquired right” to continue to carry on business can retroactively be truncated in this way on the present state of the law.\nIII. The Role of Zoning # Private law has long protected adjoining owners in the enjoyment of the amenities of their land. Article 947 of the Civil Code of Quebec, S.Q. 1991, c. 64, protects that enjoyment, as does the tort of nuisance at common law. Thus neighbours obtained an injunction in nuisance against a tobacco factory that emitted “noxious odours” in Appleby v. Erie Tobacco Co. (1910), 22 O.L.R. 533 (Ont. C.A.), and on the same basis successfully opposed the establishment of a dog hospital in a residential area in Macievich v. Anderson, [1952] 4 D.L.R. 507 (Man. C.A.). The doctrine of Rylands v. Fletcher (1868), L.R. 3 H.L. 330 (U.K. H.L.), imposes virtually absolute liability on owners who bring on their land “anything likely to do mischief if it escapes” and causes damage to a neighbour, unless the escape was due to the neighbour’s default (pp. 339-40). These private law remedies were designed, in a general sense, to protect neighbourhood amenities.\nThe objectives of modern zoning were also accomplished to some extent by private arrangement using restrictive covenants as in Daly v. Vancouver (City) (1956), 5 D.L.R. (2d) 474 (B.C. S.C.), and building schemes as in Lorne Park, Re (1913), 30 O.L.R. 289 (Ont. C.A.). These earlier developments in the law are noted in Boykiw v. Calgary (City) Development Appeal Board (1992), 90 D.L.R. (4th) 558 (Alta. C.A.), at p. 563, and described in some detail in J. B. Milner, Community Planning (1963), at p. 357 et seq. Initially, local government occupied itself with noxious uses, and established building standards in the interest of fire prevention and safety.\nThe objection to more sophisticated land use controls, when they emerged as an instrument of good government, was that they were to some extent confiscatory of the owner’s rights: see Dinnick v. Toronto (City) Architect (1913), 28 O.L.R. 52 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 58, Regina Auto Court v. Regina (City) (1958), 25 W.W.R. 167 (Sask. Q.B.), at pp. 168-69; and Canadian Occidental Petroleum Ltd. v. North Vancouver (District) (1983), 148 D.L.R. (3d) 255 (B.C. S.C.), at p. 269.\nTo counter the concern about confiscation without compensation, lawful existing uses came to be protected under the concept of “acquired rights” both under the Civil Code in Quebec, and by judicial interpretation in the common law provinces: Toronto (City) v. Wheeler (1912), 4 D.L.R. 352 (Ont. H.C.), per Middleton J., at p. 353:\n[I]t is, I think, a sound principle that the Legislature could not have contemplated an interference with vested rights, unless the language used clearly required some other construction to be given to the enactment.\nSee also R. v. Howard (1884), 4 O.R. 377 (Ont. H.C.), at p. 381, and R. v. Clark Brothers \u0026amp; Hughes Ltd. (1924), [1925] 1 D.L.R. 49 (Man. C.A.), at pp. 51 and 53.\nIt is against that background that the modern regime of land use controls, with their inherent tension between the owner’s interest in putting its own property to what it regards as the optimal use and the municipality’s interest in having all of the land within its boundaries organized in a plan which it thinks will maximize the benefits and amenities for all inhabitants, should be interpreted.\nIV. The Applicable Legislation # An Act Respecting Land Use Planning and Development, R.S.Q., A -19.1, authorizes Quebec municipalities to regulate the use of land by dividing their territories into zones to which are allocated various groups and classes of uses. This is to be done: [translation] “based on common characteristics of land occupation relating to volume, nuisance, compatibility, use and aesthetics”. The impact of a particular land use on neighbouring lands is clearly a key concern, which is shared by common law jurisdictions. The loss of amenities by noise and air pollution, increased traffic, increased demands on municipal services, or other disruptions, may conveniently be referred to as “neighbourhood effects”. The minimization of such adverse effects on surrounding owners or the community as a whole is one of the principal objectives of zoning controls.\nWith respect to acquired rights (or legal non-conforming uses), s. 113(18) of the provincial Act allows Quebec municipalities to regulate them, prevent their substitution by other non-conforming uses, and to prohibit their extension and alteration. The municipality may not, however, order the cessation of such uses unless they have been abandoned or interrupted for “a reasonable period” no shorter than six months. In other words, the provincial legislation not only respects the doctrine of acquired rights, but makes it clear that municipalities must do so as well.\nHere the municipality did not purport to prohibit the alteration (or “modification”) of acquired rights, although it was empowered to legislate in that regard under s. 113(18)(c) of the provincial Act. Nor, as the Court of Appeal pointed out, did it purport to suppress nude dance bars under the Cities and Towns Act, R.S.Q., c. C-19, whether under s. 414 (”decency and good morals”) or s. 410 (”general welfare in the territory of the municipality”). We therefore do not need to decide whether such a prohibition would have been valid or effective under the existing law.\nExercising its statutory powers of delegated legislation, the City of Saint-Romuald did enact zoning by-law 273-90, which came into force on May 22, 1991. The appellant places weight on s. 9 of the by-law which provides:\nPermitted Uses The uses listed in the specification grid correspond to the description of uses set out in chapter IV. A line appearing opposite a class of uses means that all principal uses in that class are permitted, to the exclusion of all other uses. [Gonthier J.’s emphasis.]\nIn the appellant’s submission, the underlined words constitute a specific prohibition of the respondents non-conforming use. Read in that way, of course, it is a prohibition of all non-conforming uses, and if applied in derogation of acquired rights would serve to nullify them. On this point, I prefer the view taken by the Quebec Court of Appeal that the general language of s. 9 is not sufficient to constitute an express prohibition sufficient to overcome the respondents acquired rights.\nV. Scope of the “Acquired Right” # Under the doctrine of “acquired rights”, the respondents were not only entitled to continue to use the premises as they were when the new by-law was passed, but was given some flexibility in the operation of that use. My colleague Gonthier J. notes that regard is to be had in such cases to “the real and reasonable expectations” of the landowner caught by changes in the zoning (para. 63). Gonthier J. also acknowledges (para. 62) that “normal evolution” may occur in some uses with the passage of time, and that “a use protected by acquired rights may be exercised more intensively (Anjou (Ville) c. Vanier (March 8, 1983), Doc. C.A. Montréal 500-09-001305-788 (C.A. Que.), J.E. 83-325; Huot c. L’Ange-Gardien (Municipalité), [1992] R.J.Q. 2404 (C.A. Que.); Soudure mobile D. Pilon Inc. c. Larose, [1990] R.L. 93 (C.A. Que.)) and adapt to the demands of the market or the technology that are relevant to it (Cie 1846-0832 Québec Inc. c. Ste-Jean-Chrysostome (Ville), [1994] R.J.Q. 618 (C.A. Que.)), at p. 624, Tourigny J.A. dissenting”. In my view, that is what happened here.\nSimilar flexibility also exists at common law. Thus in Toronto (City) v. Central Jewish Institute, [1948] S.C.R. 101 (S.C.C.), a legal non-conforming use (private school) previously carried on only in part of the building was lawfully extended throughout the entire building, per Kellock J., at p. 114:\nI do not think that the use made of the premises by the appellant after the school term recommenced in September was for a different purpose within the meaning of the statute from the use being made of them on July 24th. [Emphasis added.]\nAt this point, a distinction should be drawn between the type of legal non-conforming use and the intensity of such use. A legal non-conforming nursing home, for example, may want to double its 15 beds. The type of use would remain the same, but the intensity of that use would be substantially increased.\nA. Intensity of Use # The respondents nightclub has substantially increased its business since switching from cowboy singers to nude dancers. There are more customers. More cars. More noise. Assuming for the moment that the “type” of use has not changed, is this increased intensity of use a basis for objection?\nIn Central Jewish Institute, supra, this Court concluded that so long as the type of use was continued (private school facilities), the owner was not limited to the then existing intensity (at the relevant time only the kitchen and a ground floor room of the building were used for school purposes). Rather, the appellant was entitled to expand the non-conforming use throughout its building. To some extent, the Court’s treatment of intensity of use was tied to the specific text of the provincial Act (which extended the immunity to the building itself), but the case has subsequently been applied more generally (I think correctly) to sanction increases in intensity of use so long as the same type of use is continued. My colleague, Gonthier J., has referred to the Quebec authorities. A similar principle operates in the common law provinces: see Canadian Occidental Petroleum, supra, at p. 268 (expanded manufacture of hazardous substances); O’Sullivan Funeral Home Ltd. v. Sault Ste. Marie (City), [1961] O.R. 413 (Ont. H.C.) (infrequent use of a funeral parlour no bar to expanded activity); Kiss v. Phil Dennis Enterprises Ltd. (1974), 46 D.L.R. (3d) 196 (Ont. H.C.) (where, at p. 202, the court noted approvingly that “the proposed change is one of degree, and not of kind of use”); Perth (Town) v. Perth Mews Ltd. (1991), 7 M.P.L.R. (2d) 259 (Ont. Gen. Div.) (the legal non-conforming right to use pinball machines in one part of the building was extended to all of it); Magdalena’s Rest Home Ltd. v. Etobicoke (City) (1992), 12 M.P.L.R. (2d) 316 (Ont. Gen. Div.) (rest home expanded from 15 to 17 beds); Moncton (City) v. Como (1990), 103 N.B.R. (2d) 286 (N.B. Q.B.) (expansion of existing equipment storage and repair business); Borins v. Toronto (City) (1988), 50 R.P.R. 43 (Ont. Dist. Ct.) (conversion of office space); 382671 Ontario Ltd. v. London (City) Chief Building Official (1996), 32 M.P.L.R. (2d) 1 (Ont. Gen. Div.) (addition of a unit in an apartment building).\nThere are, however, some limitations at the outer boundaries of increasing the intensity of use. This appears from the decision of Cory J.A. (as he then was) in R. v. Grant (1983), 23 M.P.L.R. 89 (Ont. C.A.), where the court refused to allow a legal non-conforming two-unit apartment building to be further subdivided into four units. While the precise result may to some extent conflict with this Court’s decision in Central Jewish Institute, supra (which was not cited by Cory J.A.), even Central Jewish Institute proceeded on the basis that the expansion of school activity would be reasonable and limited — in that particular case limited to the existing building.\nIn general, merely continuing the precise pre-existing activity, even at an intensified level, is clearly protected, but the intensification may be of such a degree as to create a difference in kind. A family farm which has a few pigs on the fringe of a town may continue as a legal non-conforming use, but the result may be otherwise if it is sought to expand its pork operation into “factory in the country” type intensive pig farming. While in one sense the “use” has continued, in another sense its character has been so altered as to become, in terms of its impact on the community, an altogether different use.\nIn the more usual type of situation, a non-conforming commercial use in a residential neighbourhood that enjoys increasing business should not ordinarily be penalized for its success by losing its “acquired right” to operate, even if a by-product of that success is some increased traffic and noise.\nThe analogous U.S. principle is succinctly stated in McQuillin, The Law of Municipal Corporations (3rd ed. 1976), vol. 8A, at p. 126:\nThe distinction is between an increase in the amount of business, even a great increase, which does not work a change in use, and an enlargement of a non-conforming business so as to be different in kind in its effect on the neighbourhood. [Emphasis added.]\nThis is a high threshold which it is unnecessary to explore on this appeal. Based on the evidence here, no valid objection could be taken to the respondents’ nightclub based on increased intensity of use.\nB. Type of Use # The appellant argues that a nightclub offering western music is a different type of use than a nightclub presenting nude dancers. This is the real battleground between the appellant and the respondents.\nA “use” may include a number of activities. A nightclub, as stated, serves food and drink and provides entertainment. The question here is how many of these activities, and of what nature, can be added, subtracted or modified before it can no longer be called the same “type” of use?\nIn R. v. Cappy (1952), 103 C.C.C. 25 (Ont. C.A.), Oakwood Stadium in Toronto, a general venue for sports activities, was modified to accommodate stock car racing. The neighbours complained about the increased noise and disruption. The municipality launched a by-law prosecution. The stadium owners defended on the basis of a legal non-conforming use. The majority of the Court of Appeal, per Laidlaw J.A., acquitted the stadium owners on the basis that they operated a “general purpose” stadium whose permissible program (which presumably accorded with the owners’ “real and natural expectation”) was not limited to the type of specific events on “the day of the passing of the by-law” but included “public exhibitions and performances of all kinds” (p. 33). The dissenting judge concluded that the pre-existing use had been limited to certain types of exhibitions and performances, and stock car racing was obviously not included because the owners had been required to undertake a “substantial expenditure of money and complete reconstruction of the facilities so as to enable motor-racing to be carried on” (p. 29). The interesting question is why the majority took a broad view of the existing use and the dissent took a narrow view. Both of these views were sustainable on the facts. The majority seemed influenced by the idea of remoteness, i.e., that the new activity, while different, was not remote but was closely related to what had gone before. Although “neighbourhood effects” were not mentioned by the dissenting judge, I think it fair to say that if the facts were reversed so that the stadium had been reconstructed to eliminate stock car racing in favour of less noisy exhibitions such as walk-a-thons or lawn tennis, the neighbours (and the dissenting judge) might have taken a more expansive view of the pre-existing use.\nThe more recent common law jurisprudence on “non-conforming uses” is no less divided than the Quebec jurisprudence on “acquired rights”: see I.T. Kagan, But I Do Not Want to Be Legal (1993) 13 M.P.L.R. (2d) 252. The more restricted end of the definitional spectrum is illustrated by R. v. Kelly Landscape Contractors Ltd. (1980), 13 M.P.L.R. 67 (Ont. Co. Ct.), where it was held that a legal non-conforming business which grew flowers for sale could not lawfully sell the flowers (or fertilizers, etc.) from its premises. The added business, while closely related, was not the same.\nThe more generous end of the definitional spectrum is illustrated by Campbellton (City) v. Thompson (1994), 151 N.B.R. (2d) 1 (N.B. C.A.), where a landowner was permitted to add a rock-crusher to its existing non-conforming quarry operation. The trial judge had concluded that crushing rock was a different activity than extraction, and upheld the municipality’s objection. This was reversed by the Court of Appeal which applied its previous decision in Lordon v. Pitman (1980), 33 N.B.R. (2d) 23 (N.B. C.A.), in asking itself whether the introduction of the “new element” changed “the essential general use of the land” (para. 10). The added activity, it decided, did not do so. Again, the trial judge’s narrower view of the pre-existing use (extraction and sale of rock) was as open on the facts as the broader view taken by the Court of Appeal (a quarry operation includes an activity reasonably incidental thereto). The trial judge was worried about the neighbourhood effects of the added activity. The Court of Appeal seems to have decided the case on considerations of remoteness.\nIn my view, both remoteness and neighbourhood effects have a role to play in the proper disposition of this type of case. Each contributes to what Gonthier J. refers to a the real and natural expectation of the landowner. The Court’s objective is to maintain a fair balance between the individual landowner’s interest and the community’s interest. The landowner overreaches itself if (i) the scale or intensity of the activity can be said to bring about a change in the type of use, as mentioned above, or if (ii) the addition of new activities or the modification of old activities, (albeit within the same general land use purpose), is seen by the Court as too remote from the earlier activities to be entitled to protection, or if (iii) the new or modified activities can be shown to create undue additional or aggravated problems for the municipality, the local authorities, or the neighbours, as compared with what went before. The factors are balanced against one another. Thus, adding a metal panel beating operation to an automobile repair shop in a residential neighbourhood will probably (despite the logical business affinity) be characterized as a new type of use, whereas a local non-conforming grocer store use that adds an innocuous fax machine — clearly an activity unrelated to selling groceries — will likely succeed (assuming someone wished to challenge it) by defining its prior operation as a “convenience store” rather than a “grocery store”.\nThe relevance of remoteness is self-explanatory, but the relevance of neighbourhood effects perhaps requires some discussion. The balancing of interests takes place in the framework of zoning control. The Quebec law, as mentioned, expressly takes neighbourhood effects into account in the legislative establishment of use categories. The by-law in this particular case speaks of “volume, nuisance, compatibility, use and aesthetics”, and see 2550-9613 Québec Inc. c. Val d’Or (Ville), [1997] R.J.Q. 2090 (C.A. Que.). It stands to reason that in attempting to accommodate the landowner’s real and natural expectation of the continuation of the status quo, and to properly maintain the balance between the interests of the landowner and the community, the Court should also have these “neighbourhood effects” in mind in considering the situation of a landowner who has somewhat modified or extended pre-existing activities within the same general use category. The adverse impact of neighbourhood effects generated by added or modified activities constitutes one of the guiding principles under the somewhat different regulatory systems in Britain (see, for example, East Barnet Urban District Council v. British Transport Commission (1961), [1962] 2 Q.B. 484 (Eng. Q.B.), and Thames Heliport Plc v. London Borough of Tower Hamlets (1996), 74 P. \u0026amp; C.R. 164 (Eng. C.A.), and in the United States (see Bridgewater (Town) v. Chukran, 217 N.E.2d 726 (U.S. Mass. 1966), at pp. 727-28, Conforti v. Manchester (City), 677 A.2d 147 (U.S. N.H. 1996), at p. 150, Belleville (Town) v. Parrillo’s Inc., 416 A.2d 388 (U.S. N.J. 1980), and Cape Resort Hotels Inc. v. Alcoholic Licensing Bd. of Falmouth, 431 N.E.2d 213 (U.S. Mass. 1982), at p. 217). In those jurisdictions, as in Canada, planning is concerned not only with the physical use of land but also with any adverse effects of such uses on the surrounding area. It is appropriate to carry that concern forward into the Court’s consideration of added, altered or modified activities which are claimed to be protected by the prior existing use.\n[…]\nA concern for the twin criteria of remoteness and neighbourhood effects is also, I think, implicit in Prince Edward Island Museum \u0026amp; Heritage Foundation v. Charlottetown (City) (1998), 161 Nfld. \u0026amp; P.E.I.R. 56 (P.E.I. T.D.). A museum and heritage foundation had for many years used its parcel of land, which included several buildings, for museum-related activities. In 1979, its operation became a legal non-conforming use. Subsequently, the owners began to expand the activities in one of the buildings (”the Carriage House”) to include receptions and dinners catered by a local hotel. Some of these soirées were for fundraising purposes. The neighbours objected to the added noise and commotion. Notwithstanding the owner’s ingenious efforts to tie its hospitality activities to museum functions (e.g., it argued it would “make heritage more palatable by concealing it in another activity such as a concert” (para. 15)), DesRoches J. concluded that the hospitality functions were too remote from the prior non-conforming use to be permitted.\nAt the same time, though, he permitted other added or altered museum activities, including a gift shop, a genealogy centre for research and facilities for public lectures. Although the rationale is not articulated in his reasons, it is apparent that the activities he upheld created fewer adverse neighbourhood effects than those he found to be prohibited, and were, indeed, not the subject of public complaint.\nC. Summary of Approach # I therefore approach the issue of limitations on the respondents’ acquired right as follows:\nIt is firstly necessary to characterize the purpose of the pre-existing use (Central Jewish Institute, supra). The purpose for which the premises were used (i.e., “the use”) is a function of the activities actually carried on at the site prior to the new by-law restrictions.\nWhere the current use is merely an intensification of the pre-existing activity, it will rarely be open to objection. However, where the intensification is such as to go beyond a matter of degree and constitutes, in terms of community impact, a difference in kind (as in the hypothetical case of the pig farm discussed above), the protection may be lost.\nTo the extent a landowner expands its activities beyond those it engaged in before (as where a custom picture-framing shop attempted to add a landscaping business in Nepean (City) v. D’Angelo (1998), 49 M.P.L.R. (2d) 243 (Ont. Gen. Div.), the added activities may be held to be too remote from the earlier activities to be protected under the non-conforming use. In such a case, the added activities are simply outside any fair definition of the pre-existing use and it is unnecessary to evaluate “neighbourhood effects”.\nTo the extent activities are added, altered or modified within the scope of the original purpose (i.e., activities that are ancillary to, or closely related to, the pre-existing activities), the Court has to balance the landowner’s interest against the community interest, taking into account the nature of the pre-existing use (e.g., the degree to which it clashes with surrounding land uses), the degree of remoteness (the closer to the original activity, the more unassailable the acquired right) and the new or aggravated neighbourhood effects (e.g., the addition of a rock crusher in a residential neighbourhood is likely to be more disruptive than the addition of a fax machine). The greater the disruption, the more tightly drawn will be the definition of the pre-existing use or acquired right. This approach does not rob the landowner of an entitlement. By definition, the limitation applies only to added, altered or modified activities.\nNeighbourhood effects, unless obvious, should not be assumed but should be established by evidence if they are to be relied upon.\nThe resulting characterization of the acquired right (or legal non-conforming use) should not be so general as to liberate the owner from the constraints of what he actually did, and not be so narrow as to rob him of some flexibility in the reasonable evolution of prior activities. The degree of this flexibility may vary with the type of use. Here, for example, the pre-existing use is a nightclub business which in its nature requires renewal and change. That change, within reasonable limits, should be accommodated.\nWhile the definition of the acquired right will always have an element of subjective judgment, the criteria mentioned above constitute an attempt to ground the Court’s decision in the objective facts. The outcome of the characterization analysis should not turn on personal value judgments, such as whether nude dancing is more or less deplorable than cowboy singing. I am unable, with respect, to accept as legally relevant my colleague’s observation that “[w]hereas erotic entertainment seeks to sexually arouse the audience by the stripping and suggestive behaviour engaged in by the performers, country and western shows seek to entertain by providing a showcase for the special talents of singers, musicians and dancers” (para. 76). Serious music is also commonly thought to arouse the passions profoundly, but in terms of acquired rights, music stores should not be differentiated by whether they offer Muzak or Mozart.\nVI. Application to the Facts # As stated earlier, I believe the respondents’ pre-existing use can appropriately be characterized as the commercial offering of a combination of food, drink, ambiance and lawful entertainment to the public.\nThe switch to a different form of entertainment, as in the change from western-style concerts to nude dancers, is within this general nightclub purpose. The substitution of nude dancers is no more remote in law than would be the substitution of karaoke singing. My colleague Gonthier J. takes the view that nude dancing raises “considerations of a moral nature” (para. 77) that presumably would not be raised by karaoke singing, but in my view, with respect, it is not our function to create a moral hierarchy of different forms of entertainment. Objectively speaking, there is no problem of remoteness. There is no replacement of one use by a different use.\nWhile it appears that the substitution of nude dancing has improved the business, the municipality does not rely on an intensification of the existing use as a disqualification.\nThere is no serious evidence of adverse neighbourhood effects. My colleague Gonthier J. relies on the comment of Constable Gelly about increased police surveillance, but the municipality made no effort to demonstrate a link between criminal elements and nude dancing. The police themselves did not make much of a point of added surveillance and the trial judge went out of his way to say that there was no problem of discipline within the premises. In my view, if the appellant’s case were to rest on adverse neighbourhood effects, a better evidentiary base ought to have been provided.\nIn terms of “added” activities, my colleague Gonthier J. points out that the respondents created five private viewing booths in which a customer and the dancer were distanced from the general audience. This, he points out, is a form of private entertainment. The uncontradicted evidence, however, was that there was no sexual touching and that nothing occurred in the booth that did not occur in the general viewing area. Admission to the booths was open to any member of the public. Morality apart, I do not see how this changes the legal nature of the use, any more than would be the case if an ordinary restaurant sought to upgrade its facilities by offering private dining-rooms\nVII. Conclusion # In my view, the change in entertainment offered by the respondents did not constitute the illegal replacement of the original non-conforming use with a different and therefore unprotected non-conforming use.\nIf nude dancing is thought to be objectionable on moral or other grounds, the topic could be further considered by legislators rather than by judicial curtailment of acquired rights.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondents.\nGonthier J. (dissenting) — # I. Introduction # This appeal deals primarily with the extent of the protection conferred by acquired rights in Quebec municipal law. The issue to be determined is the limits of the protection where the use initially exercised has been transformed. Specifically, the Court must decide in the instant case whether acquired rights continue to exist when a bar that had been presenting country and western entertainment subsequently becomes a bar that presents erotic entertainment.\nII. Facts # The respondents Claudette Olivier, Louise Bolduc and Roger Bolduc are owners of a building located within the territory of the appellant City of Saint-Romuald. Since 1990, several tenants in succession have operated a bar in the building, presenting country and western entertainment. At the time, the City’s zoning by-law (C-600) permitted the operation of [translation] “cabarets” in the zone where the building is located. However, a new zoning by-law, No. 273-90, came into force on May 22, 1991. Like a number of other by-laws of its type, it sets out the authorized and prohibited uses for a given zone, using a grid known as the [translation]”specifications grid” (s. 7). Different uses are first divided into “groups” and then into “classes”. Uses are allocated to the various classes [translation] “based on common characteristics of land occupation relating to volume, nuisance, compatibility, use and aesthetics” (s. 16). This type of classification enables the City to authorize or to prohibit an entire class of uses or a specific use, at its option. To this end, ss. 9 to 11 of the by-law state:\n[TRANSLATION]\nPermitted Uses The uses listed in the specifications grid correspond to the description of uses set out in chapter IV. A line appearing opposite a class of uses means that all principal uses in that class are permitted, to the exclusion of all other uses. [Emphasis added.]\nOther Permitted Use Where a principal use is specifically permitted, this means that even if the class corresponding to that use is not permitted, that particular use is permitted.\nProhibited Use Where a principal use is specifically prohibited, this means that even if the class corresponding to that use is authorized, that particular use is prohibited.\nIn the new by-law, uses [translation] “restaurant or bar with entertainment” (585) and [translation] “restaurant or bar with erotic entertainment or films” (586) — which correspond to the former use “cabaret” — are in the [translation] “commercial services” class (s. 22). For the zone in which the building is located, there is no line opposite “commercial services” on the specifications grid. Moreover, uses 585 and 586 are not shown on the grid as expressly permitted. Although use [translation] “hotel, motel, guest house” (181) is also part of the “commercial services” class, it is shown on the grid as expressly prohibited. The new by-law also governs the issue of acquired rights, in part. It specifically provides, inter alia, that a non-conforming use protected by acquired rights may not be replaced by another non-conforming use (s. 204).\nIn the fall of 1994, after buying out the business from the owner of the country and western bar, the respondent 9010-4407 Québec Inc. began operating a bar which presented entertainment involving nude dancers. The appellant then decided to apply to the Superior Court under s. 227 of the Act respecting land use planning and development, R.S.Q., c. A-19.1, for an order requiring the cessation of what it regarded as the unlawful replacement of one non-conforming use by another.\n[…]\nVI. Analysis # [\u0026hellip;]\nB. Replacement of Use # As indicated above, a change in the nature of the use actually made prior to the zoning amendment will result in loss of the immunity conferred by acquired rights. Whether such a change has occurred must be determined on the basis of the real and natural expectations of the user and the relevance of the changes as regards the purposes of land use by-laws. Nevertheless, each case turns on its own facts and the nature of the use protected by acquired rights must be determined by the court having regard to the unique facts of each situation.\nIn the instant case, a country and western bar was replaced by a bar that presented erotic entertainment. The respondents contend that the building has never housed anything but a bar with entertainment and that the nature of the entertainment provided should not have any effect on acquired rights. With respect, I am unable to agree with that assertion. First, I do not believe that the real and natural expectations of the owner of a country and western bar include operating a bar with nude dancers. There is a significant prima facie difference in the nature of the entertainment being presented. Whereas erotic entertainment seeks to sexually arouse the audience by the stripping and suggestive behaviour engaged in by the performers, country and western shows seek to entertain by providing a showcase for the special talents of singers, musicians or dancers. That difference is further apparent in some of the physical alterations made to the building and the business it houses because of the transformation from a country and western bar to a bar with nude dancers. Among other things, five closed booths were added so that customers could be offered erotic dances in a private setting. I further find it relevant to note the contrast between private dances performed in booths and country and western entertainment presented in public. In my view, these factors provide further support for the impression that one use has indeed been replaced by another, rather than that the same use has been continued.\nThe foregoing exercise therefore plainly leads me to finding that there is an obvious difference between a bar that presents country and western entertainment and a bar that presents erotic entertainment, even if we disregard individual opinion about the moral value of erotic entertainment. However, that distinction becomes even more germane when we examine it with the objectives of harmonious development and welfare, which land use legislation is intended to advance, in mind. Efforts to advance those objectives may indeed be informed by considerations of a moral nature, as long as those considerations relate to the primary purposes of the by-laws. For example, it would obviously be proper, for the purposes of those by-laws, to distinguish between establishments that serve liquor and establishments that do not. A fortiori, it should be apparent that there is a fundamental difference between an establishment that presents country and western entertainment and another establishment that presents entertainment of an erotic nature. As well, the observation that both types of entertainment are legal does nothing to advance the analysis, since by definition, land use planning presupposes a classification of legal uses for the purposes of dividing and organizing the territory.\nNonetheless, the nature of an activity must be defined in reference to the perception and values of the society. Accordingly, while it may be legal to operate establishments that present erotic entertainment, those establishments have a particular social and moral connotation that justifies treating them as distinct for land use planning purposes. First, the kind of entertainment presented involves an increased possibility of indecent excesses and illegal acts (see, for example, s. 163(2)(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46: exhibiting an indecent show; s. 167: immoral theatrical performance; and s. 173(1): indecent act). Second, that kind of entertainment tends to condone the violation of respect for and the dignity of the performers, whose sexuality and persons are then subservient to and exploited for lewd and commercial purposes. And third, it is worth noting that the police officer, Gelly, testified at trial that the opening of an establishment presenting erotic entertainment prompted the police service to tighten its surveillance in the surrounding neighbourhood, and that it was attracting a criminal element.\nThe decisive question of whether the conversion of an establishment that presents entertainment that is devoid of any sexual or erotic aspect into an establishment that presents erotic entertainment means that the protection offered by acquired rights is lost has only seldom been addressed by the courts. In Quebec, there is only Saint-Raymond (Ville) c. Enterprises Benoît Demers Inc., [1996] Q.J. No. 4387 (C.S. Que.), in which Goodwin J. held that a transformation of this sort had resulted in replacement of one prohibited use by another, and led to the loss of the acquired rights. The courts of the other provinces of Canada do not seem to have had occasion to deal specifically with this question. The American courts, however, have examined it on a few occasions.\nIn Squillante v. Zoning Board of Appeals of the City of Hartford (September 26, 1997), Doc. CV 960566513s (U.S. Conn.), the plaintiffs had obtained a certificate of occupancy from the municipality to operate a “café liquor” (p. 2). At the time the certificate was issued, it would have been open to them to present “adult” entertainment under the by-laws then in force. However, there was nothing in the evidence to show that they had done any such thing. The city then amended its zoning by-laws, and “adult” entertainment establishments were prohibited in the zone where the plaintiffs’ business was located. The plaintiffs subsequently began to operate an establishment of that nature. The city had issued a notice of violation to the plaintiffs, who then claimed that their activities were protected by acquired rights. The Court rejected that argument, stating, at pp. 12-13:\n[T]he simple fact is that the record reflects that no adult entertainment was actually being provided on the premises prior to the time the municipal code was amended on May 9, 1994, to exclude adult entertainment from a B-1 zone.\nAccordingly, because a “café liquor” and an adult entertainment establishment are entirely different in nature, operation of the former could not mean that operation of the latter was protected by acquired rights.\nIn Marzocco v. City of Albany (1995), 629 N.Y.S.2d 847 (U.S. N.Y.A.D. 3rd Dept.), the petitioner had purchased a tavern featuring male strippers as entertainment, which catered primarily to the area gay population. That use was prohibited by the zoning by-laws in force, but was protected by acquired rights. The petitioner first replaced the male strippers with topless female dancers. He then decided to surrender his liquor licence and establish a “juice bar”, and present totally nude female dancers and other forms of erotic entertainment. He therefore applied to the City of Albany Board of Building, Zoning and Housing Appeals for permission to change the use of the premises. When the request was denied, he turned to the courts, which affirmed the Board’s decision. The Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court held, at p. 848:\nInitially, we agree with Supreme Court that there is rational basis and substantial evidence in the record to support respondent’s factual determination that petitioner’s change in the character of his property was sufficient to require a use variance. \u0026hellip; Notably, the abandonment of petitioner’s tavern trade and surrender of his liquor licence freed him from the restrictions (and the public from the protections) of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law and the rules of the State Liquor Authority. In the same connection, the primary purpose and profit motive of the business changed from the sale of food and beverages, with adult entertainment a mere incidental attraction, to the exhibition of nude dancing, thereby effecting a fundamental change in the character of the clientele and, as a consequence, the impact of the business on the neighborhood. [Emphasis added.]\nThe dissimilarity between a country and western bar and a bar that presents entertainment involving nude dancers is also revealed by a line of more general cases concerning the validity of land use planning provisions governing establishments that present erotic entertainment. In 2550-9613 Québec Inc. c. Val d’Or (Ville), [1997] R.J.Q. 2090 (C.A. Que.), it was argued that the distinction made by the municipality between [translation] “taverns, bars and night clubs” and establishments that present entertainment with male and female nude dancers was discriminatory, as that term is understood in administrative law. Chamberland J.A., writing for the Court of Appeal, rejected that argument and stated in his reasons, at p. 2095:\n[TRANSLATION]\nIt is clear from the evidence in this case that the adoption of the zoning by-law (June 7, 1993) and the decision to refuse the [respondent’s] request to amend the by-law (July 17, 1995) were based on considerations involving the proximity of a church and an elementary school, child protection, crime prevention and the safety and welfare of the public, as well as the improvement of the image of downtown Val-d’Or. These are relevant considerations in zoning and urban planning matters.\nThe distinction was therefore held to be permitted under the Act respecting land use planning and development. As well, in Moncton (City) v. Steldon Enterprises Ltd. (2000), 225 N.B.R. (2d) 11 (N.B. Q.B.), it was concluded that a by-law adopted under the Community Planning Act, R.S.N.B. 1973, c. C-12, prohibiting the operation of “adult cabarets” within the city, was valid. Those cases are also consistent with the opinion stated by the United States Supreme Court regarding the validity of similar zoning ordinances (Young v. American Mini Theatres Inc. (1976), 427 U.S. 50 (U.S. Sup. Ct.); City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres Inc. (1986), 475 U.S. 41 (U.S. Sup. Ct.)).\nAs a final point, I consider it worth noting that in Ontario, the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, specifically delegates to municipalities the power to regulate “adult entertainment parlours” (see, for example, 538745 Ontario Inc. v. Windsor (City) (1988), 64 O.R. (2d) 38 (Ont. C.A.)). Section 225 of that Act provides:\n(1) By-laws may be passed by the councils of local municipalities for licensing, regulating, governing, classifying and inspecting adult entertainment parlours or any class or classes thereof and for revoking or suspending any such licence and for limiting the number of such licences to be granted, in accordance with subsection (3).\n…\n(3) Despite subsection 257.2 (4), a by-law passed under this section may define the area or areas of the municipality in which adult entertainment parlours or any class or classes thereof may or may not operate and may limit the number of licences to be granted in respect of adult entertainment parlours or any class or classes thereof in any such area or areas in which they are permitted.\nTo conclude, I believe that these are significant indications that the distinction between a bar that presents country and western entertainment and a bar that presents entertainment involving nude dancers is relevant in the exercise of general land use planning powers.\nI am of the view therefore that operating a bar that presents erotic entertainment constitutes the illegal replacement of the original non-confirming use by a different non-conforming use. Replacing the one with the other accordingly results in loss of the protection conferred by acquired rights.\nVII. Conclusion # For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and order the respondents to immediately cease using the premises located at 643 4th Avenue in Saint-Romuald as a bar that presents erotic entertainment, with costs throughout.\n"},{"id":169,"href":"/casebook/shelter/intro-section7/","title":"Section 7 and the Evolving Right to Shelter","section":"Chapter 4","content":"In our discussion of acquired rights and the problem of regulating short-term rentals last week, we touched on the idea that a central issue for the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) and other municipal governments in Canada is access to affordable housing. There is growing awareness that Halifax is facing a crisis in housing affordability and a dramatic rise in the number of people who experience chronic homelessness.\nAddressing homelessness and access to housing engages a complex set of legal and policy issues, actors and decision-making networks. One aspect of this context in which Canadian courts have been especially active is the constitutional right of homeless persons to access and shelter in public spaces—namely, municipal parks—in order to meet their immediate needs. As the problem below describes, the role of these rights and challenges to their realization gained national attention in Halifax in summer 2021, after a series of forced evictions of people living in temporary and emergency shelters on municipal lands.\nOur goal this week is to explore how rights to access public property in the shelter context have emerged and evolved in the common law courts, primarily through a series of cases in British Columbia since the mid-2000s. We will aim to understand the changing scope of these rights over time, and grapple with the implications of courts\u0026rsquo; heavy reliance on a functionalist approach to the right to shelter in this context.\nRight to Shelter under the Charter # Canada\u0026rsquo;s Charter of Rights and Freedoms contains no freestanding constitutional right to housing or other forms of shelter. But in considering what protections the Charter affords to unhoused persons seeking access to public spaces to meet their immediate shelter and other basic needs, Canadian courts have developed certain limited protections under section 7 of the Charter, which reads:\nEveryone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. In our course, we will not undertake a comprehensive analysis of section 7 rights, but instead focus on a few specific features of an emerging right to shelter in the context of access to public property. This topic has a great deal to teach us about the development and implications of the modern legal style.\nIntroduction to Bamberger and the Evolving Right to Shelter # CRAB Park, Vancouver.

There was no question about the existence of the nuisance—the only issue before the court was what type of remedy should be available to the plaintiff.\nA. L. Smith L.J. — # [\u0026hellip;]\nI now come to the question whether, in a case like the present, to award damages in substitution for an injunction is, or is not, an altogether erroneous exercise of the jurisdiction given by the section. Mr. Justice Kekewich has found, and these findings are unappealed against, that the Defendants were, at the date of action brought, creating a continuing nuisance by means of vibration, noise, and steam which were produced by the working of their plant and machinery, whereby not only annoyance, inconvenience, and personal discomfort were occasioned to the Plaintiff, his wife and daughter in the occupancy of their house, but the two latter had been, by the nuisance, made actually ill. There was also evidence that the Defendants, by the erection of their works, had let down the buildings of the Plaintiffs, which consequently cracked, and that the continuous vibration which subsequently arose from the user of their plant and machinery was constantly increasing and aggravating these cracks.\nIt was proved that the Defendants were producing electricity by means of engines of from 4,000 to 5,000 horse-power, and that unless stopped by injunction they were about to increase their engine power to not less than at least 20,000 horsepower.\nIt appears to me, to use the words in the judgment of the Court in Martin v. Price, to which I was a party, that \u0026ldquo;the plain­tiff’s legal right, and its infringement already, and threatened further infringement, to a material extent,\u0026rdquo; has been established, and that \u0026ldquo;the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction according to the ordinary principles upon which the Court is in the habit of acting in these cases.\u0026rdquo;\nThen what is there in this case to take it out of the ordinary rule?\nThere is no suggestion of any conduct on the Plaintiff’s part depriving him of his prima facie right to an injunction.\nThen why is it that Mr. Justice Kekewich awarded damages in the place of an injunction?\nThe learned Judge appears to have thought that, because the Defendants at the trial had consented to abate the nuisance caused by steam, though not that caused by vibration and noise, damages were the proper remedy and adequate to compensate the Plaintiff. But I would point out that the learned Judge himself stated in his judgment that he was unable to allot to the different matters complained of the part each took in creating the undoubted nuisance proved to exist, and the reasons he gives for awarding damages are as follows\nHaving regard to the occupation not having been as a matter of money interfered with, having regard also to this, that the inconvenience is felt very much more at one part of the house than the other, almost exclusively as regards a great part of the complaint in the upper floors, and having regard at any rate to the possibility of some inconvenience and probably some loss of accommodation, of making sleeping arrangements elsewhere, which I suppose is possible, haying regard also to the large inconvenience to say no more of stopping a business such as carried on by the Defendants, I think this is a case in which damages are a very fair compensation.\nIt is here that I cannot agree with the learned Judge. Because the Plaintiff does not suffer a money loss, and is only driven out of his upper floors, and has only to make arrangements for sleeping elsewhere, he, according to the Judge, is not entitled to stop the continuance of the nuisance, but damages are a very fair compensation.\nMany Judges have stated, and I emphatically agree with them, that a person committing a wrongful act (whether it be a public company for public purposes or a private individual) is not thereby entitled to ask the Court to sanction his doing so by purchasing his neighbour’s rights, by assessing damages in that behalf, leaving his neighbour with the nuisance, or his lights dimmed, as the case may be.\nIn such cases the well-known rule is not to accede to the application, but to grant the injunction sought, for the plaintiff’s legal right has been invaded, and he is prima facie entitled to an injunction.\nThere are, however, cases in which this rule may be relaxed, and in which damages may be awarded in substitution for an injunction as authorized by this section.\nIn any instance in which a case for an injunction has been made out, if the plaintiff by his acts or laches has disentitled himself to an injunction the Court may award damages in its place. So again, whether the case be for a mandatory injunction or to restrain a continuing nuisance, the appropriate remedy may be damages in lieu of an injunction, assuming a case for an injunction to be made out.\nIn my opinion, it may be stated as a good working rule that (1) If the injury to the plaintiff’s legal rights is small, (2) and is one which is capable of being estimated in money, (3) and is one which can be adequately compensated by a small money payment, (4) and the case is one in which it would be oppressive to the defendant to grant an injunction, then damages in substitution for an injunction may be given.\nThere may also be cases in which, though the four above-mentioned requirements exist, the defendant by his conduct, as, for instance, hurrying up his buildings so as if possible to avoid an injunction, or otherwise acting with a reckless disregard to the plaintiff’s rights, has disentitled himself from asking that damages may be assessed in substitution for an injunction.\nIt is impossible to lay down any rule as to what, under the differing circumstances of each case, constitutes either a small injury, or one that can be estimated in money, or what is a small money payment, or an adequate compensation, or what would be oppressive to the defendant. This must be left to the good sense of the tribunal which deals with each case as it comes up for adjudication. For instance, an injury to the plaintiff’s legal right to light to a window in a cottage represented by £15 might well be held to be not small but considerable; whereas a similar injury to a warehouse or other large building represented by ten times that amount might be held to be inconsiderable. Each case must be decided upon its own facts; but to escape the rule it must be brought within the exception. In the present case it appears to me that the injury to the Plaintiff is certainly not small, nor is it in my judgment capable of being estimated in money, or of being adequately compensated by a small money payment.\n[…]\n"},{"id":171,"href":"/problems/short-term-rentals/","title":"Short-Term Rentals in HRM","section":"Problems","content":" Source: Étienne Beauregard-Riverin on Unsplash\nBackground # As in many cities across Canada, short-term retals have become a hot button issue in the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM). According to the HRM website:1\nShort-Term Rentals (STRs) are temporary overnight accommodations rented out for a few nights or weeks at a time. In recent years, the prevalence and popularity of STRs has grown through online platforms like Airbnb, VRBO and HomeAway. While STRs provide a unique form of a tourist accommodation and can have benefits for the local economy, their recent popularity raises concerns about their impact on residential neighborhoods and the availability of properties for long-term rental [i.e. the rental housing supply].\nSTR land-uses have not to date been prohibited or otherwise regulated under HRMs Regional Municipal Planning Strategy (RMPS) or relevant land-use bylaws.\nIn September 2020, the Halifax Regional Council directed municipal staff to begin work on proposed amendments to the RMPS and all applicable secondary planning strategies and land-use bylaws that would establish policies and regulations for STRs in residential areas of the city.\nHRM\u0026rsquo;s Halifax Mainland Land-Use Bylaw (LUB) currently lists the following permitted land uses in the R-2P Zone (\u0026ldquo;General Residential\u0026rdquo;):\nbuildings containing not more than 4 apartments; a semi-detached dwelling; a duplex dwelling; a detached one-family dwelling; the office of a professional person located in the dwelling house used by such professional person as his private residence; home occupation; a public park or playground; a church and church hall; a golf course; a tennis court; a yacht or boat club; a public recreational centre; a day care facility for not more than 8 children in conjunction with a dwelling; a special care home containing not more than ten persons including resident staff members; uses accessory to any of the foregoing uses. \u0026ldquo;Home occupation\u0026rdquo; is defined in the Halifax Mainland LUB as a \u0026ldquo;Bed and Breakfast\u0026rdquo; where the proprietor is a resident of the dwelling unit. The by-law limits the permitted use to one home occupation per lot.\nHypothetical # Suppose that the HRM Regional Council passes amendments to the Regional MPS and Halifax Mainland LUB that prohibits STRs in all residential zones.\nAfter Council adopts these amendments, a client comes to you for advice. The client owns a low-rise apartment building containing four two-bedroom apartment units in an area of Halifax zoned R-2P. For about one year prior to the zoning amendment, the client—who does not live in the building—was regularly listing and renting one of the building units on a nightly basis through AirB\u0026amp;B, from May to August. For the remaining months of the year, the unit was leased to university students on a fixed 8-month term. Two of the other units in the building were rented to long-term tenants at market rates, while the remaining unit was rent-subsidized and leased to long-term lower-income tenants. The building is located in an area of the city that has seen an influx of tourist activity and its corresponding economic benefits, but the area is also grappling with the associated consequences of rising housing prices and neighbourhood gentrification.\nThe client is seeking your advice about their plans to convert the rent-subsidized unit in the building into an additional short-term rental listed on AirB\u0026amp;B. They plan to list this and the original short-term rental unit throughout the year for rent on a weekly basis, in hopes that this model will be attractive to family vacationers (who tend to be more subdued and less annoying to the neighbours compared to weekend partygoers). Your client says that, prior to the recent by-law amendments regulating STRs, they believed that their use of the land was permitted as a \u0026ldquo;home occupation\u0026rdquo; and that the rights to continue this use are now \u0026ldquo;grandfathered in\u0026rdquo;. The client also plans to offer an \u0026ldquo;enhanced\u0026rdquo; vacation experience to their AirB\u0026amp;B renters by supplying a personal chef who will cook a gourmet meal on-site for one or more nights of their stay (a food service use which, on its own, is prohibited in residential zones).\nDo you think HRM will challenge your client\u0026rsquo;s plans?

The governments of Canada, Manitoba, and Ontario decided to create a water reservoir in northern Ontario to power hydroelectricity generation. They settled on Lac Seul, which flows into both Ontario and Manitoba, and determined that if they raised the water level of Lac Seul by 10 feet, or approximately 3 metres, they could generate substantial electricity. Construction of the dam was completed in 1929 and the water steadily rose through the 1930s. The project was a success for the three governments.\nThe project was also a tragedy for the Lac Seul First Nation (LSFN). The LSFN\u0026rsquo;s reserve (Reserve) is located on the southeastern shore of Lac Seul. Almost one-fifth of its best land was flooded and its members were \u0026ldquo;deprived of their livelihood, robbed of their natural resources, and driven out of their home[s]\u0026rdquo; (2017 FC 906, [2018] 4 C.N.L.R. 63).\nCanada was aware from the outset that flooding Lac Seul by 10 feet would cause \u0026ldquo;very considerable\u0026rdquo; damage to the Reserve. In the late 1920s, the Supervisor responsible for valuing the loss warned that the Reserve would be \u0026ldquo;ruined for any purpose [for] which it was set aside\u0026rdquo;, that the members of the First Nation were \u0026ldquo;helpless to avert this calamity\u0026rdquo;, and that they viewed their future \u0026ldquo;with utter dismay\u0026rdquo; (Trial Reasons, at paras. 152 and 156).\nDespite repeated warnings from government officials about the impact that the project would have on the First Nation, the project advanced without the consent of the Lac Seul First Nation, without any compensation, and without the lawful authorization required.\nSince the Royal Proclamation, 1763 (G.B.), 3 Geo. 3 (reproduced in R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 1), Indigenous interests in land, including reserve land, cannot be taken or used without legal authorization from the Crown. The Indian Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 98, permitted expropriation for public works, but only with the approval of Cabinet through the Governor in Council. Treaty No. 3 (1873), that set aside the reserve land for the LSFN, required \u0026ldquo;due compensation\u0026rdquo; for any taking or appropriation. In addition, this Court recognized in Guerin v. The Queen, and subsequent decisions, that the Crown is subject to a fiduciary duty when it exercises control over Indigenous interests. This fiduciary duty imposes strict obligations on the Crown to advance the best interests of Indigenous Peoples.\nThe trial judge concluded that Canada failed to meet its fiduciary duty to the Lac Seul First Nation in respect of its interest in Reserve land. On appeal, Canada does not dispute this conclusion.\nCanada did not keep the LSFN informed about the project; did not consult the LSFN; did not negotiate on the LSFN\u0026rsquo;s behalf to get the best compensation possible; did not use its power to refuse to authorize the project until the other parties agreed to fair compensation; and the compensation Canada did manage to negotiate \u0026mdash; 14 years after the flooding began \u0026mdash; was inadequate. This was unlawful and egregious conduct, even by the standards of the time. As the trial judge observed, this outcome was \u0026ldquo;inexplicable\u0026rdquo; (para. 298).\nThe results of Canada\u0026rsquo;s failures are tragic and well documented. Roughly 17 percent of the Reserve \u0026mdash; 11,304 acres or approximately 4,575 hectares \u0026mdash; is now permanently flooded. Homes were destroyed, as were wild rice fields, gardens, haylands, and gravesites. Fishing, hunting, and trapping were all impacted. The LSFN was separated because one part of the Reserve became an island. And, despite the sacrifices suffered by the LSFN to make the hydroelectricity project possible, the Reserve was not provided with electricity until the 1980s.\nThe LSFN challenges the trial judge\u0026rsquo;s evaluation of equitable compensation for the loss of the flooded lands. The issue for this Court is how to assess equitable compensation for the loss caused by Canada\u0026rsquo;s breach of fiduciary duty. The central inquiry is: what position would the beneficiary be in had the fiduciary fulfilled its obligations?\nThe trial judge valued the flooded land based on its value in 1929, with 10 percent valued as waterfront land and 90 percent valued as bushland. He determined that because Canada was authorized to expropriate the land for a public work under the provisions in force at the time, the land should be valued based upon an expropriation in 1929. Thus, the trial judge concluded that the First Nation was not entitled to be compensated for any value that the land provided to the hydroelectricity project itself.\nIn my view, this approach to equitable compensation for breach of fiduciary duty is flawed. By looking solely at the amount the LSFN would have received if Canada had complied with the general law relating to expropriation, the trial judge gave no effect to the unique obligations imposed by the fiduciary duty. The trial judge improperly focused on what Canada would likely have done, as opposed to what Canada ought to have done as a fiduciary. While I agree with much of the trial judge\u0026rsquo;s analysis, this error tainted his assessment of equitable compensation.\nThe fiduciary duty imposes heavy obligations on Canada. The duty does not melt away when Canada has competing priorities. Canada was under an obligation to preserve and protect the LSFN\u0026rsquo;s interest in the Reserve. This included an obligation to negotiate compensation for the LSFN on the basis of the value of the land to the hydroelectricity project. Compensation must be assessed on that basis.\nI would allow the appeal and remit the case back to the Federal Court for reassessment of the equitable compensation to include the value of the flooded land to the hydroelectricity project.\nI. Background # The LSFN is a Treaty 3 First Nation in Northern Ontario. The members are Anishinaabe people. According to Chief Clifford Bull, they have always been lake dwellers who travelled through the water, kept their homes and gardens near the water, cultivated wild rice in the water, fished in the water, and hunted near the water.\nThe LSFN\u0026rsquo;s traditional territory extends from the Trout Lake region in northwestern Ontario, southeast through the Lac Seul region, and northeast towards Lake St. Joseph. The LSFN has one Reserve, called the Lac Seul Indian Reserve No. 28, which is located on the southeastern shore of Lac Seul in northern Ontario. The Reserve has three communities \u0026ndash; Kejick Bay, Whitefish Bay, and Frenchman\u0026rsquo;s Head.\nThe Reserve was created under Treaty 3, which required Canada to select and set aside reserves that would be \u0026ldquo;most convenient and advantageous for each band or bands of Indians\u0026rdquo;. In 1875, the LSFN chose Lac Seul as the site of the Reserve because of the resources along the shoreline and the social, cultural, and spiritual importance of the area.\nIn the early twentieth century, Canada wanted to provide more electricity to Winnipeg. By 1911, Canada identified Lac Seul as a potential reservoir for hydroelectricity generation (Project). Lac Seul flows into the English River in Ontario, which in turn flows into the Winnipeg River in Manitoba. In 1915, the Dominion Water Power Branch, within the Department of the Interior, prepared a report noting that a 10 foot flooding of Lac Seul would increase the power potential on the English River by 233 percent.\nIn the same year, the Manitoba Hydrographic Survey began preliminary fieldwork. Chief John Akewance of the LSFN first became aware of the potential Project through the fieldwork, and wrote to Indian Agent R. S. McKenzie in 1915 outlining his concerns. Canada advised the Indian Agent that \u0026ldquo;there is no present intention to raise the waters of Lac Seul\u0026rdquo; (Trial Reasons, at para. 127).\nThe fieldwork report was released in 1916 and noted that the Project would flood portions of the Reserve. In 1917, Canada recommended to Ontario that it obtain flowage rights over the land that would need to be flooded. In 1919, Canada informed itself about the procedure for granting flowage rights on reserve land:\nIf after negotiation the offer is accepted on behalf of the Indians, or amended and so accepted, the amount of compensation agreed upon is deposited with the Minister of Finance for the use of the band of Indians and the land is surrendered. (Trial Reasons, at para. 132)\nCanada wrote to Ontario again in 1921 urging that they reserve the flooding rights. There is no record of a response.\nIn 1924, Chief Paul Thomas met with Indian Agent Frank Edwards to express the LSFN\u0026rsquo;s concerns. Agent Edwards told Chief Thomas that Canada would \u0026ldquo;protect their interests as far as possible\u0026rdquo; (Trial Reasons, at para. 137 (emphasis in original)).\nIn February 1928, Canada, Ontario, and Manitoba entered into the Lac Seul Storage Agreement which governed the construction and ownership of the Project. The agreement apportioned the capital costs among the governments, which included \u0026ldquo;the cost of acquiring flooding privileges or other necessary easements\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;compensation for timber, buildings and improvements, including Ontario Crown Lands, Indian Lands and lands owned by private individuals\u0026rdquo; (Trial Reasons, at para. 147).\nIn April 1928, Ontario wrote to affected landowners regarding the Project. Ontario also notified the Department of Indian Affairs and indicated that the water levels would be raised by approximately 12 feet. In the summer of 1928, H. J. Bury, the Supervisor of Indian Timber Lands, appraised the value of the LSFN\u0026rsquo;s anticipated losses at $120,200. Ontario disagreed with the estimate. Mr. Bury reiterated his position in two internal memoranda. On May 14, 1929, he wrote that \u0026ldquo;[t]he reserve is ruined for any purpose [for] which it was set aside ... for the Indians\u0026rdquo; (Trial Reasons, at para. 156). Two days later, he wrote:\nThere are 688 Indians on the reserve, who are helpless to avert this calamity, and who view the future with utter dismay, but I feel that the associated governments concerned, will not permit these Indians to be deprived of their livelihood, robbed of their natural resources, and driven out of their home[s], without not only allowing them generous monetary compensation, but also make provision, during the period of years in which they will have to re-adjust themselves to new and strange conditions, for exclusive trapping rights for them in a district remote from civilization. (Trial Reasons, para. 156)\nOn May 17, 1929, the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs wrote to his superior that \u0026ldquo;[t]he situation is certainly serious; and hardship and disaster appear to face these poor Indians unless some arrangement is made at once, providing for reasonable compensation and the allocation of suitable hunting and fishing grounds elsewhere\u0026rdquo; (Trial Reasons, at para. 157). No agreement regarding compensation to the LSFN was reached with Ontario.\nOntario applied for necessary approvals in July 1928. The application noted that \u0026ldquo;[i]t will be necessary in connection with the proposed work to acquire flowage rights over lands on an Indian Reserve\u0026rdquo; (Trial Reasons, at para. 159 (emphasis deleted)). Even though those rights were never acquired, the dam was completed by June 1929. The power site, the Ear Falls Generating Station, was completed and began delivering power in February 1930.\nThe flooding of Lac Seul was delayed by disagreements between Canada and Ontario regarding timber clearing. Ontario wanted to harvest its Crown timber prior to flooding. To resolve the impasse, Canada proposed that the timber clearing could be accomplished as an unemployment project under Canada\u0026rsquo;s depression-era . As negotiations for this relief project unfolded, Canada assured the LSFN\u0026rsquo;s members that \u0026ldquo;their interests will be protected to the fullest possible extent\u0026rdquo; (Trial Reasons, at para. 181 (emphasis in original)).\nIn July 1933, Canada\u0026rsquo;s Minister of the Interior signed the agreement for the relief project. A week later, the local Indian Agent and the timber supervisor assured the LSFN that the water would not be raised \u0026ldquo;for several years to come\u0026rdquo; (Trial Reasons, at para. 183). The relief project was a failure. Less than 700 acres were cleared at a cost of over $850,000 to Canada. Members of the LSFN were excluded from employment in the project.\nDespite the assurances given to the LSFN, the waters of Lac Seul began to rise in 1934. The damage was extensive. Agent Edwards estimated that at least 29 houses would need to be rebuilt \u0026mdash; in total, one-quarter to one-third of the houses ultimately had to be moved or replaced. Between 1935 and 1939, additional damage was documented. In August 1936, Canada\u0026rsquo;s Superintendent General of Indian Affairs wrote to Ontario\u0026rsquo;s Minister of Lands and Forests:\n... the Lac Seul Indian Reserve has been flooded to such a serious extent that we have been compelled already to construct many new houses for the Indians at a cost of $25,000 and the flood conditions have not only submerged the Indian hay lands, gardens and cultivated land, but have also seriously impaired the efforts of these Indians to earn their livelihood.\n... The Indians of this Reserve have been definitely assured that their interests would be fully protected and they are at present much disturbed and alarmed at the damage already caused. [Emphasis deleted.] (Trial Reasons, at para. 192)\nIn March 1937, Mr. Bury wrote a memorandum regarding the ongoing failure to provide compensation. He wrote:\nI desire to again draw your attention to the serious breach of faith that our Department has made with the Indians of the Lac Seul Reserve, respecting promises made to them regarding flooding compensation ...\n[\u0026hellip;]\nI consider that these Indians have been very shabbily treated. Their Reserve lands, timber, houses, gardens, rice beds, musk-rat swamps have been flooded now for some years, and we still procrastinate[.] [I]f it had been a white settlement, no person would have dared to flood the property, without paying compensation before flooding took place. [Emphasis deleted.] (Trial Reasons, at para. 194)\nNegotiations between Canada and Ontario continued. In 1940, Ontario determined that $50,000 would be a \u0026ldquo;fair valuation\u0026rdquo; of compensation, but Ontario also claimed it was owed compensation for what it viewed as excess acres on the Reserve as well as outstanding claims for timber clearing. The LSFN was not consulted nor informed of the impending settlement.\nIn 1943, Canada and Ontario finally agreed to a claim amount of $72,539, with deductions of $5,000 to pay a timber claim submitted by a lumber company and $17,276 to pay Ontario for \u0026ldquo;excess acres\u0026rdquo; on the Reserve. The balance, $50,263, was deposited into the LSFN\u0026rsquo;s trust account on November 17, 1943.\nBy contrast, Ontario and Canada negotiated compensation with other non-Indigenous groups whose property fell within the flood plain of the dam project, such as the Anglican Church Missionary Society, the Hudson\u0026rsquo;s Bay Company, and the Canadian National Railway. For instance, the Anglican Church Missionary Society received compensation for the timber destroyed in the floods and for the costs of relocating its church and cemetery. Similarly, the Hudson\u0026rsquo;s Bay Company engaged in protracted negotiations with the federal government that resulted in compensation not only for \u0026ldquo;Flowage Rights\u0026rdquo; over the company\u0026rsquo;s territory, but also for the value of the buildings and other facilities.\nCanada\u0026rsquo;s conduct towards the LSFN also differs from its conduct in three earlier projects that impacted another First Nation. In the early 1910s, Calgary Power and Transmission sought permission from Indian Affairs to flood reserve lands of the Stoney Indian Band in Alberta for three hydroelectricity projects (Kananaskis Falls Projects). For all three projects, Canada negotiated a surrender on behalf of the First Nation and insisted on compensation reflecting the value of the land to hydroelectricity generation. Calgary Power entered into three agreements which provided two forms of compensation: a one-time payment for flooded land and a yearly water power rental agreement. This compensation was based upon the value of the land to the project.\nHere, there was never a negotiated surrender of the land by the LSFN and Canada did not at any point expropriate the land in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Act. Nonetheless, the Project was completed in 1929 and the lands were steadily flooded throughout the 1930s. A total of 11,304 acres, approximately 17 percent of the Reserve, is now flooded. The flooding destroyed wild rice fields, gardens, and haylands for livestock. It impacted fishing and damaged homes, campsites, and shoreline infrastructure. The flooding damaged and exposed graves that were not relocated prior to the flooding. One of the LSFN\u0026rsquo;s communities, Kejick Bay, became an island separated from the other communities.\nIn September 1985, the LSFN submitted a claim for flooding damages to the Specific Claims Branch of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada. In 1991, Roger Southwind, for himself and on behalf of the members of the Lac Seul Band of Indians, filed a civil claim against Canada. In November 2006, 63 years after the settlement, the LSFN entered into an agreement with Ontario Power Generation (OPG), the current operator of the Ear Falls Generating Station. The agreement included $11,200,000 in compensation for losses arising from the Ear Falls Generating Station on the LSFN\u0026rsquo;s traditional territory, but expressly excluded damages caused by the flooding in the 1930s. The settlement included a plan to open a new generating station and provided the LSFN with the opportunity to purchase an equity position of 25 percent. In February 2009, OPG opened the new generating station in partnership with the First Nation. In 2009, a causeway was built to finally reconnect Kejick Bay Island and the Reserve mainland. The LSFN contributed $1,750,000 to this and a related project.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIII. Analysis # A. Canada\u0026rsquo;s Fiduciary Duty to Indigenous Peoples # The existence of a fiduciary duty is not in dispute in this appeal. Canada does not contest the trial judge\u0026rsquo;s determination that Canada owed a fiduciary duty to the LSFN and breached that duty. However, the specific nature of the Crown\u0026rsquo;s fiduciary duty to Indigenous Peoples, especially over reserve land, informs how equitable compensation must be assessed.\nThe Crown\u0026rsquo;s fiduciary duty is rooted in the obligation of honourable dealing and in the overarching goal of reconciliation between the Crown and the first inhabitants of Canada (Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests) 2004 SCC 73, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 511, at paras. 17-18). Professor Slattery describes the honour of the Crown as a \u0026ldquo;grounding postulate of Canadian constitutional law\u0026rdquo; (B. Slattery, \u0026ldquo;The Aboriginal Constitution\u0026rdquo; (2014), 67 S.C.L.R. (2d) 319, at p. 320). McLachlin C.J. explained in Haida Nation that the \u0026ldquo;process of reconciliation flows from the Crown\u0026rsquo;s duty of honourable dealing toward Aboriginal peoples, which arises in turn from the Crown\u0026rsquo;s assertion of sovereignty over an Aboriginal people and de facto control of land and resources that were formerly in the control of that people\u0026rdquo; (para. 32; see also R. v. Desautel, 2021 SCC 17, [2021] X S.C.R. XXX, at para. 22). This is an ongoing project that seeks the \u0026ldquo;reconciliation of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians in a mutually respectful long-term relationship\u0026rdquo; (Beckman v. Little Salmon/Carmacks First Nation2010 SCC 53, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 103, at para. 10).\nThis Court first acknowledged a fiduciary duty in Guerin. In Guerin, Canada argued that it could not be subject to a fiduciary duty and, at best, the Crown\u0026rsquo;s control over Indigenous interests in land is a political trust which is unenforceable by the courts (p. 371). Dickson J., writing for a majority, rejected Canada\u0026rsquo;s argument. Instead, he found that Indigenous interests in land are \u0026ldquo;a pre-existing legal right not created by Royal Proclamation, by s. 18(1) of the Indian Act, or by any other executive order or legislative provision\u0026rdquo; (p. 379; see also J. T. S. McCabe, The Honour of the Crown and its Fiduciary Duties to Aboriginal Peoples (2008), at pp. 150-51). In other words, the Indigenous interest in land did not flow from the Crown; it pre-existed the Crown\u0026rsquo;s assertion of sovereignty.\nThrough the Royal Proclamation, 1763, the Crown undertook discretionary control over these pre-existing Indigenous interests in land. The Proclamation provided: \u0026ldquo;And We do hereby strictly forbid, on Pain of our Displeasure, all our loving Subjects from making any Purchases or Settlements whatever, or taking Possession of any of the Lands above reserved, without our especial leave and Licence for that Purpose first obtained.\u0026rdquo; The Indian Act and its predecessor statutes formalized the process for setting aside reserve land and the Crown\u0026rsquo;s legal control over that land. The Crown thus undertook the \u0026ldquo;historic responsibility ... to act on behalf of the Indians so as to protect their interests in transactions with third parties\u0026rdquo; (Guerin, at p. 383). In Guerin, this Court recognized that a fiduciary duty arose because the Crown interposed itself between Indigenous lands and those who want to lease or purchase the land, thereby exercising discretionary control over the land (pp. 383-84). The Crown has a duty that is \u0026ldquo;in the nature of a private law duty\u0026rdquo; (p. 385).\nIn Osoyoos Indian Band v. Oliver (Town), 2001 SCC 85, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 746, Gonthier J., dissenting, but not on that point, clarified that the same fiduciary duty applies even where the reserve is not situated on traditional territory in which the First Nation may have a pre-existing legal interest. He noted: \u0026ldquo;... an interest in reserve lands to which no aboriginal title attaches and an interest in non-reserve lands to which aboriginal title does attach are the same with respect to the generation of a fiduciary obligation on the part of the Crown\u0026rdquo; (para. 163).\nGuerin set to rest the idea that the trust-like language of historic treaties, laws, and proclamations constituted a mere \u0026ldquo;political trust\u0026rdquo; unenforceable in courts. Instead, an enforceable sui generis fiduciary duty arose where the Crown asserted discretionary power over Indigenous Peoples\u0026rsquo; specific Aboriginal interests and assumed responsibility for those interests (R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075, at p. 1108). This relationship is not paternalistic in nature; it emerged in a context where the military capacities of Indigenous Peoples were strong and the Crown needed to mitigate the risk of conflict between Indigenous Peoples and settlers (Manitoba Metis Federation Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General) 2013 SCC 14, [2013] 1 S.C.R. 623, at para. 66; Slattery, at pp. 322 and 326).\nRooted in the honour of the Crown, the Crown\u0026rsquo;s fiduciary duty exists to further a socially important relationship. It structures the role voluntarily undertaken by the Crown as the intermediary between Indigenous interests in land and the interest of settlers. Professor Rotman, in the context of fiduciary relationships generally, puts it this way: \u0026ldquo;... while it may appear that the fiduciary concept exists to protect beneficiaries\u0026rsquo; interests, that effect is merely ancillary to its protection of fiduciary relationships\u0026rdquo; (L. I. Rotman, \u0026ldquo;Understanding Fiduciary Duties and Relationship Fiduciarity\u0026rdquo; (2017), 62 McGill L.J. 975, at pp. 987-88). In the context of our national history, the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous Peoples goes to the very foundation of this country and to the heart of its identity. Indeed, the need to reconcile the assertion of Crown sovereignty with the pre-existence of Indigenous Peoples, and to reconcile Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians is of \u0026ldquo;fundamental importance\u0026rdquo; (R. v. Van der Peet[1996] 2 S.C.R. 507, at para. 310, per McLachlin J., dissenting, but not on this point). The honour of the Crown \u0026ndash; and the sui generis fiduciary duty to which it gives rise \u0026ndash; is a vital component of the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous Peoples.\nHowever, not all aspects of this relationship are fiduciary in nature (Haida Nation, at para. 18; Wewaykum Indian Band v. Canada2002 SCC 79, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 245, at paras. 81 and 83). The fiduciary duty does not attach to every interest of Indigenous Peoples. As Binnie J. stated in Wewaykum, \u0026ldquo;[t]he fiduciary duty imposed on the Crown does not exist at large but in relation to specific Indian interests\u0026rdquo; (para. 81). The fiduciary duty imposes heavy obligations when it does arise. The fiduciary duty may arise when the Crown exercises discretionary control over cognizable Indigenous interests or where the conditions of a private law ad hoc fiduciary relationship are met (Williams Lake Indian Band v. Canada (Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development) 2018 SCC 4, [2018] 1 S.C.R. 83, at para. 44; Manitoba Metis, at paras. 48-50; Wewaykum, at para. 85).\nThe fiduciary duty itself is shaped by the context to which it applies, which means that its content varies with the nature and the importance of the right being protected (Williams Lake, at para. 55; Wewaykum, at para. 86; Manitoba Metis, at para. 49). The Crown\u0026rsquo;s control over Indigenous interests in land is at the core of the relationship between the Crown and Indigenous Peoples. Consequently, a strong fiduciary duty arises where the Crown is exercising control over a First Nation\u0026rsquo;s land. The same is true where the Crown is exercising control over Aboriginal and treaty rights that are protected under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 (Ermineskin Indian Band and Nation v. Canada 2009 SCC 9, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 222, at para. 46).\nIn a case involving reserve land, the sui generis nature of the interest in reserve land informs the fiduciary duty. Reserve land is not a fungible commodity. Instead, reserve land reflects the essential relationship between Indigenous Peoples and the land. In Osoyoos, Iacobucci J. wrote that Aboriginal interests in land has an \u0026ldquo;important cultural component that reflects the relationship between an aboriginal community and the land and the inherent and unique value in the land itself which is enjoyed by the community\u0026rdquo; (para. 46). The importance of the interest in reserve land is heightened by the fact that, in many cases such as this one, the reserve land was set aside as part of an obligation that arose out of treaties between the Crown and Indigenous Peoples.\nThe fiduciary duty imposes the following obligations on the Crown: loyalty, good faith, full disclosure, and, where reserve land is involved, the protection and preservation of the First Nation\u0026rsquo;s quasi-proprietary interest from exploitation (Williams Lake, at para. 46; Wewaykum, at para. 86). The standard of care is that of a person of ordinary prudence in managing their own affairs (Williams Lake, at para. 46). In the context of a surrender of reserve land, this Court has recognized that the duty also requires that the Crown protect against improvident bargains, manage the process to advance the best interests of the First Nation, and ensure that it consents to the surrender (Blueberry River Indian Band v. Canada (Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development)[1995] 4 S.C.R. 344, at paras. 35 and 96). In an expropriation, the obligation to ensure consent is replaced by an obligation to minimally impair the protected interest (Osoyoos, at para. 54).\n[The Court went on to find that Canada breached its obligation to preserve and protect the LSFN’s interest in its reserve lands. This obligation included negotiating compensation based on the value of the land for the hydroelectricity project. The Court concluded that the LSFN was entitled to compensation for the opportunity it lost in negotiating an agreement based on this value.]\nAppeal allowed\n"},{"id":174,"href":"/casebook/title/stcatherines/","title":"St. Catherine's Milling and Lumber Co. v R","section":"Chapter 3","content":" Background to the Case # For more than a hundred years after it was enacted, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 stood as the British Crown\u0026rsquo;s most authoritative statement on Aboriginal title. But during this period the Proclamation itself received little to no scrutiny in the common law courts. This changed dramatically when the Chancery Division of the High Court of Ontario issued its decision in St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling and Lumber Co. v R in 1886, followed by subsequent appeals all the way to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council—at that time, Canada\u0026rsquo;s highest court of appeal. The case would chart the course for the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title in Canada for well into the next century.\nSet in the two decades after Confederation in 1867, the background dispute in St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling between the Province of Ontario and the Dominion Government (Canada) was nominally about which level of government held title to public lands within the geographic boundaries of Ontario that had—according to Canada\u0026rsquo;s interpretation of treaty rights—been ceded to the Crown by the Saulteaux (Nahkawininiwak) of the Anishinaabe Nation as part of Treaty 3 (the North-West Angle Treaty). In the course of trying to resolve that dispute, the common law courts pronounced on the nature of Aboriginal title in ways that had far-reaching consequences. At issue in St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling is not the courts\u0026rsquo; interpretation of Treaty 3 rights, but of the land rights that preceded that treaty as a matter of the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title.\nTo understand St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling and is implications, it is important to appreciate the context in which the question of Aboriginal title came before the courts. As Kent McNeil observes in his history of the case, \u0026ldquo;[t]he 1880s were years of adversity and deprivation for Indigenous peoples, who were facing the unrelenting advance of imperialism in various parts of the world.\u0026rdquo;1 \u0026ldquo;During the same period,\u0026rdquo; McNeil writes, \u0026ldquo;the taking of Indigenous lands, suppression of Indigenous political authority, and forced assimilation were also proceeding in Canada,\u0026rdquo;2 underpinned by the rising prominence of social darwinism and by westward economic expansion and resulting, among other abuses, in the creation of the residential school system.\nThe Facts # The facts and law in this case are reasonably complicated. Essentially, the case involves an underlying dispute between the Province of Ontario and the Dominion Government (Canada) about who is entitled to use and gain revenue from public lands within the political boundaries of Ontario. Understanding the factual and legal context of the case is a useful exercise in learning how to make sense of a complex legal setting across multiple judicial decisions. Here, I will aim to sketch the outlines of that context to help you interpret the case.\nFor our purposes, the main legal dispute in St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling turns on the interpretation of Section 109 of the Constitution Act, 1867. That provision reads:\nAll Lands, Mines, Minerals, and Royalties belonging to the several Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick at the Union, and all Sums then due or payable for such Lands, Mines, Minerals, or Royalties, shall belong to the several Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick in which the same are situate or arise, subject to any Trusts existing in respect thereof, and to any Interest other than that of the Province in the same. In effect, Section 109 says that any legal entitlements in land \u0026ldquo;belonging to\u0026rdquo; the former Province of Canada prior to 1867 (i.e. in lands not held by private interests or otherwise taken up) passed to the Province of Ontario at Confederation. The question in St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling was therefore whether or not the rights in land at issue\u0026ndash;those that would be subject to Treaty 3 after 1873\u0026ndash;\u0026ldquo;belonged to\u0026rdquo; the the former Province of Canada before 1867. Lord Watson, in his decision for the Privy Council, refers to these rights as the \u0026ldquo;beneficial interest\u0026rdquo; (or \u0026ldquo;beneficial title\u0026rdquo;) in the lands, as distinguished from the underlying or radical title, which is held by the Crown.\nSt. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s Milling and Lumber Company, the defendant, argued that these land rights did not \u0026ldquo;belong\u0026rdquo; to the Province of Canada prior to 1867, because title to those lands was held by the Saulteaux as Aboriginal title\u0026ndash;a form of title recognized in and by the Royal Proclamation. The fact of Aboriginal title meant that the land rights did not \u0026ldquo;belong\u0026rdquo; to the Province of Canada and therefore could not have passed to Ontario by virtue of Section 109. It was this Aboriginal title, according to the defendant\u0026rsquo;s view, that was later ceded to the Crown through Treaty 3. On the basis of the \u0026ldquo;beneficial interest\u0026rdquo; acquired by Canada through Treaty 3, it granted licenses to the company to engage in forestry on the lands.\nThe defendant bolstered its argument about Section 109 of the Constitution Act, 1867 by citing another provision in that same Act, namely Section 91(24) which refers to Canada\u0026rsquo;s jurisdiction over \u0026ldquo;lands reserved for the Indians\u0026rdquo;. The basic argument here is that lands subject to Aboriginal title fall within Section 91(24) and are consequently excluded from Section 109.\nOntario disagreed with the defendant\u0026rsquo;s interpretation of the law, arguing that on \u0026ldquo;unceded\u0026rdquo; lands prior to 1867, the beneficial interest in the lands was not held by the Saulteaux under any recognized form of common law title and therefore \u0026ldquo;belonged to\u0026rdquo; the Province of Canada, passing to Ontario at Confederation. This argument required Ontario to deny that Aboriginal title is or should be considered a recognized legal interest in land capable of displacing a province\u0026rsquo;s beneficial interest.\nWhile the dispute in the case is one about the respective entitlements of Ontario and Canada, we are reading the judgments below in order to understand how the judges\u0026rsquo; reasons shaped the common law doctrine of Aboriginal title. As it turns out, the answer to the question, \u0026ldquo;What is Aboriginal title and what is its source?\u0026rdquo; becomes central to resolving the case. At the same time, it is obvious that the Indigenous communities whose rights were at stake were not actually parties to the case. As becomes clear from the judgments, Indigenous voices and interests were entirely absent in the early development of a legal doctrine that would come to have such enormous significance for Indigenous peoples and communities.\nProcedurally, Ontario succeeds at trial before Chancellor Boyd in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Ontario and in every appeal of that decision that follows. In addition to Chancellor Boyd\u0026rsquo;s decision, we will read Justice Strong\u0026rsquo;s dissenting judgement at the Supreme Court of Canada and Lord Watson\u0026rsquo;s decision upon final appeal to the Privy Council in 1888. Each judge approaches the issue of Aboriginal title from a different perspective, and by reading these decisions together we can gain a much deeper understanding of how classical legal thought has shaped common law principles about Indigenous land rights.\nSome of the decisions below contain racist language and espouse an explicitly racist ideology. Please be aware of this before you start your reading and contact me if you have concerns about how to read the material or about how we will address it in class. It is a difficult case to read, and we should be mindful of the real harms that this decision continues to perpetrate\u0026ndash;not only as \u0026ldquo;historical\u0026rdquo; material but also for its lasting influence on the common law of property. I assign this reading because I think it is important to see how the reasoning has grounded and shaped the doctrine of Aboriginal title that we will study throughout the course. Please pay close attention to the ways in which Chancellor Boyd\u0026rsquo;s racist assumptions about and misrepresentations of Indigenous peoples rely on ideas about \u0026ldquo;natural order\u0026rdquo; that we have seen in other materials so far in this course.\nHigh Court of Ontario (Boyd Ch.) # The Province of Ontario seeks the intervention of the Court in order that the St. Catherines Milling and Lumber Company may be restrained from trespassing and cutting timber on lands claimed by the Province. The defendants justify under license obtained from the Government of Canada in April, 1883, by virtue of which they assert the right to cut over timber limits on the south side of Wabigoon (or Wabegon) Lake, in that portion of Canada situated between Lake Superior and Eagle Lake. The defendants further plead specially that the place in question forms part of a district till recently claimed by tribes of Indians, who inhabited that part of the Dominion, and that such claims have always been recognized by the various Governments of Canada and Ontario, and by the Crown; that such Indian claims were paramount to the claim of the Province of Ontario, and that the Dominion have by purchase acquired the said Indian title, and by reason thereof, as well as by inherent right, the Dominion and not the Province is alone entitled to deal with the said timber limits.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe colonial policy of Great Britain as it regards the claims and treatment of the aboriginal populations in America, has been from the first uniform and well-defined. Indian peoples were found scattered wide-cast over the continent, having, as a characteristic, no fixed abodes, but moving as the exigencies of living demanded. As heathens and barbarians it was not thought that they had any proprietary title to the soil, nor any such claim thereto as to interfere with the plantations, and the general prosecution of colonization. They were treated \u0026ldquo;justly and graciously,\u0026rdquo; as Lord Bacon advised, but no legal ownership of the land was ever attributed to them. The Attorney-General in his argument called my attention to a joint opinion given by a \u0026ldquo;multitude of counsellors,\u0026rdquo; about 1675, touching land in New York, while yet a province under English rule. I think it accurately states the constitutional law in these words:\nThough it hath been and still is the usual practice of all proprietors to give their Indians some recompense for their land, and so seem to purchase it of them, yet that is not done for want of sufficient title from the King or Prince who hath the right of Discovery, but out of prudence and Christian charity least otherwise the Indians might have destroyed the first planters (who are usually too few to defend themselves) or refuse all Commerce and Conversation with the planters, and thereby all hopes of converting them to the Christian faith would he lost. In this the Common law of England and the Civil law doth agree. … Though some planters have purchased from the Indians yet having done so without the Consent of the Proprietors for the time being, the title is good against the Indians but not against the Proprietors without a confirmation from them upon the usual terms of other Plantations.\u0026quot;—Vol. xiii. \u0026ldquo;Documents relating to Colonial History of the State of New York,\u0026rdquo; p. 486.\nOf the six counsel who sign this opinion, one (Richard Wallop) became Cursitor Baron of the Exchequer; another (Henry Pollexfen) became Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and a third (Holt) was afterwards Chief Justice of England.\nIn a classical judgment, Marshall, C. J., has concisely stated the same law of the mother-country which the United States inherited and applied with such modifications as were necessitated by the change of government to their dealings with the Indians. I quote passages from Johnson v. Mcintosh, 8 Wheat., p. 595, \u0026amp;c.:\nAccording to the theory of the British constitution, all vacant lands are vested in the Crown, as representing the nation; and the exclusive power to grant them is admitted to reside in the Crown, as a branch of the royal prerogative. … This principle was as fully recognized in America as in the island of Great Britain. … So far as respected the authority of the Crown no distinction was taken between vacant lands and lands occupied by the Indians. … The title, subject to the right of occupancy by the Indians, was admitted to be in the king, as was his right to grant that title.\nAt p. 588:\nAll our institutions recognize the absolute title of the Crown, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy, and recognize the absolute title of the Crown to extinguish that right.\nThis right of occupancy attached to the Indians in their tribal character. They were incapacitated from transferring it to any stranger, though it was susceptible of being extinguished. The exclusive power to procure its extinguishment was vested in the Crown, a power which as a rule was exercised only on just and equitable terms. If this title was sought to be acquired by others than the Crown, the attempted transfer passed nothing, and could operate only as an extinguishment of the Indian right for the benefit of the title paramount. See judgment of Burns, J., in Doe d. Sheldon v. Ramsay, 9 U.C.R. at p. 133.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAt the time of the conquest, the Indian population of Lower Canada was, as a body, Christianized, and in possession of villages and settlements, known as the \u0026ldquo;Indian Country.\u0026rdquo; By the terms of capitulation they were guaranteed the enjoyment of these territorial rights in such lands which, in course of time, became distinctively and technically called \u0026ldquo;Reserves.\u0026rdquo; By a Quebec ordinance of Guy Carleton of 1777, (17 George III. ch. 7, sec. 3,) it was declared unlawful for any person to settle in the Indian country within that Province without a written license from the Governor, and no person was allowed to trade without license in any part of the Province upon lands not granted by His Majesty.\nBut in Upper Canada the native tribes were in an untaught and uncivilized condition, and it became necessary to work out a scheme of settlement which would promote immigration and protect both red and white subjects so that their contact in the interior might not become collision. A modus vivendi had to be adjusted. [\u0026hellip;] The inevitable problem in view of the necessary territorial constriction of the Indian occupants of those vast expanses over which they and their forefathers have fished and hunted and trapped from time immemorial was and is this: how best to subserve the welfare of the whole community and the state, how best to protect and encourage the individual settler, and how best to train and restrain the Indian so that being delivered by degrees from dependency and pupillage, he may be deemed worthy to possess all the rights and immunities and responsibilities of complete citizenship. These three considerations, mainly, have shaped the policy of the Government in the past as in the present.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nBut it is argued for the defendants that the key to unlock the meaning of the Act of 1867 must be sought in the Royal Proclamation of 1763.\nThe scope and object of that instrument, therefore, require to be considered. The primary intent of the proclamation was to provide, temporarily, for the orderly conduct of affairs in the settled parts of all the territory newly acquired in America, which was for that purpose subdivided into the four Governments of Quebec, East Florida, West Florida, and Grenada, and to encourage further settlement by the promise of the immediate enjoyment of English law. Power was conferred upon the governors and councils of the three colonies on the continent to grant such lands as were then or thereafter should be in the power of the Crown to dispose of, on such terms and conditions as might be necessary and expedient for the advantage of the grantees, and the improvement and settlement of the colonies. So far as lands lay without the limits of these colonies, the governors were forbidden to grant patents, or to deal with them, and this chiefly on account of the several nations or tribes of Indians who were living under British protection. That prohibition was to last only \u0026ldquo;for the present, and till the King\u0026rsquo;s further pleasure\u0026rdquo; should be known, and it is preceded by a recital that it is just, and reasonable, and essential to our interest, and the security of our colonies, that such Indians with whom we are connected, and who live under our protection should not be molested or disturbed in the possession of such parts of our dominions and territories, as not having been ceded to or purchased \u0026ldquo;by us, are reserved for them or any of them, as their hunting grounds.\u0026rdquo;\nThe proclamation next proceeds to deal with that part of the country which would then embrace the land now in question as follows: \u0026ldquo;And we do further declare it to be our Royal will and pleasure, for the present, as aforesaid, to reserve under our sovereignty, protection, and dominion for the use of the said Indians all the lands and territories not included within the limits of the territory granted to the Hudson\u0026rsquo;s Bay Company; as also all the land and territories lying to the westward of the sources of the rivers which fall into the sea from the West and North-West as aforesaid; and we do hereby strictly forbid, on pain of our displeasure, all our loving subjects from making any purchases or settlements whatsoever, or taking possession of any of the lands above reserved without our especial leave and license for that purpose first obtained; and we do further strictly enjoin and require all persons whatsoever, who have either wilfully or inadvertently seated themselves upon any lands within the countries above described, or upon any other lands which not having been ceded to, or purchased by us are still reserved to the said Indians, as aforesaid, forthwith, to remove themselves from such settlements.\u0026rdquo;\nThe proclamation then forbids private persons from presuming to make any purchases from the Indians of any lands reserved to the said Indians \u0026ldquo;within those parts of our colonies where we have thought proper to allow settlement,\u0026rdquo; and directs that if at any time the Indians shall be inclined to dispose of the said lands, the same shall be purchased for us at some public meeting of the Indians to be held for that purpose by the Governor of the colony within which they shall lie.\nThis proclamation has frequently been referred to, and by the Indians themselves, as the charter of their rights, and the last clause I have condensed relating to the manner of dealing with them in respect to lands they occupy at large, or as a reserve, has always been scrupulously observed in such transactions.\n[…]\nThere is an essential difference in meaning between the \u0026ldquo;reservations\u0026rdquo; spoken of in the Royal Proclamation, and the like term in the B.N.A. Act. The proclamation views the Indians in their wild state, and leaves them there in undisturbed and unlimited possession of all their hunting ranges, whereas the Act, though giving jurisdiction to the Dominion over all Indians, wild or settled, does not transfer to that government all public or waste lands of the Provinces on which they may be found at large.\nThe territorial jurisdiction of the Dominion extends only to lands reserved for them. Now it is evident from the history of \u0026ldquo;the reserves,\u0026rdquo; that the Indians there are regarded no longer as in a wild and primitive state, but as in a condition of transition from barbarism to civilization. The object of the system is to segregate the red from the white population, in order that the former may be trained up to a level with the latter. The key-note of the whole movement was struck unmistakably in 1838, by Lord Glenelg, in his instructions to Sir Francis Bond Head: (Appendix to Journals of Assembly, 1837-8, p. 180.) He wrote thus: \u0026ldquo;The first step to the real improvement of the Indians is to gain them over from a wandering to a settled life, and for this purpose it is essential that they should have a sense of permanency in the locations assigned to them; that they should be attached to the soil by being taught to regard it as reserved for them and their children by the strongest securities.\u0026rdquo; The distinctive feature of the system in Canada was the grouping of the separate tribes for the purposes of exclusive and permanent residence within circumscribed limits. Those limits were almost invariably allocated at their usual centres of settlement, and within the ambit of their respective hunting ranges as recognized among themselves. Contrasted with this is the plan chiefly followed in the United States, where the main object has been to mass all the Indian nations and tribes in one vast district called \u0026ldquo;The Indian Territory,\u0026rdquo; which comprises an area of about 70,000 square miles. But in Canada, the bounds of the separate reserves being ascertained by survey or otherwise, the various communities betake themselves thereto as their \u0026ldquo;local habitation.\u0026rdquo; Here they are furnished with appliances and opportunities to make themselves independent of the precarious subsistence procured from the chase; they are encouraged to advance from a nomadic to an agricultural or pastoral life, and thus to acquire ideas of separate property, and of the value of individual rights to which, in their erratic tribal condition, they are utter strangers, so that, ultimately, they may be led to settle down into the industrious and peaceful habits of a civilized people.\nAgain: the relations between the Government and the Indians change upon the establishment of reserves. While in the nomadic state they may or may not choose to treat with the Crown for the extinction of their primitive right of occupancy. If they refuse the government is not hampered, but has perfect liberty to proceed with the settlement and development of the country, and so, sooner or later, to displace them. If, however, they elect to treat they then become, in a special sense, wards of the State, are surrounded by its protection while under pupillage, and have their rights assured in perpetuity to the usual land reserve. In regard to this reserve the tribe enjoy practically all the advantages and safeguards of private resident proprietors: Bastien v. Hoffman, 17 L. C. R. 238. Before the appropriation of reserves the Indians have no claim except upon the bounty and benevolence of the Crown. After the appropriation, they become invested with a legally recognized tenure of defined lands; in which they have a present right as to the exclusive and absolute usufruct, and a potential right of becoming individual owners in fee after enfranchisement. It is \u0026ldquo;lands reserved\u0026rdquo; in this sense for the Indians which form the subject of legislation in the B.N.A. Act, i. e., lands upon which or by means of the proceeds of which, after being surrendered for sale, the tribes are to be trained for civilization under the auspices of the Dominion. It follows that lands ungranted upon which Indians are living at large in their primitive state within any Province form part of the public lands, and are held as before Confederation by that Province under various sections of the B.N.A. Act. [See sees. 92 (item 5), also sees. 6, 109 and 117.] Such a class of public lands are appropriately alluded to in section 109 as lands belonging to the Province in which the Indians have an interest, i. e., their possessory interest. When this interest is dealt with by being extinguished, and by way of compensation in part, reserves are allocated, then the jurisdiction of the Dominion attaches to those reserves. But the rest of the land in which \u0026ldquo;the Indian title\u0026rdquo; so called has not been extinguished remains with its character unchanged as the public property of the Province.\n[…]\nSupreme Court of Canada (Strong J., dissenting) # Strong J. — # [\u0026hellip;]\nIn the Commentaries of Chancellor Kent and in some decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States we have very full and clear accounts of the policy in question. It may be summarily stated as consisting in the recognition by the crown of a usufructuary title in the Indians to all unsurrendered lands. This title, though not perhaps susceptible of any accurate legal definition in exact legal terms, was one which nevertheless sufficed to protect the Indians in the absolute use and enjoyment of their lands, whilst at the same time they were incapacitated from making any valid alienation otherwise than to the crown itself, in whom the ultimate title was, in accordance with the English law of real property, considered as vested.\nThis short statement will, I think, on comparison with the authorities to which I will presently refer, be found to be an accurate description of the principles upon which the crown invariably acted with reference to Indian lands, at least from the year 1756, when Sir William Johnston was appointed by the Imperial Government superintendent of Indian affairs in North America, being as such responsible directly to the crown through one of the Secretaries of State, or the Lords of Trade and Plantation, and thus superseding the Provincial Governments, down to the year 1867, when the confederation act constituting the Dominion of Canada was passed. So faithfully was this system carried out, that I venture to say that there is no settled part of the territory of the Province of Ontario, except perhaps some isolated spots upon which the French Government had, previous to the conquest, erected forts, such as Fort Frontenac and Fort Toronto, which is not included in and covered by a surrender contained in some Indian treaty still to be found in the Dominion Archives.\nThese rules of policy being shown to have been well established and acted upon, and the title of the Indians to their unsurrendered lands to have been recognized by the crown to the extent already mentioned, it may seem of little importance to enquire into the reasons on which it was based. But as these reasons are not without some bearing on the present question, as I shall hereafter shew, I will shortly refer to what appears to have led to the adoption of the system of dealing with the territorial rights of the Indians. To ascribe it to moral grounds, to motives of humane consideration for the aborigines, would be to attribute it to feelings which perhaps had little weight in the age in which it took its rise. Its true origin was, I take it, experience of the great impolicy of the opposite mode of dealing with the Indians which had been practised by some of the Provincial Governments of the older colonies and which had led to frequent frontier wars, involving great sacrifices of life and property and requiring an expenditure of money which had proved most burdensome to the colonies. That the more liberal treatment accorded to the Indians by this system of protecting them in the enjoyment of their hunting grounds and prohibiting settlement on lands which they had not surrendered, which it is now contended the British North America Act has put an end to, was successful in its results, is attested by the historical fact that from the memorable year 1763, when Detroit was besieged and all the Indian tribes were in revolt, down to the date of confederation, Indian wars and massacres entirely ceased in the British possessions in North America, although powerful Indian nations still continued for some time after the former date to inhabit those territories.\nThat this peaceful conduct of the Indians is in a great degree to be attributed to the recognition of their rights to lands unsurrendered by them, and to the guarantee of their protection in the possession and enjoyment of such lands given by the crown in the proclamation of October, 1763, hereafter to be more fully noticed, is a well known fact of Canadian history which cannot be controverted. The Indian nations from that time became and have since continued to be the firm and faithful allies of the crown and rendered it important military services in two wars — the war of the Revolution and that of 1812.\nThe American authorities, to which reference has already been made, consist (amongst others) of passages in the commentaries of Chancellor Kent, in which the whole doctrine of Indian titles is fully and elaborately considered, and of several decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, from which three, Johnston v. McIntosh, Worcester v. State of Georgia, and Mitchell v. United States, may be selected as leading cases. The value and importance of these authorities is not merely that they show that the same doctrine as that already propounded regarding the title of the Indians to unsurrendered lands prevails in the United States, but, what is of vastly greater importance, they without exception refer its origin to a date anterior to the revolution and recognise it as a continuance of the principles of law or policy as to Indian titles then established by the British government, and therefore identical with those which have also continued to be recognized and applied in British North America. Chancellor Kent, referring to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, in Cherokee Nation v. State of Georgia, says: —\nThe court there held that the Indians were domestic, dependent nations, and their relation to us resembled that of a ward to his guardian; and they had an unquestionable right to the lands they occupied until that right should be extinguished by a voluntary cession to our government.\nOn the same page the learned commentator proceeds thus: —\nThe Supreme Court in the case of Worcester reviewed the whole ground of controversy relative to the character and validity of Indian rights within the territorial dominions of the United States, and especially with reference to the Cherokee nation within the limits of Georgia. They declared that the right given by European discovery was the exclusive right to purchase, but this right was not founded on a denial of the Indian possessor to sell. Though the right of the soil was claimed to be in the European governments as a necessary consequence of the right of discovery and assumption of territorial jurisdiction, yet that right was only deemed such in reference to the whites; and in respect to the Indians it was always understood to amount only to the exclusive right of purchasing such lands as the natives were willing to sell. The royal grants and charters asserted a title to the country against Europeans only, and they were considered as blank paper so far as the rights of the natives were concerned. The English, the French and the Spaniards were equal competitors for the friendship and aid of the Indian nations. The Crown of England never attempted to interfere with the national affairs of the Indians further than to keep out the agents of foreign powers who might seduce them into foreign alliances. The English Government purchased the alliance and dependence of the Indian Nations by subsidies, and purchased their lands when they were willing to sell at a price they were willing to take, but they never coerced a surrender of them. The English Government considered them as nations competent to maintain the relations of peace and war and of governing themselves under her protection. The United States, who succeeded to the rights of the British Crown in respect of the Indians, did the same and no more; and the protection stipulated to be afforded to the Indians and claimed by them was understood by all parties as only binding the Indians to the United States as dependent allies.\nAgain the same learned writer says;\nThe original Indian Nations were regarded and dealt with as proprietors of the soil which they claimed and occupied, but without the power of alienation, except to the Governments which protected them and had thrown over them and beyond them their assumed patented domains. These Governments asserted and enforced the exclusive right to extinguish Indian titles to lands, enclosed within the exterior lines of their jurisdictions, by fair purchase, under the sanction of treaties; and they held all individual purchases from the Indians, whether made with them individually or collectively as tribes, to be absolutely null and void. The only power that could lawfully acquire the Indian title was the State, and a government grant was the only lawful source of title admitted in the Courts of Justice. The Colonial and State Governments and the government of the United States uniformly dealt upon these principles with the Indian Nations dwelling within their territorial limits.\nFurther, Chancellor Kent, in summarising the decision of the Supreme Court in Mitchell v. United States, states the whole doctrine in a form still more applicable to the present case. He says:\nThe Supreme Court once more declared the same general doctrine, that lands in possession of friendly Indians were always, under the colonial governments, considered as being owned by the tribe or nation as their common property by a perpetual right of possession; but that the ultimate fee was in the crown or its grantees, subject to this right of possession, and could be granted by the crown upon that condition; that individuals could not purchase Indian lands without license, or under rules prescribed by law; that possession was considered with reference to Indian habits and modes of life, and the hunting grounds of the tribes were as much in their actual occupation as the cleared fields of the whites, and this was the tenure of Indian lands by the laws of all the colonies.\nIt thus appears, that in the United States a traditional policy, derived from colonial times, relative to the Indians and their lands has ripened into well established rules of law, and that the result is that the lands in the possession of the Indians are, until surrendered, treated as their rightful though inalienable property, so far as the possession and enjoyment are concerned; in other words, that the dominium utile is recognized as belonging to or reserved for the Indians, though the dominium directum is considered to be in the United States. Then, if this is so as regards Indian lands in the United States, which have been preserved to the Indians by the constant observance of a particular rule of policy acknowledged by the United States courts to have been originally enforced by the crown of Great Britain, how is it possible to suppose that the law can, or rather could have been, at the date of confederation, in a state any less favorable to the Indians whose lands were situated within the dominion of the British crown, the original author of this beneficent doctrine so carefully adhered to in the United States from the days of the colonial governments? Therefore, when we consider that with reference to Canada the uniform practice has always been to recognize the Indian title as one which could only be dealt with by surrender to the crown, I maintain that if there had been an entire absence of any written legislative act ordaining this rule as an express positive law, we ought, just as the United States courts have done, to hold that it nevertheless existed as a rule of the unwritten common law, which the courts were bound to enforce as such, and consequently, that the 24th sub-section of section 91, as well as the 109th section and the 5th sub-section of section 92 of the British North America Act, must all be read and construed upon the assumption that these territorial rights of the Indians were strictly legal rights which had to be taken into account and dealt with in that distribution of property and proprietary rights made upon confederation between the federal and provincial governments.\n[…]\nTo summarize these arguments, which appear to me to possess great force, we find, that at the date of confederation the Indians, by the constant usage and practice of the crown, were considered to possess a certain proprietary interest in the unsurrendered lands which they occupied as hunting grounds; that this usage had either ripened into a rule of the common law as applicable to the American Colonies, or that such a rule had been derived from the law of nations and had in this way been imported into the Colonial law as applied to Indian Nations; that such property of the Indians was usufructuary only and could not be alienated, except by surrender to the crown as the ultimate owner of the soil; and that these rights of property were not inaptly described by the words “lands reserved for the Indians,” whilst they could not, without doing violence to the meaning of language, be comprised in the description of public lands which the Provinces could sell and dispose of at their will.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nJudicial Committee of the Privy Council # Lord Watson # [\u0026hellip;]\nThe territory in dispute has been in Indian occupation from the date of the proclamation until 1873. During that interval of time Indian affairs have been administered successively by the Crown, by the Provincial Governments, and (since the passing of the British North America Act, 1867), by the Government of the Dominion. The policy of these administrations has been all along the same in this respect, that the Indian inhabitants have been precluded from entering into any transaction with a subject for the sale or transfer of their interest in the land, and have only been permitted to surrender their rights to the Crown by a formal contract, duly ratified in a meeting of their chiefs or headmen convened for the purpose. Whilst there have been changes in the administrative authority, there has been no change since the year 1763 in the character of the interest which its Indian inhabitants had in the lands surrendered by the treaty. Their possession, such as it was, can only be ascribed to the general provisions made by the royal proclamation in favour of all Indian tribes then living under the sovereignty and protection of the British Crown. It was suggested in the course of the argument for the Dominion, that inasmuch as the proclamation recites that the territories thereby reserved for Indians had never “been ceded to or purchased by” the Crown, the entire property of the land remained with them. That inference is, however, at variance with the terms of the instrument, which shew that the tenure of the Indians was a personal and usufructuary right, dependent upon the good will of the Sovereign. The lands reserved are expressly stated to be “parts of the dominions and territories;” and it is declared to be the will and pleasure of the sovereign that, “for the present,” they shall be reserved for the use of the Indians, as their hunting grounds, under his protection and dominion. There was a great deal of learned discussion at the Bar with respect to the precise quality of the Indian right, but their Lordships do not consider it necessary to express any opinion upon the point. It appears to them to be sufficient for the purposes of this case that there has been all along vested in the Crown a substantial and paramount estate, underlying the Indian title, which became a plenum dominium whenever that title was surrendered or otherwise extinguished.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThe enactment of sec. 109 are, in the opinion of their Lordships, sufficient to give to each Province, subject to the administration and control of its own Legislature, the entire beneficial interest of the Crown in all lands within its boundaries, which at the time of the union were vested in the Crown, with the exception of such lands as the Dominion acquired right to under sec. 108, or might assume for the purposes specified in sec. 117. Its legal affect is to exclude from the “duties and revenues” appropriated to the Dominion, all the ordinary territorial revenues of the Crown arising within the Province. That construction of the statute was accepted by this Board in deciding Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer, 8 App. Cas. 767, where the controversy related to land granted in fee simple to a subject before 1867, which became eshceat to the Crown in the years 1871. The Lord Chancellor (Earl Selbourne) in delivering judgment in that case, said, 8 App. Cas. 776: “It was not disputed, in the argument for the Dominion at the bar, that all territorial revenues arising within each Province from ‘lands’ (in which term must be comprehended all estates in land), which at the time of the union belonged to the Crown, were reserved to the respective Provinces by sec. 109; and it was admitted that no distinction could, in that respect, be made between lands then ungranted, and lands which had previously reverted to the Crown by escheat. But it was insisted that a line was drawn at the date of the union, and that the words were not sufficiant to reserve any lands afterwards escheated which at the time of the union were in private hands, and did not then belong to the Crown. Their Lordships indicated an opinion to the effect that the escheat would not, in the special circumstances of that case, have passed to the Province as “lands;” but they held that it fell within the class of rights reserved to the Provinces as “royalities” by sec. 109.\nHad its Indian inhabitants been the owners in fee simple of the territory which they surrendered by the treaty of 1873, Attorney-General of Ontario v. Mercer, 8 App. Cas. 767, might have been an authority for holding that the Province of Ontario could derive no benefit from the cession, in respect that the land was not vested in the Crown at the time of the union. But that was not the character of the Indian interest. The Crown has all along had a present proprietary estate in the land, upon which the Indian title was a mere burden. The ceded territory was at the time of the union, land vested in the Crown, subject to “an interest other than that of the Province in the same,” within the interest other than that of meaning of sec. 109; and must now belong to Ontario in terms of that clause, unless its rights have been taken away by some provision of the Act of 1867 other than those already noticed.\nIn the course of the argument the claim of the Dominion to the ceded territory was rested upon the provisions of sec. 91 (24), which in express terms confer upon the Parliament of Canada power to make laws for “Indians, and lands reserved for the Indians.” It was urged that the exclusive power of legislation and administration carried with it, by necessary implication, any patrimonial interest which the Crown might have had in the reserved lands. In reply to that reasoning, counsel for Ontario referred us to a series of provincial statutes prior in date to the Act of 1867, for the purpose of shewing that the expression “Indian reserves” was used in legislature language to designate certain lands in which the Indians had, after the royal proclamation of 1763, acquired a special interest, by treaty or otherwise, and did not apply to land occupied by them in virtue of the proclamation. The argument might have deserved consideration if the expression had been adopted by the British Parliament in 1867, but it does not occur in sec. 91 (24), and the words actually used are, according to their natural meaning, sufficient to include all lands reserved, upon any terms or conditions, for Indian occupation. It appears to be the plain policy of the Act that, in order to ensure uniformity of administration, all such lands, and Indian affairs generally, shall be under the legislative control of one central authority.\nTheir Lordships are, however, unable to assent to the argument for the Dominion founded on sec. 92 (24). There can be no a priori probability that the British Legislature, in a branch of the statute which professes to deal only with the distribution of legislative power, intended to deprive the Province of rights which are expressly given them in that branch of it which relates to the distribution of revenues and assets. The fact that the power of legislating for Indians, and for lands which are reserved to their use, has been intrusted to the Parliament of the Dominion is not in the least degree inconsistent with the right of the Provinces to them as a source of revenue whenever the estate of the Crown is disencumbered of the Indian title.\nBy the treaty of 1873 the Indian inhabitants ceded and released the territory in dispute, in order that it might be opened up for settlement, immigration, and such other purpose as to Her Majesty might seem fit, “to the Government of the Dominion of Canada,” for the Queen and Her successors for ever. It was argued that a cession in these terms was in effect a conveyance to the Dominion Government of the whole rights of the Indians, with the consent of the Crown. That is not the natural import of the language of the treaty, which purports to be from beginning to end a transaction between the Indians and the Crown. Even if its language had been more favourable to the argument of the Dominion upon this point, it is abundantly clear that the commissioners who represented Her Majesty, whilst they had full authority to accept a surrender to the Crown, had neither authority nor power to take away from Ontario the interest which had been assigned to the province by the Imperial Statute of 1867.\nThese considerations appear to their Lordships to be sufficient for the disposal of this appeal. The treaty leaves the Indians no right whatever to the timber growing upon the lands which they gave up, which is now fully vested in the Crown, all revenues derivable from the sale of such portions of it as are situate within the boundaries of Ontario being the property of that Province. The fact, that it still possesses exclusive power to regulate the Indian’s privilege of hunting and fishing, cannot confer upon the Dominion power of dispose, by issuing permits or otherwise, of that beneficial interest in the timber which has now passed to Ontario. Seeing that the benefit of the surrender accrues to her, Ontario must, of course, relieve the Crown, and the Dominion, of all obligations involving the payment of money which were undertaken by Her Majesty, and which are said to have been in part fulfilled by the Dominion Government. There may be other questions behind, with respect to the right to determine to what extent, and at what periods, the disputed territory, over which the Indians still exercise their avocations of hunting and fishing, is to be taken up for settlement or other purposes, but none of these questions are raised for decision in the present suit.\nTheir Lordships will therefore humbly advise Her Majesty that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada ought to be affirmed, and the appeal dismissed. It appears to them that there ought to be no costs of the appeal.\nKent McNeil, Flawed Precedent: the St. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s case and Aboriginal title (Vancouver: UBC Press, 2019), 8.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIbid., 9.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":175,"href":"/casebook/title/stuartburn/","title":"Stuartburn (Municipality) v Kiansky","section":"Chapter 3","content":" Wright J. — # This is an application by the Rural Municipality of Stuartburn (”the Municipality”) for a declaration that its Reeve, the respondent David Theodore Kiansky (”Kiansky”) is disqualified from holding office.\nThe Municipality alleges Kiansky does not meet the election requirements as set forth in The Municipal Act, S.M. 1996, c. 58 - Chap. M225 and The Local Authorities Election Act, R.S.M. 1987, c. L180 (”the LAE Act”).\nThe Municipal Act establishes that eligibility for election includes the requirement the person must be an elector of the Municipality. If a person ceases to be qualified as an elector, he/she thereupon is disqualified from continuing in office. Once disqualified, the person cannot be re-elected, even though he/she becomes qualified again, until the next general election in the Municipality.\nThe LAE Act governs the eligibility to be an elector. “Elector” is defined as “a person qualified to vote at an election of members of a council”. Section 5(1) of the LAE Act spells out the qualifications for voting and being named in the list of electors, as follows:\nQualification of electors\n5(1) Subject to this Act, the right to have his name placed upon the list of electors of, and to vote at elections in, local authorities belongs to each of the following persons; that is to say, a person who\n(a) is a Canadian citizen of the full age of 18 years, or who will be 18 years of age at the date of the election, and is not disqualified under this Act, or otherwise by law prohibited, from voting; and\n(b) is an actual resident in the authority and will have been resident therein for a period of six months at the date of the election;\nand, in the case of elections in a municipality, the right of being named in the list of electors and of voting also belongs to any person who is qualified as provided in clause (a) and who, whether resident in the authority or not, is, in his own right, at the date of the election,\n(c) an owner of land which is assessed in the latest revised realty assessment roll; or\n(d) a tenant or occupier of land whose name is entered on the latest revised realty assessment roll as the owner of a right, interest or estate in the land.\nKiansky was first elected Reeve in October 1995. He was re-elected in 1998. Until July 31, 2000 it is not disputed that he met the necessary requirements for office, including both ownership of land and residence in the Municipality. However, on that date he moved out of the Municipality and sold his home and related land. The Municipality says that when this occurred Kiansky no longer met either the residency or property qualifications for Reeve and became disqualified.\nKiansky does not deny that he sold his home and related land and moved out of the Municipality as the Municipality says, but he contests the claim he was then disqualified from being an elector. He relies on the fact that when he moved from the Municipality he was the holder of a remainder interest in other real property in the Municipality expectant on the death of his grandmother, Mary Kiansky, who held the life interest. Kiansky argues that pursuant to s. 5(1) he retained “the right of being named in the list of electors and of voting” because he, “whether resident in the authority or not”, was “in his own right, at the date of the election, . . . (c) an owner of land which is assessed in the latest revised realty assessment roll”.\nThe subject land is a quarter section of real property in the Municipality. At all material times Kiansky was recorded in the land titles office in relation to this land as “registered owner of an estate in remainder expectant upon the decease of Mary Kiansky of Vita, Manitoba …“. Mary Kiansky herself was recorded as “registered owner of a life estate during the term of her natural life … “.\nThe land is and was assessed in the latest revised realty assessment roll.\nThe first issue then on the application is whether Kiansky’s remainderman interest is sufficient to classify him as “an owner of land” despite the sale of his residence property and move from the Municipality. The exact phraseology in s. 5(1) is “is, in his own right \u0026hellip; an owner of land . . . “. These words have to be considered in the context of the meaning of “owner” and the nature of the remainder interest.\n”Owner” is defined in the LAE Act to mean (in part) “subject as herein otherwise provided, a person who is an owner of a freehold estate in land in a local authority . . . “ (which includes a municipality).\nFor the purposes of a municipality only and relative to eligibility to be on the Municipal electors list, the meaning of “owner” is expanded by s. 5(2)(a) of the LAE Act to include a person who “has acquired, by purchase under agreement for sale or otherwise, an estate or interest in land … “.\nIn my opinion, this expanded definition has no application to the circumstances now before me. I interpret the wording to intend that the acquisition mentioned must have arisen by a purchase by some means. If acquisition other than by purchase was the purpose of s. 5(2)(a), there would be no need for insertion of the words “by purchase under agreement for sale or otherwise”. The provision probably should be read in the context of s. 5(6) which deals with the entitlement of a purchaser of an owner’s interest in land to be placed on the list of electors. In the present case it is not suggested Kiansky obtained his remainder interest by purchase. Rather, the inference more reasonably can be made that this benefit was obtained by inheritance or by gift, inter vivos, but not by purchase.\nIf the expanded definition of ownership does not apply, then we are left with the base or primary definition which, as noted, describes an “owner” as a person who “is an owner of a freehold estate in land” in the Municipality.\nI take this definition, in the context of the wording of s. 5(1), to mean the person must be the present owner of a freehold estate in land. The ownership must be of a currently existing freehold estate. In the case of Kiansky this means that his remainder interest must be capable of identification as a freehold estate owned by him at the same time as his grandmother was exercising her rights in respect of the life estate.\nWhat then is a freehold estate?\nFreehold is a measure of the nature and degree of a person’s interest in land. It includes a life interest and a fee simple. Both are for an indeterminate period. The life interest will expire on the death of the owner (or tenant as it is often termed). The fee simple may be inherited.\nAt common law, both the life interest and the fee simple could be alienated but any disposition was subject to the limitations of the freehold. The fee simple interest is the broadest freehold.\nThe word “estate”, when used in conjunction with “freehold” can be thought of as synonymous with the words “right”, “title” and “interest” [Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed.), p. 547]. Thus, freehold estate can be interpreted to mean a freehold right, title, or interest in land.\nThe nature of Kiansky’s remainder interest is of a right to a freehold interest in fee simple. This can also be described as a right to a freehold estate in fee simple.\nMost importantly, the remainder interest is a present right. It co-exists with the life estate even though enjoyment and possession of the real property is postponed until termination of the life interest. This arises from the common law requirement that there could be no abeyance of seisin; that is, that there could be no abeyance of the ownership or transfer of the ownership of the freehold interest if the transfer was to be effective. Therefore, an instant vesting took place. Thus, as in the present circumstances, a grant of a life estate to one person with the remainder in fee simple to another, was and remains a grant to each effective as of the time of the grant. Seisin did not require actual possession, although it did require possession in the sense of title or ownership.\nSupport for these legal interpretations can be found in Anger and Honsberger Real Property, Vol. 1 (2nd ed., 1985), and in particular from the following passages from that text:\nThe doctrine of estates is one of the most remarkable and enduring in the history of English land law. The term “estate” is probably derived from status, for in a landholding society the relationship one had to one’s land no doubt defined one’s standing in the community. Later, however, the term “estate” described the quantity of a person’s interest in land. The concept of the estate is unique to English law. It is an abstraction, interposed between the tenant and the land so that a person does not own the land itself absolutely or allodially as in the civil law. Indeed, he cannot own the land for the Crown owns it. Instead, he owns an estate or interest in the land. Furthermore, it is the concept of seisin which links the abstract concept of the estate with the physical thing, the land. The person who has the seisin, or who is entitled to it in the future, has an estate in the land. Moreover, the idea of estates, as distinct from ownership of land, makes possible the fragmentation of ownership among different persons in succession. Thus, for example, land may be granted “to A for life, then to B in tail, remainder to C in fee simple”. In this example all three persons have estates in the land and they exist in the present, that is, they are capable of present ownership. The latter is a precondition of an estate. Even though the seisin rests in A only for the time being, the ownership of B and C also exists in the present. [p. 26-27]\n. . . An estate is an abstract concept distinct from the land itself. In essence, the word describes the rights a person may have in land for a period of time. The quantum of the estate thus varies with time. The largest estate possible is the fee simple. In theory it may last forever, being passed on by transfer or succession. It ends only when the owner of it dies intestate without an heir. In that event it passes to the Crown. It may be carved up into lesser estates, namely, the fee tail, which lasts only so long as the direct descendants of the original tenant in tail survive, and the life estate which lasts for the duration of the life specified. These three estates are known as estate of freehold and they are thus distinguishable from leaseholds. … [p. 11]\nThese several estates may exist in possession, in remainder, or in reversion. The first of these terms is self-explanatory. When X is entitled to an immediate life estate he is entitled to enjoy it in possession. An estate in remainder is created when a person is given an estate but he is not entitled to possession until the expiration of a prior estate created by the same instrument. An estate in reversion is the estate retained by the grantor when he conveys away a lesser estate. Thus, in a conveyance by G to “A for life and then to B in fee tail”, A has a life estate in possession, B has an estate in fee tail in remainder and G retains an estate in fee simple in reversion. Moreover, these estates are said to be vested in that they are presently existing, even though the owners are not all immediately entitled to possession. Vested thus normally means “vested in interest” and not “vested in possession”. … [pp. 11-12]\nIn other words, a remainder limited to take effect automatically upon the expiration of the prior particular estate is a vested remainder because a present estate is conferred although it is not to be enjoyed until that future time. … [p. 395]\nA future interest is an interest in property in which the right to possession or enjoyment of the property is postponed to a future time. Nevertheless, it is a presently existing interest in the property and it is thus part of the total ownership of the property. … [p. 335]\n… at common law, livery of seisin was necessary to grant any freehold estate and the freehold could never be in abeyance, for there had to be someone at all times to perform the feudal services and against whom actions could be brought. … [p. 392]\nCounsel for the Municipality referred to a tax publication, Goodman on Estate Planning (Vol. V, No. 3, 1996), and on a ruling of the Canada Income Tax Directorate, both of which contain statements that appear to accept the proposition a legal remainder interest in real property is not a freehold interest. It will be evident from my above reasons that I am not in accord with any such opinions. I do note, for what it is worth, that Dr. Goodman, in his commentary, does support my conclusion that a remainder interest in real property reflects an ownership interest, when he states:\n… The owner of a remainder interest in real property, whose right of possession is deferred until the termination of the preceding life interest, is just as much an owner as someone who has a freehold interest. … [p. 328]\nFor all the reasons above expressed, the conclusion I have reached, therefore, is that Kiansky’s remainder interest allows him to be classified as a present owner of a freehold estate in the Municipality. This meets the requirement of s. 5(1) of the L.A.E.

An answer to the question is often fundamental to resolving a dispute in court or convincing a political decision-maker to make some kind of legal or policy change.\nOne way to answer this question is to focus on \u0026ldquo;style\u0026rdquo;.1 This idea of style will seem pretty wishy-washy to some people at first. Aren\u0026rsquo;t legal arguments clear, logical, and rational? Knowing enough about the law and the facts, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we always be able to determine the correct legal answer to a problem?\nThe reality is that legal arguments in Anglo-Canadian legal systems\u0026ndash;the common law in particular\u0026ndash;are very highly patterned.2 This makes the structure of those arguments\u0026ndash;though not necessarily the outcome of the arguments\u0026ndash;fairly predictable. Patterns of legal argument recur again and again in the cases and other materials we will read this year. Becoming proficient in making and using these arguments means being able to recognize and make use of these different patterns.\nFor example, in a legal dispute, one party might argue:\nPlaintiff has a right to do X (such as, exclude other people from their property).\nThe other party might respond:\nTrue, but these facts justify a limitation on plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s right to do X in the circumstances (such as, authorization to be on land for certain purposes).\nThe basic structure of this argument (\u0026ldquo;I have a right to do X\u0026rdquo; / \u0026ldquo;Your right is limited in this context\u0026rdquo;) is one that you will across a whole range of different disputes and areas of law. We could list other examples of different argument types, and probably develop a sensible system to label and classifying them.\nThe problem is that, more often than not, there is no obvious way to resolve which side of the argument is \u0026ldquo;correct\u0026rdquo;. One claim is met with a counter-claim, which in turn is met by another claim and its predictable, patterned response. And on and on. Both sides appears to have legal merit.\nIn the end we need something more than just these basic patterns of call-and-response to answer the question of makes a good or persuasive legal argument. This is the role of historically-situated styles of Anglo-Canadian legal reasoning, which are constituted by the different assumptions and modes of rhetoric employed by different jurists over time.\nA good way to think about all this is by way of analogy to language.3 Learning to speak a new language requires you to learn a whole new set of words that make up the language—i.e., its vocabulary. But to actually learn to use the language, you need to learn not only its vocabulary but also its grammatical structure—i.e., how the words fit together to form coherent thoughts expressed in that linguistic context.\nThe recurring forms of legal argument and counter-argument your will learn to recognize are the basic units of Anglo-Canadian legal vocabulary. Styles of legal argument refer to how this vocabulary is used according to the system\u0026rsquo;s deeper grammatical structure to engage in positions or perspectives that seem more or less persuasive to their audience(s).\nJustin Desautels-Stein, The Jurisprudence of Style:A Structuralist History of American Pragmatism and Liberal Legal Thought (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2018).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nDuncan Kennedy, \u0026ldquo;A semiotics of legal argument\u0026rdquo; (1991) 42 Syracuse Law Review 75.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nJustin Desautels-Stein, \u0026ldquo;The property course as critique\u0026rdquo;, Law and Political Economy Project (2018): https://lpeproject.org/blog/the-property-course-as-critique/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"},{"id":177,"href":"/casebook/title/tenure/","title":"Tenure and Estates","section":"Chapter 3","content":"According to the common law doctrine of tenure all land under the dominion of the English crown is held “mediately or immediately, of the king”—that is, the crown has “radical title” to all land under its political dominion. William the Conqueror declared that all land in England was literally the king’s property; everyone else had to settle for the privilege of holding it for him—the privilege of tenure (from the Norman French word “tenir”—to hold). Tenurial rights were intensely personal in early feudal society: the right to hold land was a privilege granted by the crown in exchange for an oath of allegiance and a promise of military service by the tenant—the oath of homage. The word homage derives from the French word homme—literally “man”—precisely because the ceremony surrounding the oath created not only the right of tenure, but a political and military relationship between “lord and man.” In exchange for the tenant’s loyal support, or fealty, the lord warranted the tenant’s right to hold a plot of land, called a fief, or fee.\nAcceptance of this form of military tenure obligated the tenant to provide a certain number of knights when called on by the king, and the land held by the tenant was supposed to provide sufficient material support to enable him to meet this military obligation. Sometimes, by the process of subinfeudation, the King’s direct tenants (or “tenants-in-chief”) could spread this burden around by in turn accepting homage from other, lesser nobles and freemen, each of whom would be responsible to the tenant-in-chief for a portion of the tenant-in-chief’s obligation to provide knight-service. The tenants-in-chief thereby became “mesne lords” in their own right (“mesne” being Norman French for “middle” or “intermediate”). There could be several layers of mesne lords (i.e., “land lords”) in the feudal hierarchy, at the bottom of which were “tenants in demesne” (“demesne” being Norman French for “domain” or “dominion”)—who actually held the land rather than subinfeudating it further. Of course, holding land did not mean one actually worked it; a tenant in demesne often left the cultivation and productive use of land to those of lower social status. These could be “villeins”—serfs legally bound to the land by birth—or “leasehold” tenants—a leasehold being a right to hold land for a term of years in exchange for payment of rent in cash or (more often) kind, and of lesser status than the “freehold” estate held by feudal tenants tracing their rights up the feudal pyramid to the crown.\nBecause a feudal tenant’s land rights were intimately connected to this web of personal, political, and military relationships, there was no logical reason why the tenant ought to be free to transfer those rights to anyone else—and good reason for the lords to resist such alienation of the fee by their tenants. Indeed, fees could be forfeited to the lord for the tenant’s breach of the homage relationship or commission of some other “felony,” and on the tenant’s death it was not clear that his family members had the right to inherit the fee. The king was assumed to have the right to retake the fee and re-grant it to a preferable new tenant upon his displeasure with or the death of the old tenant (it was his land, after all). Within a century, however, the dynastic ambitions of the baronage compelled King Henry I to concede (in his Coronation Charter of 1100) that a recently deceased baron’s heir could redeem his fee upon payment of “a just and lawful relief”—i.e., a payment of money to the crown, as a kind of inheritance tax. Under the principle of primogeniture that took hold in England around this time, the lord’s heir was his eldest son; landowners were not free to choose who would take over their tenancy after their death. Thus, subject to the payment of a relief, the fee became descendible—capable of being inherited from one generation to the next—and the grant of a descendible tenancy by the crown was now made not “to Lord Hobnob,” but “to Lord Hobnob and his heirs.” To this day, the latter phrase remains the classic common-law formula for creating the broadest interest in land that the law will recognize: the fee simple absolute.\nDescendibility of the fee simple having been settled early in the history of English land law, the broader question of full alienability took several more centuries to work out. The history of medieval English land law is a history of tenants trying to secure their families’ wealth and power by expanding alienability and evading tenurial obligations to their lords and the crown, while the crown and higher nobility tried to adapt the law to preserve their status and prevent such evasions. There is a dialectical quality to this history. For example: for complicated reasons subinfeudation quickly came to present a greater threat to the economic interests of the higher ranks of the feudal hierarchy than simple substitution of one tenant for another. Thus, in 1290 the Statute of Quia Emptores banned subinfeudation. But in doing so it validated substitution, and with it the practice of selling an entire fee in exchange for money during the life of the tenant. Similarly, in 1536, at the insistence of King Henry VIII, the Statute of Uses abolished many clever schemes adopted by tenants to use intermediaries to direct the disposition of real property interests after death and to put those interests outside the reach of the law courts (and of the crown’s feudal authority). But in doing so, the statute validated one type of flexible property arrangement we have come to know as a trust. Moreover, the removal of the primary mechanism lawyers had developed to meet tenants’ demand for intergenerational planning was sufficiently unpopular that Henry felt compelled to consent to the enactment of the Statute of Wills in 1540—finally permitting tenants to pass their legal estates in land by will rather than being at the whim of the rule of primogeniture. Finally, since the 16th century, primogeniture has given way to a more complex system of default inheritance rights for various relatives of the deceased who leaves no will; these rights are designed to try to approximate what legislatures think the decedent would have wanted, not necessarily what is best for the government. This set of default rights comprises the law of intestate succession.\nVarious other statutes and common-law developments over the centuries culminated in the system of possessory estates and future interests that were imported into the North American English colonies, and thus into the independent American states (excluding Louisiana). Underlying them all is a fundamental distinction that traces back to the “radical title” asserted by William the Conqueror in 1066: there is a conceptual difference between the ownership of land and the ownership of a legal interest in that land.\n"},{"id":178,"href":"/casebook/relationships/terra-nullius/","title":"Terra Nullius","section":"Chapter 1","content":"Terra nullius is a term that refers to a “territory without a master.” It is a term used in public international law to describe a space that can be inhabited but that does not belong to a state, meaning the land is not owned by anyone. In fact, when a State or an entity describes a land as a terra nullius, the land is in reality occupied – by a nation or a minority – but the term has oftentimes been used in order to legitimize state occupation and colonization.

We are studying what we shall want in order to appear before judges, or to advise people in such a way as to keep them out of court. The reason why it is a profession, why people will pay lawyers to argue for them or to advise them, is that in societies like ours the command of the public force is intrusted to the judges in certain cases, and the whole power of the state will be put forth, if necessary, to carry out their judgments and decrees. People want to know under what circumstances and how far they will run the risk of coming against what is so much stronger than themselves, and hence it becomes a business to find out when this danger is to be feared. The object of our study, then, is prediction, the prediction of the incidence of the public force through the instrumentality of the courts.\nThe means of the study are a body of reports, of treatises, and of statutes, in this country and in England, extending back for six hundred years, and now increasing annually by hundreds. In these sibylline leaves are gathered the scattered prophecies of the past upon the cases in which the axe will fall. These are what properly have been called the oracles of the law. Far the most important and pretty nearly the whole meaning of every new effort of legal thought is to make these prophecies more precise, and to generalize them into a thoroughly connected system. The process is one, from a lawyer\u0026rsquo;s statement of a case, eliminating as it does all the dramatic elements with which his client\u0026rsquo;s story has clothed it, and retaining only the facts of legal import, up to the final analyses and abstract universals of theoretic jurisprudence. The reason why a lawyer does not mention that his client wore a white hat when he made a contract, while Mrs. Quickly would be sure to dwell upon it along with the parcel gilt goblet and the sea-coal fire, is that he foresees that the public force will act in the same way whatever his client had upon his head. It is to make the prophecies easier to be remembered and to be understood that the teachings of the decisions of the past are put into general propositions and gathered into textbooks, or that statutes are passed in a general form. The primary rights and duties with which jurisprudence busies itself again are nothing but prophecies. One of the many evil effects of the confusion between legal and moral ideas, about which I shall have something to say in a moment, is that theory is apt to get the cart before the horse, and consider the right or the duty as something existing apart from and independent of the consequences of its breach, to which certain sanctions are added afterward. But, as I shall try to show, a legal duty so called is nothing but a prediction that if a man does or omits certain things he will be made to suffer in this or that way by judgment of the court; and so of a legal right.\nThe number of our predictions when generalized and reduced to a system is not unmanageably large. They present themselves as a finite body of dogma which may be mastered within a reasonable time. It is a great mistake to be frightened by the ever-increasing number of reports. The reports of a given jurisdiction in the course of a generation take up pretty much the whole body of the law, and restate it from the present point of view. We could reconstruct the corpus from them if all that went before were burned. The use of the earlier reports is mainly historical, a use about which I shall have something to say before I have finished.\nI wish, if I can, to lay down some first principles for the study of this body of dogma or systematized prediction which we call the law, for men who want to use it as the instrument of their business to enable them to prophesy in their turn, and, as bearing upon the study, I wish to point out an ideal which as yet our law has not attained.\nThe first thing for a businesslike understanding of the matter is to understand its limits, and therefore I think it desirable at once to point out and dispel a confusion between morality and law, which sometimes rises to the height of conscious theory, and more often and indeed constantly is making trouble in detail without reaching the point of consciousness. You can see very plainly that a bad man has as much reason as a good one for wishing to avoid an encounter with the public force, and therefore you can see the practical importance of the distinction between morality and law. A man who cares nothing for an ethical rule which is believed and practised by his neighbors is likely nevertheless to care a good deal to avoid being made to pay money, and will want to keep out of jail if he can.\nI take it for granted that no hearer of mine will misinterpret what I have to say as the language of cynicism. The law is the witness and external deposit of our moral life. Its history is the history of the moral development of the race. The practice of it, in spite of popular jests, tends to make good citizens and good men. When I emphasize the difference between law and morals I do so with reference to a single end, that of learning and understanding the law. For that purpose you must definitely master its specific marks, and it is for that that I ask you for the moment to imagine yourselves indifferent to other and greater things.\nI do not say that there is not a wider point of view from which the distinction between law and morals becomes of secondary or no importance, as all mathematical distinctions vanish in presence of the infinite. But I do say that that distinction is of the first importance for the object which we are here to consider — a right study and mastery of the law as a business with well understood limits, a body of dogma enclosed within definite lines. I have just shown the practical reason for saying so. If you want to know the law and nothing else, you must look at it as a bad man, who cares only for the material consequences which such knowledge enables him to predict, not as a good one, who finds his reasons for conduct, whether inside the law or outside of it, in the vaguer sanctions of conscience. The theoretical importance of the distinction is no less, if you would reason on your subject aright. The law is full of phraseology drawn from morals, and by the mere force of language continually invites us to pass from one domain to the other without perceiving it, as we are sure to do unless we have the boundary constantly before our minds. The law talks about rights, and duties, and malice, and intent, and negligence, and so forth, and nothing is easier, or, I may say, more common in legal reasoning, than to take these words in their moral sense, at some state of the argument, and so to drop into fallacy. For instance, when we speak of the rights of man in a moral sense, we mean to mark the limits of interference with individual freedom which we think are prescribed by conscience, or by our ideal, however reached. Yet it is certain that many laws have been enforced in the past, and it is likely that some are enforced now, which are condemned by the most enlightened opinion of the time, or which at all events pass the limit of interference, as many consciences would draw it. Manifestly, therefore, nothing but confusion of thought can result from assuming that the rights of man in a moral sense are equally rights in the sense of the Constitution and the law. No doubt simple and extreme cases can be put of imaginable laws which the statute-making power would not dare to enact, even in the absence of written constitutional prohibitions, because the community would rise in rebellion and fight; and this gives some plausibility to the proposition that the law, if not a part of morality, is limited by it. But this limit of power is not coextensive with any system of morals. For the most part it falls far within the lines of any such system, and in some cases may extend beyond them, for reasons drawn from the habits of a particular people at a particular time. I once heard the late Professor Agassiz say that a German population would rise if you added two cents to the price of a glass of beer. A statute in such a case would be empty words, not because it was wrong, but because it could not be enforced. No one will deny that wrong statutes can be and are enforced, and we would not all agree as to which were the wrong ones.\nThe confusion with which I am dealing besets confessedly legal conceptions. Take the fundamental question, What constitutes the law? You will find some text writers telling you that it is something different from what is decided by the courts of Massachusetts or England, that it is a system of reason, that it is a deduction from principles of ethics or admitted axioms or what not, which may or may not coincide with the decisions. But if we take the view of our friend the bad man we shall find that he does not care two straws for the axioms or deductions, but that he does want to know what the Massachusetts or English courts are likely to do in fact. I am much of this mind. The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law.\nTake again a notion which as popularly understood is the widest conception which the law contains — the notion of legal duty, to which already I have referred. We fill the word with all the content which we draw from morals. But what does it mean to a bad man? Mainly, and in the first place, a prophecy that if he does certain things he will be subjected to disagreeable consequences by way of imprisonment or compulsory payment of money. But from his point of view, what is the difference between being fined and taxed a certain sum for doing a certain thing? That his point of view is the test of legal principles is proven by the many discussions which have arisen in the courts on the very question whether a given statutory liability is a penalty or a tax. On the answer to this question depends the decision whether conduct is legally wrong or right, and also whether a man is under compulsion or free. Leaving the criminal law on one side, what is the difference between the liability under the mill acts or statutes authorizing a taking by eminent domain and the liability for what we call a wrongful conversion of property where restoration is out of the question. In both cases the party taking another man\u0026rsquo;s property has to pay its fair value as assessed by a jury, and no more. What significance is there in calling one taking right and another wrong from the point of view of the law? It does not matter, so far as the given consequence, the compulsory payment, is concerned, whether the act to which it is attached is described in terms of praise or in terms of blame, or whether the law purports to prohibit it or to allow it. If it matters at all, still speaking from the bad man\u0026rsquo;s point of view, it must be because in one case and not in the other some further disadvantages, or at least some further consequences, are attached to the act by law. The only other disadvantages thus attached to it which I ever have been able to think of are to be found in two somewhat insignificant legal doctrines, both of which might be abolished without much disturbance. One is, that a contract to do a prohibited act is unlawful, and the other, that, if one of two or more joint wrongdoers has to pay all the damages, he cannot recover contribution from his fellows. And that I believe is all. You see how the vague circumference of the notion of duty shrinks and at the same time grows more precise when we wash it with cynical acid and expel everything except the object of our study, the operations of the law.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSo much for the limits of the law. The next thing which I wish to consider is what are the forces which determine its content and its growth. You may assume, with Hobbes and Bentham and Austin, that all law emanates from the sovereign, even when the first human beings to enunciate it are the judges, or you may think that law is the voice of the Zeitgeist, or what you like. It is all one to my present purpose. Even if every decision required the sanction of an emperor with despotic power and a whimsical turn of mind, we should be interested none the less, still with a view to prediction, in discovering some order, some rational explanation, and some principle of growth for the rules which he laid down. In every system there are such explanations and principles to be found. It is with regard to them that a second fallacy comes in, which I think it important to expose.\nThe fallacy to which I refer is the notion that the only force at work in the development of the law is logic. In the broadest sense, indeed, that notion would be true. The postulate on which we think about the universe is that there is a fixed quantitative relation between every phenomenon and its antecedents and consequents. If there is such a thing as a phenomenon without these fixed quantitative relations, it is a miracle. It is outside the law of cause and effect, and as such transcends our power of thought, or at least is something to or from which we cannot reason. The condition of our thinking about the universe is that it is capable of being thought about rationally, or, in other words, that every part of it is effect and cause in the same sense in which those parts are with which we are most familiar. So in the broadest sense it is true that the law is a logical development, like everything else. The danger of which I speak is not the admission that the principles governing other phenomena also govern the law, but the notion that a given system, ours, for instance, can be worked out like mathematics from some general axioms of conduct. This is the natural error of the schools, but it is not confined to them. I once heard a very eminent judge say that he never let a decision go until he was absolutely sure that it was right. So judicial dissent often is blamed, as if it meant simply that one side or the other were not doing their sums right, and if they would take more trouble, agreement inevitably would come.\nThis mode of thinking is entirely natural. The training of lawyers is a training in logic. The processes of analogy, discrimination, and deduction are those in which they are most at home. The language of judicial decision is mainly the language of logic. And the logical method and form flatter that longing for certainty and for repose which is in every human mind. But certainty generally is illusion, and repose is not the destiny of man. Behind the logical form lies a judgment as to the relative worth and importance of competing legislative grounds, often an inarticulate and unconscious judgment, it is true, and yet the very root and nerve of the whole proceeding. You can give any conclusion a logical form. You always can imply a condition in a contract. But why do you imply it? It is because of some belief as to the practice of the community or of a class, or because of some opinion as to policy, or, in short, because of some attitude of yours upon a matter not capable of exact quantitative measurement, and therefore not capable of founding exact logical conclusions. Such matters really are battle grounds where the means do not exist for the determinations that shall be good for all time, and where the decision can do no more than embody the preference of a given body in a given time and place. We do not realize how large a part of our law is open to reconsideration upon a slight change in the habit of the public mind. No concrete proposition is self evident, no matter how ready we may be to accept it, not even Mr. Herbert Spencer\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Every man has a right to do what he wills, provided he interferes not with a like right on the part of his neighbors.\u0026rdquo;\n[\u0026hellip;]\nI think that the judges themselves have failed adequately to recognize their duty of weighing considerations of social advantage. The duty is inevitable, and the result of the often proclaimed judicial aversion to deal with such considerations is simply to leave the very ground and foundation of judgments inarticulate, and often unconscious, as I have said. When socialism first began to be talked about, the comfortable classes of the community were a good deal frightened. I suspect that this fear has influenced judicial action both here and in England, yet it is certain that it is not a conscious factor in the decisions to which I refer. I think that something similar has led people who no longer hope to control the legislatures to look to the courts as expounders of the constitutions, and that in some courts new principles have been discovered outside the bodies of those instruments, which may be generalized into acceptance of the economic doctrines which prevailed about fifty years ago, and a wholesale prohibition of what a tribunal of lawyers does not think about right. I cannot but believe that if the training of lawyers led them habitually to consider more definitely and explicitly the social advantage on which the rule they lay down must be justified, they sometimes would hesitate where now they are confident, and see that really they were taking sides upon debatable and often burning questions.\n"},{"id":181,"href":"/problems/halifax-right-to-shelter/","title":"The Right to Shelter in Halifax ","section":"Problems","content":"Our applied problem this week asks you to engage directly with events surrounding the right to shelter in Halifax over the past few years, including attempts by unhoused people to create shelters in public parks around the city during the pandemic and responses by neighbours, police, and the HRM Council.\nPlease start by reviewing the following sources:\nA CBC News article entitled What a B.C. court ruling could mean for Halifax park evictions, published soon after the British Columbia Supreme Court released its decision in Bamberger, below.\nThe most recent available statistics on homelessness in Halifax published by the Canadian Observatory on Homelessness.\nA new staff report submitted to the Regional Council describing the work and recommendations of the Lived Experience Advisory Committee on Homelessness for HRM.\nAfter reviewing these materials, ask yourself the following questions as you read the cases on the right to shelter below:\nHow might advocates challenge the legality of the park evictions that took place in Halifax during the summer of 2021?

Indeed, we do not outright reject the positive possibilities for communities taking over the management of reserve lands from the federal government and developing their own land management policies.\nHowever, it is important to analyze the First Nations Land Management Regime within the larger context of alienation from our traditional territories through market forces and colonial policies.\nIn our view, as treaty people, the threat of the First Nations Land Management Regime is that it overwrites our treaty history and obligations. Beyond this, for people whose nations do not have historical or contemporary treaties with the Crown, the threat of the politics of distraction is also at play in that we believe we should be having a larger, more robust conversation with the Crown regarding jurisdiction and management of lands and resources in Canada.\nIt is important to state at the outset that the Indian Act, the First Nations Land Management Act, and the Framework Agreement on First Nation Land Management make no substantive reference to treaties. This regime is about a very limited type of self governance and does not substantively implement the self-determination envisioned by our ancestors through treaty or inherent rights. This aforementioned point conforms to much government policy and was highlighted by The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples in 1996. The report stated that \u0026ldquo;it is almost as if Canada deliberately allowed itself to forget the principal constitutional mechanism by which the nation status of Indian communities is recognized in domestic law.\u0026rdquo; This includes the Numbered Treaties, the eleven agreements that span Ontario, the Plains and into B.C. and the Northwest Territories, negotiated between 1871 - 1921.\nOne of the goals of the Numbered Treaties, from an Indigenous perspective, is to protect Indigenous territories and livelihoods.\nHowever, we know that the hegemonic Canadian perspective of the Numbered Treaties (and all other treaties into the very recent present) is that they are land surrenders to the Crown. For those without agreements with the Crown, who refer to their land as \u0026lsquo;unceded\u0026rsquo;, the scope of this regime is obviously very limited.\nIn this report, we first review the political economy of the regime, since economic development is a major motivation for both First Nations and Canada.\nThough, we believe the current economic system we are working within will never provide robust freedom for Indigenous peoples, we also believe that we should not outright reject efforts to ensure fewer of our people live in poverty.\nSecond, since this report is meant to be a resource for communities, we critically examine the process of creating and ratifying a Land Code. Much of the criticism of FNLMA stems from the ratification process and whether it constitutes proper consent. Later we write about the implications of this regime for Treaty and non-Treaty First Nations, as well as the larger landscape of Indigenous governance in Canada.\nPolitical Economy of the First Nations Land Management Regime # Current and proposed Canadian legislation, including the voluntary First Nations Land Management Act and proposals for First Nations private property ownership, seek to alter the relationship communities have to their reserve land bases by offering a mechanism for First Nations to take over the \u0026rsquo;everyday\u0026rsquo; management of those lands. Under a community developed Land Code, First Nations are able to act at the \u0026ldquo;speed of business\u0026rdquo;, set terms for land related transactions, business licencing, zoning, and draft their own land management bylaws. This opens up reserve lands to further development (of course this is one of the main motivations for First Nations to enter the process). Currently, under the Indian Act, First Nations have to acquire permission from the Minister of Crown Indigenous Relations to allow commercial development of reserve lands. In a three-part review of the First Nations Land Management Regime, KPMG found that the Framework Agreement generates positive benefits for Canada, meaning that overall, the Regime has contributed to the Canadian economy.\nHowever, there are currently no studies that prove whether the First Nations Land Management Regime has reduced poverty on reserve or whether increased overall wealth of those First Nations has contributed to better socio-economic indicators, such as health, language renewal, or cultural revitalization.\nThrough the First Nations Land Management Regime, the federal government offloads fiscal, fiduciary, and environmental responsibilities and serves to benefit from the increased business capacity of First Nations. Though KPMG found that no First Nations that entered the process would choose to go back to land management under the Indian Act (which is not actually an option), First Nations who have ratified a Land Code have critiqued the cost and effort bore solely by the First Nation to develop land policies and laws, as well as higher insurance borne solely by First Nations to cover extended liabilities with regards to environmental management. Though the federal government is responsible for\nenvironmental damage and contamination that occurred before the transfer of land management, a First Nation assumes liability and responsibility for any environmental issues that occur after a Land Code takes effect.\nAdditionally, though First Nations receive funding to hire a land manager or other such staff to contribute to the development and enforcement of laws under the Land Code, including environmental assessment laws, these funding levels are set out in the Individual Agreement. Operational funding to support the implementation of a Land Code and corresponding laws is generally agreed to every five years for a fixed amount, so it is not guaranteed that a First Nation will always be able to access this funding or to what extent.\nWho Benefits from Reserve Marketization? # Ultimately, the aim of the First Nations Land Management Act is to put reserve land on the global market, subjecting communities to increased market forces. Under the Framework Agreement First Nations report an increase in businesses owned by external partners. The political ideology of neoliberalism, counter to the tenets of many traditional Indigenous economic philosophies, supports the deregulation of society through a consolidation of power and profit for corporations, over human, community needs (not to mention needs of the land). Some Indigenous scholars identify neoliberalism as a new form of colonization affecting Indigenous peoples, which can lead to increasing social inequality. Instead of the social, political, cultural, legal and economic spheres interacting in balance within a society, neoliberalism embeds those spheres in, and under, the economic sphere, and they are seen primarily through that lens.\nMany non-Indigenous scholars, however, advocate for neoliberal conceptions of capital accumulation and corresponding institutions of governance for Indigenous peoples as an answer to \u0026ldquo;undeveloped\u0026rdquo; economies. Tom Flanagan, for example, argues that Indigenous peoples' \u0026ldquo;problem\u0026rdquo; lies in a lack of private property and that \u0026ldquo;as quickly as possible, Indian bands should receive full ownership of their reserves, with the right to subdivide, mortgage, sell, and otherwise dispose of their assets, including buildings, lands, and all natural resources\u0026rdquo;. Similarly, Hernando De Soto articulates the need for private property systems in which private property rights are enforced. From this perspective, land can be used as collateral for economic enterprise. Manny Jules argues that Indigenous peoples historically had property rights, and so, others suggest a \u0026ldquo;reinstatement\u0026rdquo; of private property rights for First Nations would enable effective integration into the Canadian economy.\nSince the publication of Beyond the Indian Act: Restoring Aboriginal Property Rights, there have been few published Indigenous nation-specific rebuttals or suggested alternatives that account for a continuous relationship to territory. Flanagan\u0026rsquo;s main argument within that text is that First Nations must convert their reserve lands to fee-simple in order to reach economic independence. This led to the First Nations Property Ownership Proposal. In 2010, Neskie, Manuel and Emma Feltes wrote a rebuttal to the campaign for the First Nations Property Ownership Proposal arguing that it undermines the collective title held by First Nations people and would effectively result in extinguishment of title. In 2014, Shiri Pasternak argued that First Nations Property Ownership legislation was \u0026ldquo;discursively framed to acknowledge Indigenous land rights while the bill simultaneously introduces contentious measures to individualize and municipalize the quasi-communal land holding of reserves.\u0026rdquo; Though the First Nations Property Ownership legislation has not been introduced by the federal government, some of the same logics are at play in the First Nations Land Management Regime.\nWe have seen a shift to targeting individual First Nations, rather than blanket legislation when it comes to opening up reserve lands for development.\nIt is also important to understand the potential reasons why the federal government may be interested in the Regime. One reason could be related to rendering void the fiduciary responsibility that the federal government holds to First Nations related to the aspects included in the regime. A second reason could be to open up lands to market interests for more expedient resource development. Finally, the Framework Agreement has been shown to generate profits for Canada.\nIn a case study research project it was found that for five First Nation\u0026rsquo;s economic projects examined (which they called the \u0026ldquo;big winners\u0026rdquo;), the Framework Agreement provides profits to Canada of \u0026ldquo;between roughly $270 million and 1.4 billion\u0026rdquo; over the anticipated lifetime of the economic development project.\nThis increased revenue generated for Canada is due to First Nation\u0026rsquo;s ability to \u0026ldquo;work at the speed of business,\u0026rdquo; meaning it is easier for a First Nation to open businesses on-reserve, work with industry and forge business relationships with industry which lead to the development of reserve land.\nThe increased profits derived from reserve land eventually flow into the Canadian economy, thereby showing why Canada remains invested in removing barriers to business on-reserve. Study results show that First Nations operating within the First Nations Land Management Act report an increase in businesses owned by external partners. But, importantly, First Nations need to be aware of how the increase in market control may negatively impact their lands and nations.\nWe find ourselves at a similar juncture faced by First Nations people in the 1960\u0026rsquo;s: we are being forced to defend the arcane nature of the Indian Act in order to protect our current rights.\nIn 1969, the federal government authored the Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian Policy, which sought to effectively to abolish the Indian Act. In the Unjust Society, Harold Cardinal calls this a \u0026ldquo;thinly disguised programme of extermination through assimilation\u0026rdquo;.\nLimitations of Indian Act Settler Colonial Governance # It should be noted that it is band councils elected under the Indian Act that have the power to opt into the First Nations Land Management Regime. Though it is generally agreed upon that First Nations need to able to exert more jurisdiction and control over governance, we are being offered this increased control through an imposed governance system, since Canada generally accepts those bestowed power through the Indian Act as our official representatives. As we know, the Indian Act, 1876 had two main purposes, building on the Gradual Civilization and Enfranchisement Acts that came before it: 1) to assimilate First Nation individuals until they qualified for enfranchisement into the Canadian body politic; and 2) to force an exclusively male, British- style municipal type government onto First Nation communities. Additionally, the majority of chiefs and councillors elected under the Indian Act are men. Today, First Nations women are also more likely to be urban\u0026ndash;having been forced off reserve after successive discriminatory federal laws\u0026ndash;and therefore while they may be able to vote as band members to either accept or deny a Land Code put forward by their leadership, they serve to benefit less from economic activities on reserve.\nFinally, it is important to acknowledge that First Nations in Canada have a diversity of traditional and elected governance systems. Following arrests of Wet\u0026rsquo;suwet\u0026rsquo;en and supporters blocking pre- construction activities for the Coastal Gaslink pipeline, Trevor Jang writes \u0026ldquo;the band councils are responsible for managing reserve lands, while the hereditary system is what governed the broader traditional territory which is what the pipeline is proposed to cross.\u0026rdquo; Similarly, nêhiyaw scholar Sylvia McAdam writes that \u0026ldquo;The nêhiyawak believe the women have jurisdiction over land\nand water, which is contrary to the processes of land claims which are primarily male-dominated chiefs \u0026mdash; elected according to the imposed Indian Act\u0026rdquo;.\nGiven this state of affairs, there is an important point to make here: many First Nations who have implemented a Land Code tout the ability to create their own laws as a major benefit, but we question to what extent these reserve land management laws correspond to Indigenous legal systems.\nThis alienation of Indigenous peoples from those legal systems is wrapped up in the dynamics and logics of settler colonialism. We use the term settler-colonial to refer to the ongoing subjugation that Indigenous peoples face generally. Settler-colonial logic, related to the economy, is what Jobin refers to as a double-edged sword. The first edge is about control\u0026ndash;governing control. One may see this through the Indian Act, which legislates First Nations people and communities \u0026ldquo;from cradle to grave.\u0026rdquo; We may see gaining economic control as an important step towards independence in governance. What is often missed is the corresponding edge of the blade: that colonialism has also centred on disrupting and destroying Indigenous economies, and, specifically, relationships to land. The irony of this logic is that gaining more freedom from the Canadian government through the First Nations Land Management Regime or by opening up lands to the market through economic development, places Indigenous people under the governance of exploitative global capitalist markets. Boldt argues that the \u0026ldquo;reserve system was created to clear Indians out of the way of Canadian economic development\u0026rdquo;. The removal or alienation of Indigenous peoples from their full territories through the First Nations Land Management Regime or other processes that enable capitalist pursuits produces analogous results. It is clear that the First Nations Land Management Regime exists because of this logic.\nThe wealth disparity between First Nations people and settlers will only truly be resolved when we gain access and control over greater lands and resources.\n"},{"id":183,"href":"/casebook/title/adams-stangerross/","title":"The Unlawful Dispossession of Japanese Canadians","section":"Chapter 3","content":"While interning Japanese Canadians, the federal government seized control of all of their real and personal property within the \u0026ldquo;protected area in British Columbia.\u0026rdquo; In the spring of 1943, federal officials began to sell virtually everything that the government had taken, often below market value. Families lost heirlooms, vibrant businesses, and everyday possessions. They lost cars, boats, books, toys, furniture, and cameras. They lost homes and farms. Beyond the tangible, Canadians of Japanese descent lost opportunities, neighbourhoods, and communities. They lost connections to place. They lost retirements, livelihoods, and educations. They lost agency over their property and life choices. They lost, as Rikizo Yoneyama poignantly expressed in a defiant letter to the Minister of Justice, \u0026ldquo;more than just a home.\u0026rdquo; Japanese Canadians, he lamented, lost \u0026ldquo;the foundation of security and freedom as Canadian citizens.\u0026rdquo;\nThe sale of Japanese-Canadian-owned property was consistent with other moments in Canadian history when promises lost meaning as government interests shifted, officials\u0026rsquo; memories (conveniently) faded, and new legal interpretations of those promises took their place. The events chronicled here echo the federal government\u0026rsquo;s treaty promises to First Nations, which were backed by oral promises that officials later abandoned in favour of narrow legal interpretations\u0026mdash;with devastating consequences for Indigenous peoples.\nThe dispossession of Japanese Canadians is another instance in which the Crown created circumstances of dispossession coupled with a paternalistic promise of protection that it did not keep. When the federal government seized the property of Japanese Canadians, it made assurances in law, repeated by officials to Japanese Canadians on the doorsteps of their homes, that the property would be held as a \u0026ldquo;protective measure only\u0026rdquo; and would someday be returned. [\u0026hellip;]\nThe promise to protect property and its subsequent violation emerged out of the context of Canada at war. In the emergency federal cabinet meeting on 1 September 1939, following news that Germany had attacked Poland, Justice Minister and Acting Secretary of State, Ernest Lapointe, proclaimed an apprehended state of war and invoked the War Measures Act (WMA). As in the First World War, the WMA transferred virtually unlimited legislative authority to the federal cabinet. In the broad words of the Act: \u0026ldquo;The Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may \u0026hellip; deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada.\u0026rdquo; The Act specifically placed \u0026ldquo;appropriation, control, forfeiture and disposition of property\u0026rdquo; within federal executive control. In litigation arising out of the First World War, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council upheld the constitutionality of the WMA under the federal power to legislate for the \u0026ldquo;peace, order, and good government of Canada\u0026rdquo; in times of national crisis. As one government committee summarized, the Act granted \u0026ldquo;the Executive ample authority to take pretty well whatever action might be found to be necessary to meet the exigencies of war.\u0026rdquo;\nLong before the war in the Pacific, Japanese Canadians had been the subject of racist treatment under the law. In keeping with longstanding state hostility to Japanese Canadians, on 1 October 1940, the Cabinet War Committee established a \u0026ldquo;Special Committee on Orientals in British Columbia,\u0026rdquo; to keep \u0026ldquo;the Government constantly informed \u0026hellip; as to the oriental situation in that Province.\u0026rdquo; Hundreds of orders in council restricting the liberty of Japanese Canadians followed. The eventual dispossession, internment, incarceration, exile, and prohibitions on returning to British Columbia were all products of law: Orders in council drafted by a federal bureaucracy and approved by committees of cabinet. Following Canada\u0026rsquo;s declaration of war against Japan on 7 December 1941, the legal focus on Japanese Canadians intensified. A series of orders in council over the ensuing months enabled the uprooting and dispossession of all those living within the \u0026ldquo;protected area\u0026rdquo; of British Columbia, an enormous area of land covering the coast to 100 miles inland. As a precursor to the internment, in late February 1942, Order 1486 empowered the government to \u0026ldquo;require any and all persons to leave such protected area.\u0026rdquo; On 4 March 1942, Order 1665 put the internment policy into legal effect. Citing the necessity of \u0026ldquo;the security and defence of Canada,\u0026rdquo; the Order established the British Columbia Security Commission (BCSC), headquartered in Vancouver, \u0026ldquo;to plan, supervise and direct the evacuation from the protected areas of British Columbia of all persons of the Japanese race.\u0026rdquo; The uprooting and internment of Japanese Canadians created an immediate problem of what to do with the empty properties and vulnerable possessions of Japanese Canadians forced from their homes. The solution was for the Secretary of State, Norman McLarty, to take custody of seized property, and promise its protection. [\u0026hellip;]\nUnder the heading \u0026ldquo;Custody of Japanese Property,\u0026rdquo; Order 1665 provided as follows: 12.(1) As a protective measure only, all property situated in any protected area of British Columbia belonging to any person of the Japanese race resident in such area \u0026hellip; shall be vested in and subject to the control and management of the Custodian as defined in the Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1939; provided, however, that no commission shall be charged by the Custodian in respect of such control and management.\nSection [12(3)] concluded that the \u0026ldquo;property, rights and interests so vested in and subject to the control and management of the Custodian \u0026hellip; shall be dealt with in such manner as the Governor in Council may direct.\u0026rdquo;\n[\u0026hellip;]\nFacing internment, Japanese Canadians could see the precarious position of their property and they demanded its protection. Undersecretary of State Coleman realized that the promise of protection in Order 1665 was insufficient. On 16 March he explained to the Departments of Justice and External Affairs that \u0026ldquo;leaders in [the Japanese-Canadian] community\u0026rdquo; were \u0026ldquo;exercised\u0026rdquo; about the property situation and indicated that the BCSC regarded this as a matter of \u0026ldquo;importance and urgency.\u0026rdquo; He recommended an amendment to Order 1665, which included \u0026ldquo;dropping completely\u0026rdquo; the offending clause, 12(3). \u0026ldquo;I do not think,\u0026rdquo; wrote Coleman, \u0026ldquo;it was ever contemplated by the Government that they would deprive the Japanese owners of their property or the proceeds thereof.\u0026rdquo; The existing wording, however, left the law \u0026ldquo;susceptible of the interpretation that something in the nature of confiscation is taking place and I am sure,\u0026rdquo; he repeated, \u0026ldquo;this was not the intention of this Government.\u0026rdquo; Citing the necessity to encourage Japanese Canadians to register their property with the Custodian, and the \u0026ldquo;very heavy responsibilities\u0026rdquo; placed upon the BCSC, Coleman proposed a rewording of the law. The promise to protect emerged from a number of interests that, for the moment, intersected. One thread [\u0026hellip;] drew together a connection between the rights of British subjects, common law property rights, and rights of natural justice. Normative concerns for fairness were bolstered, however, by instrumental values that sought cooperation, administrative simplicity, and cost effectiveness in the implementation of the racialized internment and dispersal of Japanese Canadians. Coleman, for his part, made a pragmatic case. Japanese Canadians were \u0026ldquo;exercised\u0026rdquo; and their fears about the handling of their property jeopardized the activities of both the BCSC and the Custodian. His proposed amendments, which would take the form of Order 2483 on 27 March 1942, aimed to reassure Japanese Canadians and hence facilitate the work of the uprooting. And yet, his argument also conveyed something of Read\u0026rsquo;s view that confiscation would violate core principles of property rights. Coleman took for granted, at least rhetorically, that the government would not confiscate the property of British subjects. Almost a year later, Coleman and his supervisor, the Secretary of State, described a contemplated new Order that would force the sale of all Japanese-Canadian-owned property as a significant shift away from the protection envisioned in Order 2483.\nJust over three weeks after Order 1665 became law, the cabinet amended it with Order 2483. The preamble explained the reasons for the revisions, noting \u0026ldquo;that it is desirable to provide that any plan with regard to the placement of such persons be limited to making provision for the temporary placement only of such persons during the continuation of the state of war now existing.\u0026rdquo; The preamble also cited recommendations by the BCSC that \u0026ldquo;a greater degree of protective control over persons of the Japanese race and the property of such persons be provided for.\u0026rdquo; The substantive provisions stipulated the powers of the Commission to include \u0026ldquo;the temporary placement only\u0026rdquo; of Japanese Canadians \u0026ldquo;during the continuation of the state of war now existing.\u0026rdquo; Additionally, section 12 was amended to add the following: 12.(2) The Custodian may, notwithstanding anything contained in this Regulation, order that all or any property whatsoever, situated in any protected area of British Columbia, belonging to any person of the Japanese race shall, for the purpose of protecting the interests of the owner or any other person, be vested in the Custodian, and the Custodian shall have full power to administer such property for the benefit of all such interested persons, and shall release such property upon being satisfied that the interests aforesaid will not be prejudiced thereby.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nAs would become evident in the Nakashima case, the Orders that constituted the dispossession created a cross-weave of conflicting powers and responsibilities. Aspects of the orders suggest essentially unlimited governmental power over all Japanese-Canadian-owned property, including the power to dispose of the property for any reason. Reference to the Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy also indicated a pervasive tendency to conflate Japanese Canadians with the country of Japan and to cast loyal Canadians of Japanese descent as enemies. But the wide powers of disposal and racist framing must be considered alongside provisions that created a legal trust. Beginning with the notion that property was being held in \u0026ldquo;custody,\u0026rdquo; without charging administrative fees, the orders overlaid the vesting of Japanese-Canadian-owned property in the Custodian with a legally significant purpose: \u0026ldquo;[A]s a protective measure only.\u0026rdquo; Order 2483 further stipulated that property was to be held for the \u0026ldquo;benefit\u0026rdquo; of \u0026ldquo;interested persons\u0026rdquo; (earlier defined as \u0026ldquo;the owner or any other person\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;presumably family members and creditors without title). Moreover, given that the orders granted only the \u0026ldquo;temporary\u0026rdquo; power to remove and intern Japanese Canadians, the orders assumed that property would be returned to original owners at the conclusion of \u0026ldquo;the state of war now existing.\u0026rdquo; Read together, and in sequence, the orders circumscribed the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s powers over Japanese-Canadian-owned property with deliberate limits. Without saying so expressly, Order 1665 as amended by Order 2483 created a legal trust.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nDuring the summer and fall of 1942, federal officials began to contemplate a breach of the legal trust and a betrayal of the promise to protect. Officials in the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s office faced mounting pressure to sell Japanese-Canadian-owned farms (from staff of the Soldier Settlement Board, which wanted them for veterans) and urban properties (particularly in the City of Vancouver, where officials contemplated a redevelopment of the largest prewar Japanese-Canadian neighbourhood). As the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s office considered these proposals, they began to discuss the sale of all Japanese-Canadian-owned property, including real estate and personal belongings. These communications continued to focus on pragmatic concerns. McPherson in particular came to see sale as the most feasible solution to the problems of property management. At the same time, the sales would allay concerns about costs of the internment, since the funds realized in the sale of the property would be credited to the Japanese-Canadian property-owners and put towards the costs of maintaining internment. By leaving Japanese Canadians with virtually nothing in British Columbia, the forced sales also advanced the aim, shared by almost all officials (even advocates of robust trusteeship), to permanently disperse Japanese Canadians from the province. In a letter to the Minister of Justice, Louis St. Laurent, Secretary of State McLarty (a former lawyer as well), conveyed the policy consensus that, \u0026ldquo;[t]he situation in British Columbia concerning both urban and farm properties of Japanese who have been evacuated is exceeding difficult.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;[I]t was the unanimous view of the members of Council who looked into the problem,\u0026rdquo; he wrote, \u0026ldquo;that it would probably be necessary to take steps to liquidate, with appropriate safeguards for the protection of the interests of the owners of the Japanese race.\u0026rdquo; In effect, the government decided that all Japanese-Canadian-owned property remaining in the \u0026ldquo;protected area\u0026rdquo; would be sold. On 19 January 1943, the Government announced in Order 469 that \u0026ldquo;the evacuation of persons of the Japanese race from the protected areas has now been substantially completed and that it is necessary to provide facilities for liquidation of property in appropriate cases.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Wherever,\u0026rdquo; Order 469 stated, under Orders in Council \u0026hellip; the Custodian has been vested with the power and responsibility of controlling and managing any property of persons of the Japanese race evacuated from the protected areas, such power and responsibility shall be deemed to include and to have included from the date of the vesting of such property in the Custodian, the power to liquidate, sell, or otherwise dispose of such property.\nSales of the real property of Japanese Canadians began in the spring of 1943. Within the year, the Custodian had sold the majority of Japanese-Canadian-owned property, although periodic sales continued for more than six years thereafter.\nDespite the fact that Order 469 reiterated that the Custodian\u0026rsquo;s power of \u0026ldquo;management and control\u0026rdquo; included the authority to sell, that power had always been present as long as the Custodian acted according to the terms of the trust: Namely, selling property only if such sales were for the protective benefit of Japanese-Canadian owners, and if the property could not be returned at the conclusion of the war. The power to sell was always qualified by a legal promise to protect the owners\u0026rsquo; interest in their property. The government\u0026rsquo;s promise to protect was all the more important since the government had created the conditions that made the protection necessary in the first place; it was the uprooting that emptied houses, abandoned vehicles in driveways, and left household possessions the target of looters and thieves. It was the demands of Japanese Canadians, and the threats of their resistance, in addition to internal concerns about property rights and natural justice, that led to the promise to protect.\n"},{"id":184,"href":"/casebook/other/law-and-economy/","title":"Three Assumptions About Law and the Economy","section":"Chapter 6","content":" Three assumptions about law and the economy # The three key assumptions sketched below are pervasive in court cases, in public policy forums, and in the media when people are debating and discussing the relationship between law and the economy. They run so deep that we often fail to notice them. The problem with these three assumptions\u0026ndash;and a failure to treat them as such\u0026ndash;is that they tend to view \u0026ldquo;law\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;economy\u0026rdquo; as separate and distinct phenomena, instead of two aspects of social life that constitute one another. These assumptions draw our attention away from the central idea that economies and economic exchange cannot exist without some underlying legal rules or norms. What forms of economic exchange exist\u0026ndash;and who benefits from those exchanges\u0026ndash;are therefore determined in large part by those who shape the law and the choices they make.\nAssumption #1: Free Markets are Natural \u0026ndash; we often take as given that \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; market exchange is a natural condition of human societies, while accepting that regulation by government through law is an unnatural or artificial constraint on economic activity. This assumption is based on a taken-for-granted separation of the market from the legal system, where the former is assumed to be independent of and prior to the latter. To understand this assumption, we can draw a useful analogy to a natural watercourse (we will return to vividly to this analogy in Week 8. Rivers and streams might be \u0026ldquo;artificially\u0026rdquo; damned or the water diverted by human engineering. But while the river in this analogy might have very well have preceded any human intervention and therefore be characterized as \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo;, But are we right to describe a particular system of economic exchange in the same way?\nAssumption #2: The Consequences of Market Competition are Neutral \u0026ndash; if free market exchange is assumed to be a natural condition of human societies, it follows that the resulting distribution of benefits and burdens\u0026ndash;of advantage and disadvantage\u0026ndash;is itself a natural consequence of market competition. In other words, market outcomes are neutral to the extent that they remain free from \u0026ldquo;political\u0026rdquo; interference. This assumption of neutrality conceals the reality that creating or modifying legal rules involves the exercise of judgement, discretion and power, and that such decisions inevitably privilege certain interests and values over others.\nAssumption #3: Our Current System of Economic Exchange is Necessary \u0026ndash; of course, some form of economic exchange is necessary for human societies to function and flourish. But accepting this assertion is distinct from the idea that our actual, real-world economy in its current form is necessary, i.e. inevitable. As we will see throughout the course, the legal history of property is full of contingencies and real choices taken by real people\u0026ndash;choices that were not at all inevitable. This means that difference choices, and therefore different distributions of benefits and burdens, were possible. Acknowledging this idea says nothing about whether the choices taken were right or wrong\u0026ndash;only that they were in fact choices and not the predetermined result of a natural or neutral institution.\n"},{"id":185,"href":"/casebook/governance/trespass/","title":"Trespass to Land","section":"Chapter 2","content":"The name of the most familiar tort protecting real property, trespass, was originally the name of an entire family of actions that first emerged in the 12th and 13th centuries. A plaintiff would commence his case by going to the royal Chancery and purchasing a writ commanding the defendant to come before the courts and explain why he had done such-and-such a thing against the plaintiff’s rights. The Latin phrases used by the Chancery clerks who filled out the writs – and which the royal courts insisted on when hearing a case – came to define individual forms of action.\nOne of the earliest such formulaic phrases, and one with one of the longest careers in the common law, was trespass quare clausum fregit (literally, “why he broke the close,” and often abbreviated to “trespass q.c.f.”). The gist of the action was that the defendant, wrongfully, with force and arms (in Latin, vi et armis) and against the King’s peace, had broken into the plaintiff’s enclosed lands and caused injury. As in a trespass action for intentional battery, a plaintiff bringing an action for trespass q.c.f. could obtain money damages to the extent of his injuries. Trespass q.c.f. was the natural cause of action for damaging the plaintiff’s crops or destroying his buildings.\nTrespass is also a crime (or a quasi-criminal action), but it is a surprisingly mild one, as you can see in Harrison v Carswell and in Nova Scotia\u0026rsquo;s Protection of Property Act.\n"},{"id":186,"href":"/casebook/title/tsilhqotin/","title":"Tsilhqot’in Nation v.

What are the constitutional constraints on provincial regulation of land under Aboriginal title? Finally, how are broader public interests to be reconciled with the rights conferred by Aboriginal title? These are among the important questions raised by this appeal.\nThese reasons conclude:\nAboriginal title flows from occupation in the sense of regular and exclusive use of land.\nIn this case, Aboriginal title is established over the area designated by the trial judge.\nAboriginal title confers the right to use and control the land and to reap the benefits flowing from it.\nWhere title is asserted, but has not yet been established, s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 requires the Crown to consult with the group asserting title and, if appropriate, accommodate its interests.\nOnce Aboriginal title is established, s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 permits incursions on it only with the consent of the Aboriginal group or if they are justified by a compelling and substantial public purpose and are not inconsistent with the Crown’s fiduciary duty to the Aboriginal group; for purposes of determining the validity of provincial legislative incursions on lands held under Aboriginal title, this framework displaces the doctrine of interjurisdictional immunity.\nIn this case, the Province’s land use planning and forestry authorizations were inconsistent with its duties owed to the Tsilhqot’in people.\nII. The Historic Backdrop # For centuries, people of the Tsilhqot’in Nation — a grouping of six bands sharing common culture and history — have lived in a remote valley bounded by rivers and mountains in central British Columbia. They lived in villages, managed lands for the foraging of roots and herbs, hunted and trapped. They repelled invaders and set terms for the European traders who came onto their land. From the Tsilhqot’in perspective, the land has always been theirs.\nThroughout most of Canada, the Crown entered into treaties whereby the indigenous peoples gave up their claim to land in exchange for reservations and other promises, but, with minor exceptions, this did not happen in British Columbia. The Tsilhqot’in Nation is one of hundreds of indigenous groups in British Columbia with unresolved land claims.\nThe issue of Tsilhqot’in title lay latent until 1983, when the Province granted Carrier Lumber Ltd. a forest licence to cut trees in part of the territory at issue. The Xeni Gwet’in First Nations government (one of the six bands that make up the Tsilhqot’in Nation) objected and sought a declaration prohibiting commercial logging on the land. The dispute led to the blockade of a bridge the forest company was upgrading. The blockade ceased when the Premier promised that there would be no further logging without the consent of the Xeni Gwet’in. Talks between the Ministry of Forests and the Xeni Gwet’in ensued, but reached an impasse over the Xeni Gwet’in claim to a right of first refusal to logging. In 1998, the original claim was amended to include a claim for Aboriginal title on behalf of all Tsilhqot’in people.\nThe claim is confined to approximately five percent of what the Tsilhqot’in — a total of about 3,000 people — regard as their traditional territory. The area in question is sparsely populated. About 200 Tsilhqot’in people live there, along with a handful of non-indigenous people who support the Tsilhqot’in claim to title. There are no adverse claims from other indigenous groups. The federal and provincial governments both oppose the title claim.\nIn 2002, the trial commenced before Vickers J. of the British Columbia Supreme Court, and continued for 339 days over a span of five years. The trial judge spent time in the claim area and heard extensive evidence from elders, historians and other experts. He found that the Tsilhqot’in people were in principle entitled to a declaration of Aboriginal title to a portion of the claim area as well as to a small area outside the claim area. However, for procedural reasons which are no longer relied on by the Province, he refused to make a declaration of title (2007 BCSC 1700, [2008] 1 C.N.L.R. 112 (B.C. S.C.)).\nIn 2012, the British Columbia Court of Appeal held that the Tsilhqot’in claim to title had not been established, but left open the possibility that in the future, the Tsilhqot’in might be able to prove title to specific sites within the area claimed. For the rest of the claimed territory, the Tsilhqot’in were confined to Aboriginal rights to hunt, trap and harvest (2012 BCCA 285, 33 B.C.L.R. (5th) 260 (B.C. C.A.)).\nThe Tsilhqot’in now ask this Court for a declaration of Aboriginal title over the area designated by the trial judge, with one exception. A small portion of the area designated by the trial judge consists of either privately owned or underwater lands and no declaration of Aboriginal title over these lands is sought before this Court. With respect to those areas designated by the trial judge that are not privately owned or submerged lands, the Tsilhqot’in ask this Court to restore the trial judge’s finding, affirm their title to the area he designated, and confirm that issuance of forestry licences on the land unjustifiably infringed their rights under that title.\nIII. The Jurisprudential Backdrop # In 1973, the Supreme Court of Canada ushered in the modern era of Aboriginal land law by ruling that Aboriginal land rights survived European settlement and remain valid to the present unless extinguished by treaty or otherwise: Calder v. British Columbia (Attorney General), [1973] S.C.R. 313 (S.C.C.). Although the majority in Calder divided on whether title had been extinguished, its affirmation of Aboriginal rights to land led the Government of Canada to begin treaty negotiations with First Nations without treaties — mainly in British Columbia — resuming a policy that had been abandoned in the 1920s: P. W. Hogg, “The Constitutional Basis of Aboriginal Rights”, M. Morellato, ed., in Aboriginal Law Since Delgamuukw (2009), 3.\nAlmost a decade after Calder, the enactment of s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 “recognized and affirmed” existing Aboriginal rights, although it took some time for the meaning of this section to be fully fleshed out.\nIn Guerin v. R., [1984] 2 S.C.R. 335 (S.C.C.), this Court confirmed the potential for Aboriginal title in ancestral lands. The actual dispute concerned government conduct with respect to reserve lands. The Court held that the government had breached a fiduciary duty to the Musqueam Indian Band. In a concurring opinion, Justice Dickson (later Chief Justice) addressed the theory underlying Aboriginal title. He held that the Crown acquired radical or underlying title to all the land in British Columbia at the time of sovereignty. However, this title was burdened by the “pre-existing legal right” of Aboriginal people based on their use and occupation of the land prior to European arrival (pp. 379-82). Dickson J. characterized this Aboriginal interest in the land as “an independent legal interest” (at p. 385), which gives rise to a sui generis fiduciary duty on the part of the Crown.\nIn 1990, this Court held that s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 constitutionally protected all Aboriginal rights that had not been extinguished prior to April 17, 1982, and imposed a fiduciary duty on the Crown with respect to those rights: R. v. Sparrow, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1075 (S.C.C.). The Court held that under s. 35, legislation can infringe rights protected by s. 35 only if it passes a two-step justification analysis: the legislation must further a “compelling and substantial” purpose and account for the “priority” of the infringed Aboriginal interest under the fiduciary obligation imposed on the Crown (at pp. 1113-19).\nThe principles developed in Calder, Guerin and Sparrow were consolidated and applied in the context of a claim for Aboriginal title in Delgamuukw v. British Columbia, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 1010 (S.C.C.). This Court confirmed the sui generis nature of the rights and obligations to which the Crown’s relationship with Aboriginal peoples gives rise, and stated that what makes Aboriginal title unique is that it arises from possession before the assertion of British sovereignty, as distinguished from other estates such as fee simple that arise afterward. The dual perspectives of the common law and of the Aboriginal group bear equal weight in evaluating a claim for Aboriginal title.\nThe Court in Delgamuukw summarized the content of Aboriginal title by two propositions, one positive and one negative. Positively, “[A]boriginal title encompasses the right to exclusive use and occupation of the land held pursuant to that title for a variety of purposes, which need not be aspects of those [A]boriginal practices, customs and traditions which are integral to distinctive [A]boriginal cultures” (para. 117). Negatively, the “protected uses must not be irreconcilable with the nature of the group’s attachment to that land” (ibid.) — that is, it is group title and cannot be alienated in a way that deprives future generations of the control and benefit of the land.\nThe Court in Delgamuukw confirmed that infringements of Aboriginal title can be justified under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 pursuant to the Sparrow test and described this as a “necessary part of the reconciliation of [A]boriginal societies with the broader political community of which they are part” (at para. 161), quoting R. v. Gladstone, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 723 (S.C.C.), at para. 73. While Sparrow had spoken of priority of Aboriginal rights infringed by regulations over non-aboriginal interests, Delgamuukw articulated the “different” (at para. 168) approach of involvement of Aboriginal peoples — varying depending on the severity of the infringement — in decisions taken with respect to their lands.\nIn Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests), 2004 SCC 73, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 511 (S.C.C.), the Court applied the Delgamuukw idea of involvement of the affected Aboriginal group in decisions about its land to the situation where development is proposed on land over which Aboriginal title is asserted but has not yet been established. The Court affirmed a spectrum of consultation. The Crown’s duty to consult and accommodate the asserted Aboriginal interest “is proportionate to a preliminary assessment of the strength of the case supporting the existence of the right or title, and to the seriousness of the potentially adverse effect upon the right or title claimed” (para. 24). Thus, the idea of proportionate balancing implicit in Delgamuukw reappears in Haida. The Court in Haida stated that the Crown had not only a moral duty, but a legal duty to negotiate in good faith to resolve land claims (para. 25). The governing ethos is not one of competing interests but of reconciliation.\nThe jurisprudence just reviewed establishes a number of propositions that touch on the issues that arise in this case, including:\nRadical or underlying Crown title is subject to Aboriginal land interests where they are established.\nAboriginal title gives the Aboriginal group the right to use and control the land and enjoy its benefits.\nGovernments can infringe Aboriginal rights conferred by Aboriginal title but only where they can justify the infringements on the basis of a compelling and substantial purpose and establish that they are consistent with the Crown’s fiduciary duty to the group.\nResource development on claimed land to which title has not been established requires the government to consult with the claimant Aboriginal group.\nGovernments are under a legal duty to negotiate in good faith to resolve claims to ancestral lands.\nAgainst this background, I turn to the issues raised in this appeal.\nIV. Pleadings in Aboriginal Land Claims Cases # The Province, to its credit, no longer contends that the claim should be barred because of defects in the pleadings. However, it may be useful to address how to approach pleadings in land claims, in view of their importance to future land claims.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal that a functional approach should be taken to pleadings in Aboriginal cases. The function of pleadings is to provide the parties and the court with an outline of the material allegations and relief sought. Where pleadings achieve this aim, minor defects should be overlooked, in the absence of clear prejudice. A number of considerations support this approach.\nFirst, in a case such as this, the legal principles may be unclear at the outset, making it difficult to frame the claim with exactitude.\nSecond, in these cases, the evidence as to how the land was used may be uncertain at the outset. As the claim proceeds, elders will come forward and experts will be engaged. Through the course of the trial, the historic practices of the Aboriginal group in question will be expounded, tested and clarified. The Court of Appeal correctly recognized that determining whether Aboriginal title is made out over a pleaded area is not an “all or nothing” proposition (at para. 117):\nThe occupation of traditional territories by First Nations prior to the assertion of Crown sovereignty was not an occupation based on a Torrens system, or, indeed, on any precise boundaries. Except where impassable (or virtually impassable) natural boundaries existed, the limits of a traditional territory were typically ill-defined and fluid. \u0026hellip; [Therefore] requir[ing] proof of Aboriginal title precisely mirroring the claim would be too exacting. [para. 118]\nThird, cases such as this require an approach that results in decisions based on the best evidence that emerges, not what a lawyer may have envisaged when drafting the initial claim. What is at stake is nothing less than justice for the Aboriginal group and its descendants, and the reconciliation between the group and broader society. A technical approach to pleadings would serve neither goal. It is in the broader public interest that land claims and rights issues be resolved in a way that reflects the substance of the matter. Only thus can the project of reconciliation this Court spoke of in Delgamuukw be achieved.\nV. Is Aboriginal Title Established? # A. The Test for Aboriginal Title # How should the courts determine whether a semi-nomadic indigenous group has title to lands? This Court has never directly answered this question. The courts below disagreed on the correct approach. We must now clarify the test.\nAs we have seen, the Delgamuukw test for Aboriginal title to land is based on “occupation” prior to assertion of European sovereignty. To ground Aboriginal title this occupation must possess three characteristics. It must be sufficient; it must be continuous (where present occupation is relied on); and it must be exclusive.\nThe test was set out in Delgamuukw, per Lamer C.J., at para. 143:\nIn order to make out a claim for [A]boriginal title, the [A]boriginal group asserting title must satisfy the following criteria: (i) the land must have been occupied prior to sovereignty, (ii) if present occupation is relied on as proof of occupation pre-sovereignty, there must be a continuity between present and pre-sovereignty occupation, and (iii) at sovereignty, that occupation must have been exclusive.\nThe trial judge in this case held that “occupation” was established for the purpose of proving title by showing regular and exclusive use of sites or territory. On this basis, he concluded that the Tsilhqot’in had established title not only to village sites and areas maintained for the harvesting of roots and berries, but to larger territories which their ancestors used regularly and exclusively for hunting, fishing and other activities.\nThe Court of Appeal disagreed and applied a narrower test for Aboriginal title — site-specific occupation. It held that to prove sufficient occupation for title to land, an Aboriginal group must prove that its ancestors intensively used a definite tract of land with reasonably defined boundaries at the time of European sovereignty.\nFor semi-nomadic Aboriginal groups like the Tsilhqot’in, the Court of Appeal’s approach results in small islands of title surrounded by larger territories where the group possesses only Aboriginal rights to engage in activities like hunting and trapping. By contrast, on the trial judge’s approach, the group would enjoy title to all the territory that their ancestors regularly and exclusively used at the time of assertion of European sovereignty.\nAgainst this backdrop, I return to the requirements for Aboriginal title: sufficient pre-sovereignty occupation; continuous occupation (where present occupation is relied on); and exclusive historic occupation.\nShould the three elements of the Delgamuukw test be considered independently, or as related aspects of a single concept? The High Court of Australia has expressed the view that there is little merit in considering aspects of occupancy separately. In Western Australia v. Ward (2002), 213 C.L.R. 1 (Australia H.C.), the court stated as follows, at para 89:\nThe expression “possession, occupation, use and enjoyment \u0026hellip; to the exclusion of all others” is a composite expression directed to describing a particular measure of control over access to land. To break the expression into its constituent elements is apt to mislead. In particular, to speak of “possession” of the land, as distinct from possession to the exclusion of all others, invites attention to the common law content of the concept of possession and whatever notions of control over access might be thought to be attached to it, rather than to the relevant task, which is to identify how rights and interests possessed under traditional law and custom can properly find expression in common law terms.\nIn my view, the concepts of sufficiency, continuity and exclusivity provide useful lenses through which to view the question of Aboriginal title. This said, the court must be careful not to lose or distort the Aboriginal perspective by forcing ancestral practices into the square boxes of common law concepts, thus frustrating the goal of faithfully translating pre-sovereignty Aboriginal interests into equivalent modern legal rights. Sufficiency, continuity and exclusivity are not ends in themselves, but inquiries that shed light on whether Aboriginal title is established.\n1. Sufficiency of Occupation # The first requirement — and the one that lies at the heart of this appeal — is that the occupation be sufficient to ground Aboriginal title. It is clear from Delgamuukw that not every passing traverse or use grounds title. What then constitutes sufficient occupation to ground title?\nThe question of sufficient occupation must be approached from both the common law perspective and the Aboriginal perspective (Delgamuukw, at para. 147); see also R. v. Vanderpeet, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 507 (S.C.C.).\nThe Aboriginal perspective focuses on laws, practices, customs and traditions of the group (Delgamuukw, at para. 148). In considering this perspective for the purpose of Aboriginal title, “one must take into account the group’s size, manner of life, material resources, and technological abilities, and the character of the lands claimed”: B. Slattery, “Understanding Aboriginal Rights” (1987), 66 Can. Bar Rev. 727, at p. 758, quoted with approval in Delgamuukw, at para. 149.\nThe common law perspective imports the idea of possession and control of the lands. At common law, possession extends beyond sites that are physically occupied, like a house, to surrounding lands that are used and over which effective control is exercised.\nSufficiency of occupation is a context-specific inquiry. “[O]ccupation may be established in a variety of ways, ranging from the construction of dwellings through cultivation and enclosure of fields to regular use of definite tracts of land for hunting, fishing or otherwise exploiting its resources” (Delgamuukw, at para. 149). The intensity and frequency of the use may vary with the characteristics of the Aboriginal group asserting title and the character of the land over which title is asserted. Here, for example, the land, while extensive, was harsh and was capable of supporting only 100 to 1,000 people. The fact that the Aboriginal group was only about 400 people must be considered in the context of the carrying capacity of the land in determining whether regular use of definite tracts of land is made out.\nTo sufficiently occupy the land for purposes of title, the Aboriginal group in question must show that it has historically acted in a way that would communicate to third parties that it held the land for its own purposes. This standard does not demand notorious or visible use akin to proving a claim for adverse possession, but neither can the occupation be purely subjective or internal. There must be evidence of a strong presence on or over the land claimed, manifesting itself in acts of occupation that could reasonably be interpreted as demonstrating that the land in question belonged to, was controlled by, or was under the exclusive stewardship of the claimant group. As just discussed, the kinds of acts necessary to indicate a permanent presence and intention to hold and use the land for the group’s purposes are dependent on the manner of life of the people and the nature of the land. Cultivated fields, constructed dwelling houses, invested labour, and a consistent presence on parts of the land may be sufficient, but are not essential to establish occupation. The notion of occupation must also reflect the way of life of the Aboriginal people, including those who were nomadic or semi-nomadic.\nIn R. v. Marshall, 2003 NSCA 105, 218 N.S.R. (2d) 78 (N.S. C.A.), at paras. 135-38, Cromwell J.A (as he then was), in reasoning I adopt, likens the sufficiency of occupation required to establish Aboriginal title to the requirements for general occupancy at common law. A general occupant at common law is a person asserting possession of land over which no one else has a present interest or with respect to which title is uncertain. Cromwell J.A. cites (at para. 136) the following extract from K. McNeil, Common Law Aboriginal Title (1989), at pp. 198-200:\nWhat, then, did one have to do to acquire a title by occupancy? \u0026hellip; [I]t appears \u0026hellip; that \u0026hellip; a casual entry, such as riding over land to hunt or hawk, or travelling across it, did not make an occupant, such acts “being only transitory and to a particular purpose, which leaves no marks of an appropriation, or of an intention to possess for the separate use of the rider”. There must, therefore, have been an actual entry, and some act or acts from which an intention to occupy the land could be inferred. Significantly, the acts and intention had to relate only to the occupation — it was quite unnecessary for a potential occupant to claim, or even wish to acquire, the vacant estate, for the law cast it upon him by virtue of his occupation alone\u0026hellip;.\nFurther guidance on what constitutes occupation can be gained from cases involving land to which title is uncertain. Generally, any acts on or in relation to land that indicate an intention to hold or use it for one’s own purposes are evidence of occupation. Apart from the obvious, such as enclosing, cultivating, mining, building upon, maintaining, and warning trespassers off land, any number of other acts, including cutting trees or grass, fishing in tracts of water, and even perambulation, may be relied upon. The weight given to such acts depends partly on the nature of the land, and the purposes for which it can reasonably be used. [Emphasis added.]\nCromwell J.A. in Marshall went on to state that this standard is different from the doctrine of constructive possession. The goal is not to attribute possession in the absence of physical acts of occupation, but to define the quality of the physical acts of occupation that demonstrate possession at law (para. 137). He concluded:\nI would adopt, in general terms, Professor McNeil’s analysis that the appropriate standard of occupation, from the common law perspective, is the middle ground between the minimal occupation which would permit a person to sue a wrong-doer in trespass and the most onerous standard required to ground title by adverse possession as against a true owner\u0026hellip;. Where, as here, we are dealing with a large expanse of territory which was not cultivated, acts such as continual, though changing, settlement and wide-ranging use for fishing, hunting and gathering should be given more weight than they would be if dealing with enclosed, cultivated land. Perhaps most significantly \u0026hellip; it is impossible to confine the evidence to the very precise spot on which the cutting was done: Pollock and Wright at p. 32. Instead, the question must be whether the acts of occupation in particular areas show that the whole area was occupied by the claimant. [para. 138]\nIn summary, what is required is a culturally sensitive approach to sufficiency of occupation based on the dual perspectives of the Aboriginal group in question — its laws, practices, size, technological ability and the character of the land claimed — and the common law notion of possession as a basis for title. It is not possible to list every indicia of occupation that might apply in a particular case. The common law test for possession — which requires an intention to occupy or hold land for the purposes of the occupant — must be considered alongside the perspective of the Aboriginal group which, depending on its size and manner of living, might conceive of possession of land in a somewhat different manner than did the common law.\nThere is no suggestion in the jurisprudence or scholarship that Aboriginal title is confined to specific village sites or farms, as the Court of Appeal held. Rather, a culturally sensitive approach suggests that regular use of territories for hunting, fishing, trapping and foraging is “sufficient” use to ground Aboriginal title, provided that such use, on the facts of a particular case, evinces an intention on the part of the Aboriginal group to hold or possess the land in a manner comparable to what would be required to establish title at common law.\nThe Province argues that this Court in R. v. Marshall, 2005 SCC 43, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 220 (S.C.C.) [hereinafter referred to as Marshall; Bernard], rejected a territorial approach to title, relying on a comment by Professor K. McNeil that the Court there “appears to have rejected the territorial approach of the Court of Appeal” (”Aboriginal Title and the Supreme Court: What’s Happening?” (2006), 69 Sask. L. Rev. 281, cited in British Columbia factum, para. 100). In fact, this Court in Marshall; Bernard did not reject a territorial approach, but held only (at para. 72) that there must be “proof of sufficiently regular and exclusive use” of the land in question, a requirement established in Delgamuukw.\nThe Court in Marshall; Bernard confirmed that nomadic and semi-nomadic groups could establish title to land, provided they establish sufficient physical possession, which is a question of fact. While “[n]ot every nomadic passage or use will ground title to land”, the Court confirmed that Delgamuukw contemplates that “regular use of definite tracts of land for hunting, fishing or otherwise exploiting its resources” could suffice (para. 66). While the issue was framed in terms of whether the common law test for possession was met, the Court did not resile from the need to consider the perspective of the Aboriginal group in question; sufficient occupation is a “question of fact, depending on all the circumstances, in particular the nature of the land and the manner in which it is commonly used” (ibid.).\n2. Continuity of Occupation # Where present occupation is relied on as proof of occupation pre-sovereignty, a second requirement arises — continuity between present and pre-sovereignty occupation.\nThe concept of continuity does not require Aboriginal groups to provide evidence of an unbroken chain of continuity between their current practices, customs and traditions, and those which existed prior to contact (Van der Peet, at para. 65). The same applies to Aboriginal title. Continuity simply means that for evidence of present occupation to establish an inference of pre-sovereignty occupation, the present occupation must be rooted in pre-sovereignty times. This is a question for the trier of fact in each case.\n3. Exclusivity of Occupation # The third requirement is exclusive occupation of the land at the time of sovereignty. The Aboriginal group must have had “the intention and capacity to retain exclusive control” over the lands (Delgamuukw, at para. 156, quoting McNeil, Common Law Aboriginal Title, at p. 204 (emphasis added)). Regular use without exclusivity may give rise to usufructory Aboriginal rights; for Aboriginal title, the use must have been exclusive.\nExclusivity should be understood in the sense of intention and capacity to control the land. The fact that other groups or individuals were on the land does not necessarily negate exclusivity of occupation. Whether a claimant group had the intention and capacity to control the land at the time of sovereignty is a question of fact for the trial judge and depends on various factors such as the characteristics of the claimant group, the nature of other groups in the area, and the characteristics of the land in question. Exclusivity can be established by proof that others were excluded from the land, or by proof that others were only allowed access to the land with the permission of the claimant group. The fact that permission was requested and granted or refused, or that treaties were made with other groups, may show intention and capacity to control the land. Even the lack of challenges to occupancy may support an inference of an established group’s intention and capacity to control.\nAs with sufficiency of occupation, the exclusivity requirement must be approached from both the common law and Aboriginal perspectives, and must take into account the context and characteristics of the Aboriginal society. The Court in Delgamuukw explained as follows, at para. 157:\nA consideration of the [A]boriginal perspective may also lead to the conclusion that trespass by other [A]boriginal groups does not undermine, and that presence of those groups by permission may reinforce, the exclusive occupation of the [A]boriginal group asserting title. For example, the [A]boriginal group asserting the claim to [A]boriginal title may have trespass laws which are proof of exclusive occupation, such that the presence of trespassers does not count as evidence against exclusivity. As well, [A]boriginal laws under which permission may be granted to other [A]boriginal groups to use or reside even temporarily on land would reinforce the finding of exclusive occupation. Indeed, if that permission were the subject of treaties between the [A]boriginal nations in question, those treaties would also form part of the [A]boriginal perspective.\n4. Summary # The claimant group bears the onus of establishing Aboriginal title. The task is to identify how pre-sovereignty rights and interests can properly find expression in modern common law terms. In asking whether Aboriginal title is established, the general requirements are: (1) “sufficient occupation” of the land claimed to establish title at the time of assertion of European sovereignty; (2) continuity of occupation where present occupation is relied on; and (3) exclusive historic occupation. In determining what constitutes sufficient occupation, one looks to the Aboriginal culture and practices, and compares them in a culturally sensitive way with what was required at common law to establish title on the basis of occupation. Occupation sufficient to ground Aboriginal title is not confined to specific sites of settlement but extends to tracts of land that were regularly used for hunting, fishing or otherwise exploiting resources and over which the group exercised effective control at the time of assertion of European sovereignty.\nB. Was Aboriginal Title Established in this Case? # The trial judge applied a test of regular and exclusive use of the land. This is consistent with the correct legal test. This leaves the question of whether he applied it appropriately to the evidence in this case.\nWhether the evidence in a particular case supports Aboriginal title is a question of fact for the trial judge: Marshall; Bernard. The question therefore is whether the Province has shown that the trial judge made a palpable and overriding error in his factual conclusions.\nI approach the question through the lenses of sufficiency, continuity and exclusivity discussed above.\nI will not repeat my earlier comments on what is required to establish sufficiency of occupation. Regular use of the territory suffices to establish sufficiency; the concept is not confined to continuously occupied village sites. The question must be approached from the perspective of the Aboriginal group as well as the common law, bearing in mind the customs of the people and the nature of the land.\nThe evidence in this case supports the trial judge’s conclusion of sufficient occupation. While the population was small, the trial judge found evidence that the parts of the land to which he found title were regularly used by the Tsilhqot’in. The Court of Appeal did not take serious issue with these findings.\nRather, the Court of Appeal based its rejection of Aboriginal title on the legal proposition that regular use of territory could not ground Aboriginal title — only the regular presence on or intensive occupation of particular tracts would suffice. That view, as discussed earlier, is not supported by the jurisprudence; on the contrary, Delgamuukw affirms a territorial use-based approach to Aboriginal title.\nThis brings me to continuity. There is some reliance on present occupation for the title claim in this case, raising the question of continuity. The evidence adduced and later relied on in parts 5-7 of the trial judge’s reasons speak of events that took place as late as 1999. The trial judge considered this direct evidence of more recent occupation alongside archeological evidence, historical evidence, and oral evidence from Aboriginal elders, all of which indicated a continuous Tsilhqot’in presence in the claim area. The geographic proximity between sites for which evidence of recent occupation was tendered, and those for which direct evidence of historic occupation existed, further supported an inference of continuous occupation. Paragraph 945 states, under the heading of “Continuity”, that the “Tsilhqot’in people have continuously occupied the Claim Area before and after sovereignty assertion”. I see no reason to disturb this finding.\nFinally, I come to exclusivity. The trial judge found that the Tsilhqot’in, prior to the assertion of sovereignty, repelled other people from their land and demanded permission from outsiders who wished to pass over it. He concluded from this that the Tsilhqot’in treated the land as exclusively theirs. There is no basis upon which to disturb that finding.\nThe Province goes on to argue that the trial judge’s conclusions on how particular parts of the land were used cannot be sustained. The Province says:\nThe boundaries drawn by the trial judge are arbitrary and contradicted by some of the evidence (factum, at paras. 141 and 142).\nThe trial judge relied on a map the validity of which the Province disputes (para. 143).\nThe Tsilhqot’in population, that the trial judge found to be 400 at the time of sovereignty assertion, could not have physically occupied the 1,900 sq. km of land over which title was found (para. 144).\nThe trial judge failed to identify specific areas with adequate precision, instead relying on vague descriptions (para. 145).\nA close examination of the details of the inconsistent and arbitrary manner in which the trial judge defined the areas subject to Aboriginal title demonstrates the unreliability of his approach (para. 147).\nMost of the Province’s criticisms of the trial judge’s findings on the facts are rooted in its erroneous thesis that only specific, intensively occupied areas can support Aboriginal title. The concern with the small size of the Tsilhqot’in population in 1846 makes sense only if one assumes a narrow test of intensive occupation and if one ignores the character of the land in question which was mountainous and could not have sustained a much larger population. The alleged failure to identify particular areas with precision likewise only makes sense if one assumes a narrow test of intensive occupation. The other criticisms amount to pointing out conflicting evidence. It was the trial judge’s task to sort out conflicting evidence and make findings of fact. The presence of conflicting evidence does not demonstrate palpable and overriding error.\nThe Province has not established that the conclusions of the trial judge are unsupported by the evidence or otherwise in error. Nor has it established his conclusions were arbitrary or insufficiently precise. The trial judge was faced with the herculean task of drawing conclusions from a huge body of evidence produced over 339 trial days spanning a five-year period. Much of the evidence was historic evidence and therefore by its nature sometimes imprecise. The trial judge spent long periods in the claim area with witnesses, hearing evidence about how particular parts of the area were used. Absent demonstrated error, his findings should not be disturbed.\nThis said, I have accepted the Province’s invitation to review the maps and the evidence and evaluate the trial judge’s conclusions as to which areas support a declaration of Aboriginal title. For ease of reference, I attach a map showing the various territories and how the trial judge treated them (Appendix; see Appellant’s factum, “Appendix A”). The territorial boundaries drawn by the trial judge and his conclusions as to Aboriginal title appear to be logical and fully supported by the evidence.\nThe trial judge divided the claim area into six regions and then considered a host of individual sites within each region. He examined expert archeological evidence, historical evidence and oral evidence from Aboriginal elders referring to these specific sites. At some of these sites, although the evidence did suggest a Tsilhqot’in presence, he found it insufficient to establish regular and exclusive occupancy. At other sites, he held that the evidence did establish regular and exclusive occupancy. By examining a large number of individual sites, the trial judge was able to infer the boundaries within which the Tsilhqot’in regularly and exclusively occupied the land. The trial judge, in proceeding this way, made no legal error.\nThe Province also criticises the trial judge for offering his opinion on areas outside the claim area. This, the Province says, went beyond the mandate of a trial judge who should pronounce only on pleaded matters.\nIn my view, this criticism is misplaced. It is clear that no declaration of title could be made over areas outside those pleaded. The trial judge offered his comments on areas outside the claim area, not as binding rulings in the case, but to provide assistance in future land claims negotiations. Having canvassed the evidence and arrived at conclusions on it, it made economic and practical sense for the trial judge to give the parties the benefit of his views. Moreover, as I noted earlier in discussing the proper approach to pleadings in cases where Aboriginal title is at issue, these cases raise special considerations. Often, the ambit of a claim cannot be drawn with precision at the commencement of proceedings. The true state of affairs unfolds only gradually as the evidence emerges over what may be a lengthy period of time. If at the end of the process the boundaries of the initial claim and the boundaries suggested by the evidence are different, the trial judge should not be faulted for pointing that out.\nI conclude that the trial judge was correct in his assessment that the Tsilhqot’in occupation was both sufficient and exclusive at the time of sovereignty. There was ample direct evidence of occupation at sovereignty, which was additionally buttressed by evidence of more recent continuous occupation.\nVI. What Rights Does Aboriginal Title Confer? # As we have seen, Delgamuukw establishes that Aboriginal title “encompasses the right to exclusive use and occupation of the land held pursuant to that title for a variety of purposes” (at para. 117), including non-traditional purposes, provided these uses can be reconciled with the communal and ongoing nature of the group’s attachment to the land. Subject to this inherent limit, the title-holding group has the right to choose the uses to which the land is put and to enjoy its economic fruits (para. 166).\nI will first discuss the legal characterization of the Aboriginal title. I will then offer observations on what Aboriginal title provides to its holders and what limits it is subject to.\nA. The Legal Characterization of Aboriginal Title # The starting point in characterizing the legal nature of Aboriginal title is Justice Dickson’s concurring judgment in Guerin, discussed earlier. At the time of assertion of European sovereignty, the Crown acquired radical or underlying title to all the land in the province. This Crown title, however, was burdened by the pre-existing legal rights of Aboriginal people who occupied and used the land prior to European arrival. The doctrine of terra nullius (that no one owned the land prior to European assertion of sovereignty) never applied in Canada, as confirmed by the Royal Proclamation (1763), R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 1. The Aboriginal interest in land that burdens the Crown’s underlying title is an independent legal interest, which gives rise to a fiduciary duty on the part of the Crown.\nThe content of the Crown’s underlying title is what is left when Aboriginal title is subtracted from it: s. 109 of the Constitution Act, 1867; Delgamuukw. As we have seen, Delgamuukw establishes that Aboriginal title gives “the right to exclusive use and occupation of the land \u0026hellip; for a variety of purposes”, not confined to traditional or “distinctive” uses (para. 117). In other words, Aboriginal title is a beneficial interest in the land: Guerin, at p. 382. In simple terms, the title holders have the right to the benefits associated with the land — to use it, enjoy it and profit from its economic development. As such, the Crown does not retain a beneficial interest in Aboriginal title land.\nWhat remains, then, of the Crown’s radical or underlying title to lands held under Aboriginal title? The authorities suggest two related elements — a fiduciary duty owed by the Crown to Aboriginal people when dealing with Aboriginal lands, and the right to encroach on Aboriginal title if the government can justify this in the broader public interest under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. The Court in Delgamuukw referred to this as a process of reconciling Aboriginal interests with the broader public interests under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.\nThe characteristics of Aboriginal title flow from the special relationship between the Crown and the Aboriginal group in question. It is this relationship that makes Aboriginal title sui generis or unique. Aboriginal title is what it is — the unique product of the historic relationship between the Crown and the Aboriginal group in question. Analogies to other forms of property ownership — for example, fee simple — may help us to understand aspects of Aboriginal title. But they cannot dictate precisely what it is or is not. As La Forest J. put it in Delgamuukw, at para. 190, Aboriginal title “is not equated with fee simple ownership; nor can it be described with reference to traditional property law concepts”.\nB. The Incidents of Aboriginal Title # Aboriginal title confers ownership rights similar to those associated with fee simple, including: the right to decide how the land will be used; the right of enjoyment and occupancy of the land; the right to possess the land; the right to the economic benefits of the land; and the right to pro-actively use and manage the land.\nAboriginal title, however, comes with an important restriction — it is collective title held not only for the present generation but for all succeeding generations. This means it cannot be alienated except to the Crown or encumbered in ways that would prevent future generations of the group from using and enjoying it. Nor can the land be developed or misused in a way that would substantially deprive future generations of the benefit of the land. Some changes — even permanent changes — to the land may be possible. Whether a particular use is irreconcilable with the ability of succeeding generations to benefit from the land will be a matter to be determined when the issue arises.\nThe rights and restrictions on Aboriginal title flow from the legal interest Aboriginal title confers, which in turn flows from the fact of Aboriginal occupancy at the time of European sovereignty which attached as a burden on the underlying title asserted by the Crown at sovereignty. Aboriginal title post-sovereignty reflects the fact of Aboriginal occupancy pre-sovereignty, with all the pre-sovereignty incidents of use and enjoyment that were part of the collective title enjoyed by the ancestors of the claimant group — most notably the right to control how the land is used. However, these uses are not confined to the uses and customs of pre-sovereignty times; like other land-owners, Aboriginal title holders of modern times can use their land in modern ways, if that is their choice.\nThe right to control the land conferred by Aboriginal title means that governments and others seeking to use the land must obtain the consent of the Aboriginal title holders. If the Aboriginal group does not consent to the use, the government’s only recourse is to establish that the proposed incursion on the land is justified under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.\nC. Justification of Infringement # To justify overriding the Aboriginal title-holding group’s wishes on the basis of the broader public good, the government must show: (1) that it discharged its procedural duty to consult and accommodate, (2) that its actions were backed by a compelling and substantial objective; and (3) that the governmental action is consistent with the Crown’s fiduciary obligation to the group: Sparrow.\nThe duty to consult is a procedural duty that arises from the honour of the Crown prior to confirmation of title. Where the Crown has real or constructive knowledge of the potential or actual existence of Aboriginal title, and contemplates conduct that might adversely affect it, the Crown is obliged to consult with the group asserting Aboriginal title and, if appropriate, accommodate the Aboriginal right. The duty to consult must be discharged prior to carrying out the action that could adversely affect the right.\nThe degree of consultation and accommodation required lies on a spectrum as discussed in Haida. In general, the level of consultation and accommodation required is proportionate to the strength of the claim and to the seriousness of the adverse impact the contemplated governmental action would have on the claimed right. “A dubious or peripheral claim may attract a mere duty of notice, while a stronger claim may attract more stringent duties” (para. 37). The required level of consultation and accommodation is greatest where title has been established. Where consultation or accommodation is found to be inadequate, the government decision can be suspended or quashed.\nWhere Aboriginal title is unproven, the Crown owes a procedural duty imposed by the honour of the Crown to consult and, if appropriate, accommodate the unproven Aboriginal interest. By contrast, where title has been established, the Crown must not only comply with its procedural duties, but must also ensure that the proposed government action is substantively consistent with the requirements of s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. This requires both a compelling and substantial governmental objective and that the government action is consistent with the fiduciary duty owed by the Crown to the Aboriginal group.\nI agree with the Court of Appeal that the compelling and substantial objective of the government must be considered from the Aboriginal perspective as well as from the perspective of the broader public. As stated in Gladstone, at para. 72:\n[T]he objectives which can be said to be compelling and substantial will be those directed at either the recognition of the prior occupation of North America by [A]boriginal peoples or — and at the level of justification it is this purpose which may well be most relevant — at the reconciliation of [A]boriginal prior occupation with the assertion of the sovereignty of the Crown. [Emphasis added.]\nAs Delgamuukw explains, the process of reconciling Aboriginal interests with the broader interests of society as a whole is the raison d’être of the principle of justification. Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals are “all here to stay” and must of necessity move forward in a process of reconciliation (para. 186). To constitute a compelling and substantial objective, the broader public goal asserted by the government must further the goal of reconciliation, having regard to both the Aboriginal interest and the broader public objective.\nWhat interests are potentially capable of justifying an incursion on Aboriginal title? In Delgamuukw, this Court, per Lamer C.J., offered this:\nIn the wake of Gladstone, the range of legislative objectives that can justify the infringement of [A]boriginal title is fairly broad. Most of these objectives can be traced to the reconciliation of the prior occupation of North America by [A]boriginal peoples with the assertion of Crown sovereignty, which entails the recognition that “distinctive [A]boriginal societies exist within, and are a part of, a broader social, political and economic community” (at para. 73). In my opinion, the development of agriculture, forestry, mining, and hydroelectric power, the general economic development of the interior of British Columbia, protection of the environment or endangered species, the building of infrastructure and the settlement of foreign populations to support those aims, are the kinds of objectives that are consistent with this purpose and, in principle, can justify the infringement of [A]boriginal title. Whether a particular measure or government act can be explained by reference to one of those objectives, however, is ultimately a question of fact that will have to be examined on a case-by-case basis. [Emphasis added; emphasis in original deleted; para 165]\nIf a compelling and substantial public purpose is established, the government must go on to show that the proposed incursion on the Aboriginal right is consistent with the Crown’s fiduciary duty towards Aboriginal people.\nThe Crown’s fiduciary duty in the context of justification merits further discussion. The Crown’s underlying title in the land is held for the benefit of the Aboriginal group and constrained by the Crown’s fiduciary or trust obligation to the group. This impacts the justification process in two ways.\nFirst, the Crown’s fiduciary duty means that the government must act in a way that respects the fact that Aboriginal title is a group interest that inheres in present and future generations. The beneficial interest in the land held by the Aboriginal group vests communally in the title-holding group. This means that incursions on Aboriginal title cannot be justified if they would substantially deprive future generations of the benefit of the land.\nSecond, the Crown’s fiduciary duty infuses an obligation of proportionality into the justification process. Implicit in the Crown’s fiduciary duty to the Aboriginal group is the requirement that the incursion is necessary to achieve the government’s goal (rational connection); that the government go no further than necessary to achieve it (minimal impairment); and that the benefits that may be expected to flow from that goal are not outweighed by adverse effects on the Aboriginal interest (proportionality of impact). The requirement of proportionality is inherent in the Delgamuukw process of reconciliation and was echoed in Haida’s insistence that the Crown’s duty to consult and accommodate at the claims stage “is proportionate to a preliminary assessment of the strength of the case supporting the existence of the right or title, and to the seriousness of the potentially adverse effect upon the right or title claimed” (para. 39).\nIn summary, Aboriginal title confers on the group that holds it the exclusive right to decide how the land is used and the right to benefit from those uses, subject to one carve-out — that the uses must be consistent with the group nature of the interest and the enjoyment of the land by future generations. Government incursions not consented to by the title-holding group must be undertaken in accordance with the Crown’s procedural duty to consult and must also be justified on the basis of a compelling and substantial public interest, and must be consistent with the Crown’s fiduciary duty to the Aboriginal group.\nD. Remedies and Transition # Prior to establishment of title by court declaration or agreement, the Crown is required to consult in good faith with any Aboriginal groups asserting title to the land about proposed uses of the land and, if appropriate, accommodate the interests of such claimant groups. The level of consultation and accommodation required varies with the strength of the Aboriginal group’s claim to the land and the seriousness of the potentially adverse effect upon the interest claimed. If the Crown fails to discharge its duty to consult, various remedies are available including injunctive relief, damages, or an order that consultation or accommodation be carried out: Carrier Sekani Tribal Council v. British Columbia (Utilities Commission), 2010 SCC 43, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 650 (S.C.C.), at para. 37.\nAfter Aboriginal title to land has been established by court declaration or agreement, the Crown must seek the consent of the title-holding Aboriginal group to developments on the land. Absent consent, development of title land cannot proceed unless the Crown has discharged its duty to consult and can justify the intrusion on title under s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. The usual remedies that lie for breach of interests in land are available, adapted as may be necessary to reflect the special nature of Aboriginal title and the fiduciary obligation owed by the Crown to the holders of Aboriginal title.\nThe practical result may be a spectrum of duties applicable over time in a particular case. At the claims stage, prior to establishment of Aboriginal title, the Crown owes a good faith duty to consult with the group concerned and, if appropriate, accommodate its interests. As the claim strength increases, the required level of consultation and accommodation correspondingly increases. Where a claim is particularly strong — for example, shortly before a court declaration of title — appropriate care must be taken to preserve the Aboriginal interest pending final resolution of the claim. Finally, once title is established, the Crown cannot proceed with development of title land not consented to by the title-holding group unless it has discharged its duty to consult and the development is justified pursuant to s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.\nOnce title is established, it may be necessary for the Crown to reassess prior conduct in light of the new reality in order to faithfully discharge its fiduciary duty to the title-holding group going forward. For example, if the Crown begins a project without consent prior to Aboriginal title being established, it may be required to cancel the project upon establishment of the title if continuation of the project would be unjustifiably infringing. Similarly, if legislation was validly enacted before title was established, such legislation may be rendered inapplicable going forward to the extent that it unjustifiably infringes Aboriginal title.\nE. What Duties Were Owed by the Crown at the Time of the Government Action? # Prior to the declaration of Aboriginal title, the Province had a duty to consult and accommodate the claimed Tsilhqot’in interest in the land. As the Tsilhqot’in had a strong prima facie claim to the land at the time of the impugned government action and the intrusion was significant, the duty to consult owed by the Crown fell at the high end of the spectrum described in Haida and required significant consultation and accommodation in order to preserve the Tsilhqot’in interest.\nWith the declaration of title, the Tsilhqot’in have now established Aboriginal title to the portion of the lands designated by the trial judge with the exception as set out in para. 9 of these reasons. This gives them the right to determine, subject to the inherent limits of group title held for future generations, the uses to which the land is put and to enjoy its economic fruits. As we have seen, this is not merely a right of first refusal with respect to Crown land management or usage plans. Rather, it is the right to proactively use and manage the land.\nVII. Breach of the Duty to Consult # The alleged breach in this case arises from the issuance by the Province of licences permitting third parties to conduct forestry activity and construct related infrastructure on the land in 1983 and onwards, before title was declared. During this time, the Tsilhqot’in held an interest in the land that was not yet legally recognized. The honour of the Crown required that the Province consult them on uses of the lands and accommodate their interests. The Province did neither and breached its duty owed to the Tsilhqot’in.\nThe Crown’s duty to consult was breached when Crown officials engaged in the planning process for the removal of timber. The inclusion of timber on Aboriginal title land in a timber supply area, the approval of cut blocks on Aboriginal title land in a forest development plan, and the allocation of cutting permits all occurred without any meaningful consultation with the Tsilhqot’in.\nI add this. Governments and individuals proposing to use or exploit land, whether before or after a declaration of Aboriginal title, can avoid a charge of infringement or failure to adequately consult by obtaining the consent of the interested Aboriginal group.\n[…]\nIX. Conclusion # I would allow the appeal and grant a declaration of Aboriginal title over the area at issue, as requested by the Tsilhqot’in. I further declare that British Columbia breached its duty to consult owed to the Tsilhqot’in through its land use planning and forestry authorizations.\nAppeal allowed.\n"},{"id":187,"href":"/casebook/governance/tulk/","title":"Tulk v Moxhay ","section":"Chapter 2","content":"In the year 1808 the Plaintiff, being then the owner in fee of the vacant piece of ground in Leicester Square, as well as of several of the houses forming the Square, sold the piece of ground by the description of \u0026ldquo;Leicester Square garden or pleasure ground, with the equestrian statue then standing in the centre thereof, and the iron railing and stone work round the same,\u0026rdquo; to one Elms in fee: and the deed of conveyance contained a covenant by Elms, for himself, his heirs, and assigns, with the Plaintiff, his heirs, executors, and administrators, \u0026ldquo;that Elms, his heirs, and assigns should, and would from time to time, and at all times thereafter at his and their own costs and charges, keep and maintain the said piece of ground and square garden, and the iron railing round the same in its then form, and in sufficient and proper repair as a square garden and pleasure ground, in an open state, uncovered with any buildings, in neat and ornamental order; and that it should be lawful for the inhabitants of Leicester Square, tenants of the Plaintiff, on payment of a reasonable rent for the same, to have keys at their own expense and the privilege of admission therewith at any time or times into the said square garden and pleasure ground.\u0026rdquo;\nThe piece of land so conveyed passed by divers mesne conveyances into the hands of the Defendant, whose purchase deed contained no similar covenant with his vendor: but he admitted that he had purchased with notice of the covenant in the deed of 1808.\nThe Defendant having manifested an intention to alter the-character of the square garden, and asserted a right, if he thought fit, to build upon it, the Plaintiff, who still remained owner of several houses in the square, filed this bill for an injunction; and an injunction was granted by the Master of the Rolls to restrain the Defendant from converting or using the piece of ground and square garden, and the iron railing round the same, to or for any other purpose than as a square garden and pleasure ground in an open state, and uncovered with buildings.\nOn a motion, now made, to discharge that order, Mr. R. Palmer, for the Defendant, contended that the covenant did not run with the land, so as to be binding at law upon a purchaser from the covenantor, and he relied on the dictum of Lord Brougham C. in Keppell v. Bayley (2 M. \u0026amp; K. 547), to the effect that notice of such a covenant did not give a Court of Equity jurisdiction to enforce it by injunction against such purchaser, inasmuch as \u0026ldquo;the knowledge by an assignee of an estate, that his assignor had assumed to bind others than the law authorised him to affect by his contract-had attempted to create a burthen upon property which was inconsistent with the nature of that property, and unknown to the principles of the law-could not bind such assignee by affecting his conscience.\u0026rdquo; In applying that doctrine to the present case, he drew a distinction between a formal covenant as this was, and a contract existing in mere agreement, and requiring some further act to carry it into effect; contending that executory contracts of the latter description were alone such as were binding in equity upon purchasers with notice; for that where the contract between the parties was executed in the form of a covenant, their mutual rights and liabilities were determined by the legal operation of that instrument, and that if a Court of Equity were to give a more extended operation to such covenant, it would be giving the party that for which he had never contracted. He admitted, indeed, that the decisions of the Vice-Chancellor of England in Whatman v. Gibson (9 Sim. 196) and Schreiber v. Creed (10 Sim. 35) were not reconcileable with that doctrine; but he referred to the present Lord Chancellor\u0026rsquo;s order, on appeal, in Mann v. Stephens (15 Sim. 379), as apparently sanctioning it by the liberty there given to the Plaintiff to bring an action, from which it was to be inferred that his Lordship thought that the right of the Plaintiff to relief in equity depended upon, and was commensurate with, his right of action upon the covenant at law.\nThe Lord Chancellor (Cottenham) — # That this Court has jurisdiction to enforce a contract between the owner of land and his neighbour purchasing a part of it, that the latter shall either use or abstain from using the land purchased in a particular way, is what I never knew disputed. Here there is no question about the contract: the owner of certain houses in the square sells the land adjoining, with a covenant from the purchaser not to use it for any other purpose than as a square garden. And it is now contended, not that the vendee could violate that contract, but that he might sell the piece of land, and that the purchaser from him may violate it without this Court having any power to interfere. If that were so, it would be impossible for an owner of land to sell part of it without incurring the risk of rendering what he retains worthless. It is said that, the covenant being one which does not run with the land, this Court cannot enforce it; but the question is, not whether the covenant runs with the land, but whether a party shall be permitted to use the land in a manner inconsistent with the contract entered into by his vendor, and with notice of which he purchased. Of course, the price would be affected by the covenant, and nothing could be more inequitable than that the original purchaser should be able to sell the property the next day for a greater price, in consideration of the assignee being allowed to escape from the liability which he had himself undertaken.\nThat the question does not depend upon whether the covenant runs with the land is evident from this, that if there was a mere agreement and no covenant, this Court would enforce it against a party purchasing with notice of it; for if an equity is attached to the property by the owner, no one purchasing with notice of that equity can stand in a different situation from the party from whom he purchased. There are not only cases before the Vice-Chancellor of England, in which he considered that doctrine as not in dispute; but looking at the ground on which Lord Eldon disposed of the case of The Duke of Bedford v. The Trustees of the British Museum(2 My. \u0026amp; K. 552), it is impossible to suppose that he entertained any doubt of it. In the case of Mann v. Stephens before me, I never intended to make the injunction depend upon the result of the action: nor does the order imply it. The motion was, to discharge an order for the commitment of the Defendant for an alleged breach of the injunction, and also to dissolve the injunction. I upheld the injunction, but discharged the order of commitment, on the ground that it was not clearly proved that any breach had been committed; but there being a doubt whether part of the premises on which the Defendant was proceeding to build was locally situated within what was called the Dell, on which alone he had under the covenant a right to build at all, and the Plaintiff insisting that it was not, I thought the pendency of the suit ought not to prejudice the Plaintiff in his right to bring an action if he thought he had such right, and, therefore, I give him liberty to do so.\nWith respect to the observations of Lord Brougham in Keppell v. Bailey, he never could have meant to lay down that this Court would not enforce an equity attached to land by the owner, unless under such circumstances as would maintain an action at law. If that be the result of his observations, I can only say that I cannot coincide with it.\nI think the cases cited before the Vice-Chancellor and this decision of the Master of the Rolls perfectly right, and, therefore, that this motion must be refused, with costs.\nMotion dismissed.\n"},{"id":188,"href":"/casebook/shelter/victoria-city/","title":"Victoria (City) v Adams","section":"Chapter 4","content":" Ross J. — # I Introduction # This litigation arises from what Senior District Judge Atkins in Pottinger v. Miami (City), 810 F. Supp. 1551 (U.S. Dist. Ct. S.D. Fla. 1992) at 1554 described as:\n\u0026hellip; an inevitable conflict between the need of homeless individuals to perform essential, life-sustaining acts in public and the responsibility of the government to maintain orderly, aesthetically pleasing public parks and streets.\nThe particular issue in this litigation concerns the prohibition against erecting temporary shelter on public property that is contained in the Parks Regulation Bylaw and the Streets and Traffic Bylaw (the “Bylaws”) of the City of Victoria (the “City”). Natalie Adams, Yann Chartier, Amber Overall, Alymanda Wawai, Conrad Fletcher, Sebastien Matte, Simon Ralph, Heather Turnquist and David Arthur Johnston (the “Defendants”), who are all homeless people living in the City, contend that this prohibition infringes the rights of homeless people to life, liberty and security of the person in a manner not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice, contrary to s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, [Charter] being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982, (U.K.), 1982, c. 11. The intervener, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association (the “BCCLA”), supports the defendants in this contention.\nThe intervener, the Attorney General for the Province of British Columbia ( the “AGBC”), and the City, contend that the claim does not fall within the scope of s. 7 of the Charter, that the prohibition does not infringe s. 7 and that in any event any infringement is justified pursuant to s. 1 of the Charter. The City contends that the prohibition is necessary to preserve and maintain the City’s parks.\nThe following findings were made on the basis of the evidence submitted at trial:\n(a) There are at present more than 1,000 homeless people living in the City.\n(b) The City has at present 104 shelter beds, expanding to 326 in extreme conditions. Thus hundreds of the homeless have no option but to sleep outside in the public spaces of the City.\n(c) The Bylaws do not prohibit sleeping in public spaces. They do prohibit taking up a temporary abode. In practical terms this means that the City prohibits the homeless from erecting any form of overhead protection including, for example, a tent, a tarp strung up to create a shelter or a cardboard box, even on a temporary basis.\n(d) The expert evidence establishes that exposure to the elements without adequate protection is associated with a number of significant risks to health including the risk of hypothermia, a potentially fatal condition.\n(e) The expert evidence also establishes that some form of overhead protection is part of what is necessary for adequate protection from the elements.\nOn the basis of this evidentiary record and for the reasons that follow, I have found that a significant number of people in the City of Victoria have no choice but to sleep outside in the City’s parks or streets. The City’s Bylaws prohibit those homeless persons from erecting even the most rudimentary form of shelter to protect them from the elements. The prohibition on erecting shelter is in effect at all times, in all public places in the City. I have found further that the effect of the prohibition is to impose upon those homeless persons, who are among the most vulnerable and marginalized of the City’s residents, significant and potentially severe additional health risks. In addition, sleep and shelter are necessary preconditions to any kind of security, liberty or human flourishing. I have concluded that the prohibition on taking a temporary abode contained in the Bylaws and operational policy constitutes an interference with the life, liberty and security of the person of these homeless people. I have concluded that the prohibition is both arbitrary and overbroad and hence not consistent with the principles of fundamental justice. I finally have concluded further that infringement is not justified pursuant to s. 1 of the Charter.\nII History of the Litigation # This action was commenced by the City in October 2005 as an action to obtain a civil injunction to enforce municipal bylaws respecting parks and public space.\nThe City established and maintains a public park named Cridge Park. In October 2005, a tent city was established at Cridge Park (the “Tent City”) by a number of homeless people, including the named Defendants. A group of up to 70 people occupied the park, setting up more than 20 tents. Two large kitchen areas were constructed using tables and electrical cords that ran from the cooking area to an outdoor electrical outlet in the church building located adjacent to the north side of the park.\nRelying on two City bylaws, the Parks Regulation Bylaw and the Streets and Traffic Bylaw, which at that time prohibited, inter alia, loitering or taking up temporary abode overnight in public parks, the City commenced enforcement proceedings under s. 274(1)(a) of the Community Charter, S.B.C. 2003, c. 26. To this end, it filed a writ seeking an injunction, inter alia, declaring the use and occupation of Cridge Park by the occupants of the Tent City to be in contravention of the Bylaws; restraining the Defendants and others from contravening the Bylaws; and authorizing and empowering the police to arrest those found contravening the Bylaws.\nOn October 14, 2005, a notice was distributed to the persons who were occupying the park. The notice stated:\nNOTICE TO ILLEGAL OCCUPIERS OF CRIDGE PARK\nWe are the solicitors for the City of Victoria and advise you of impending injunction proceedings that have been authorized by Council with respect to this matter. This means that we will obtain a Court Order requiring you to remove yourself and your possessions off Cridge Park. In particular, we advise that persons who are presently loitering and/or camping at Cridge Park, and any other park within the City of Victoria, are in contravention of the City’s Parks Regulation Bylaw.\nIn particular, Section 28 of the Parks Regulation Bylaw No. 91-19 states that:\n(1) No person may \u0026hellip; loiter or take up a temporary abode overnight on any portion of any park, or obstruct the free use and enjoyment of any park by any other person, or violate any bylaw, rule, regulation or notice concerning any park.\n(2) Any person conducting himself as aforesaid may be removed from a park and is deemed to be guilty of an infraction of this bylaw.\nAccordingly, you are ordered to vacate Cridge Park immediately, and in any event no later than Monday, October 17, 2005 at 10:00 a.m. Failure to do so may result in the confiscation of your camping equipment and other personal property. It will further result in investigatory and injunction proceedings without further notice to you.\nWe further advise you that damage to trees, gardens and other City property will result in criminal and civil sanctions.\nWe urge you to avoid the loss of your possessions by moving to temporary housing operated by the Victoria [C]ool Aid Society at either one of the following two locations:\n(1) Streetlink Emergency Shelter (co-ed)\n1634 Store Street\nph: 383-1951\n(2) Sandi Merriman House (adult woman)\n809 Burdett Street\nph: 480-1408\nPlease use the above services if you are in any need of food and shelter.\nFinally, be advised that you are not permitted to move yourself or your belongings to any other City park or public access way within the jurisdiction of the City of Victoria. Again, you risk the confiscation of your personal property.\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation.\n[emphasis in original]\nThe persons who were staying in the Tent City did not respond to the notice. The City then brought an application for an interlocutory injunction pursuant to s. 274 of the Community Charter. The City sought injunctive relief in the following terms:\n(1) The defendants and anyone else having notice of this order be restrained from loitering or taking up a temporary abode overnight in any portion of lands legally described as, and commonly known as Cridge Park; \u0026hellip;\n(2) The defendants and anyone else having notice of this order be restrained from posting any advertisements or handbills of any kind in any portion of Cridge Park within the City of Victoria;\n(3) The defendants and anyone else having notice of this order be restrained from erecting any tent or shelter in any portion of Cridge Park within the City of Victoria;\n(4) The defendants and anyone else having notice of this order remove from Cridge Park within the City of Victoria any items, including, but not limited to, signs, chattels, tents, tarps, swings, personal belongings of any type and other thing which in any way encumbers or obstructs the free use and enjoyment of any portion of Cridge Park or has been otherwise placed in contravention of the bylaws, and in the event the defendants or anyone else having notice of this order fail to remove such obstruction or thing, that the plaintiff be at liberty to do so at the cost of the defendants or other person having notice of this order;\n(5) Authorizes and empowers any peace officer to arrest and remove any person the peace officer has reasonable and probable grounds to believe is contravening or has contravened the provisions of any order issued by this honourable court.\n[…]\nIII The Bylaws # The City is authorized to regulate, prohibit and impose requirements in relation to public places pursuant to ss. 8(3) and 62 of the Community Charter, which provide:\nFundamental Powers\n8(3) A council may, by bylaw, regulate, prohibit and impose requirements in relation to the following:\n(a) municipal services;\n(b) public places;\n(c) trees;\n(d) firecrackers, fireworks and explosives;\n(e) bows and arrows, knives and other weapons not referred to in subsection (5);\n(f) cemeteries, crematoriums, columbariums and mausoleums and the interment or other disposition of the dead;\n(g) the health, safety or protection of persons or property in relation to matters referred to in section 63 [protection of persons and property];\n(h) the protection and enhancement of the well-being of its community in relation to the matters referred to in section 64 [nuisances, disturbances and other objectionable situations];\n(i) public health;\n(j) protection of the natural environment;\n(k) animals;\n(l) buildings and other structures;\n(m) the removal of soil and the deposit of soil or other material.\n[…]\nPublic place powers\n62 The authority under section 8(3)(b) [spheres of authority — public places] includes the authority in relation to persons, property, things and activities that are in, on or near public places.\nThe City has enacted Parks Regulation Bylaw No. 07-059. Under the provisions of this current Parks Regulation Bylaw, sleeping in parks or public spaces in no longer prohibited. The Bylaw does prohibit taking up a temporary abode. The Parks Regulation Bylaw provides in part:\nDamage to environment, structures\n13(1) A person must not do any of the following activities in a park:\n(a) cut, break, injure, remove, climb, or in any way destroy or damage\n(i) a tree, shrub, plant, turf, flower, or seed, or\n(ii) a building or structure, including a fence, sign, seat, bench, or ornament of any kind;\n(b) foul or pollute a fountain or natural body of water;\n(c) paint, smear, or otherwise deface or mutilate a rock in a park;\n(d) damage, deface or destroy a notice or sign that is lawfully posted;\n(e) transport household, yard, or commercial waste into a park for the purpose of disposal;\n(f) dispose of household, yard, or commercial waste in a park.\n(2) A person may deposit waste, debris, offensive matter, or other substances, excluding household, yard, and commercial waste, in a park only if deposited into receptacles provided for that purpose.\nNuisances, obstructions\n14(1) A person must not do any of the following activities in a park:\n(a) behave in a disorderly or offensive manner;\n(b) molest or injure another person;\n(c) obstruct the free use and enjoyment of the park by another person;\n(d) take up a temporary abode over night;\n(e) paint advertisements;\n(f) distribute handbills for commercial purposes;\n(g) place posters;\n(h) disturb, injure, or catch a bird, animal, or fish;\n(i) throw or deposit injurious or offensive matter, or any matter that may cause a nuisance, into an enclosure used for keeping animals or birds;\n(j) consume liquor, as defined in the Liquor Control and Licensing Act, except in compliance with a licence issued under the Liquor Control and Licensing Act.\n(2) A person may do any of the following activities in a park only if that person has received prior express permission under section 5:\n(a) encumber or obstruct a footpath;\n[…]\nConstruction\n16 (1) A person may erect or construct, or cause to be erected or constructed, a tent, building or structure, including a temporary structure such as a tent, in a park only as permitted under this Bylaw, or with the express prior permission of the Council, […]\nMike McCliggott, Acting City Manager, deposed that the City’s policy concerning the interpretation and application of the Parks Regulation Bylaw and the Streets and Traffic Bylaw as reflected in the operational policy of the Victoria Police is as follows:\n(a) Parks Regulation Bylaw — when police encounter people sleeping in a park [during daytime hours] and there is no evidence of those persons taking up temporary abode in the park, they are not awoken or asked to move on;\n(b) Streets and Traffic Bylaw — where police encounter homeless people sleeping in public spaces between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., they do not generally awake or request the person(s) to move on if they are not obstructing a sidewalk, street or other right-of-way, or interfering with the use of a public amenity such as a bus shelter;\n(c) In both cases, when concerned about a person’s welfare, police may need to waken the person in order to assess their health condition.\nHe deposed that the City does not prohibit people from creating shelter for themselves so long as a person is not taking up a temporary abode. People are allowed to protect themselves from the elements and to stay warm while they are sleeping through simple, individual, non-structural, weather repellent covers that are removed once the person is awake. He deposed that it is the City’s position that the Parks Regulation Bylaw prohibits the taking up of a temporary abode overnight and accordingly no tents, tarps that are attached to trees or otherwise erected, boxes or other structures are permitted.\nThe parties agreed to proceed on the basis that the current state of the law is reflected in the combination of the Bylaws and the operational policy described by Mr. McCliggott. The focus of the constitutional inquiry is directed to the gap between what is permitted by the Bylaws and operational policy of the City and what is prohibited by those Bylaws and the policy.\nIV Facts # A. The Homeless in Victoria # 1. The Number of Homeless in Victoria # There have been several recent studies that have attempted to identify the number of homeless people in Victoria. All of the studies recognised the difficulties in conducting an accurate survey of this population such that all efforts to count are likely to result in underestimates. The most recent, thorough and comprehensive of these studies is the Mayor’s Task Force Report.\nThe Mayor’s Task Force Report, published on October 19, 2007, concluded that at least 1,200 people are homeless in or near downtown Victoria and another 300 are living in extremely unstable housing situations. The Gap Report of the Analysis Team’s included in the Mayor’s Task Force Report noted that the baseline statistics for determining homeless numbers in Victoria are likely an under-reporting and that current planning efforts to address the needs of the chronically homeless should be calculated based upon 1,500 individuals.\nThe Mayor’s Task Force Report concluded at p. 7 that “without the addition of sufficient supported housing units, the homeless population in Victoria is expected to increase by 20-30 percent per annum”, or an additional 300-450 people per year.\nA survey of the homeless in Victoria was conducted on January 15, 2005, in which 150 community volunteers were assigned to survey specific geographical routes in the Greater Victoria area between the hours of midnight and 6:00 a.m. On that night the temperatures dropped to minus 10°C. The survey identified 700 homeless people. One hundred and sixty-eight people were found sleeping outside. The survey identified 47 children dependent upon someone who was homeless.\n2. Profile of the Homeless Population # The Homeless Needs Survey taken in 2007 and cited in the Mayor’s Task Force Report provided further information with respect to the composition of the homeless population in Greater Victoria.\nThe Gap Analysis Report included the following results of that survey at p. 7:\nTable 1: Homeless and unstably housed people identified through Homeless Needs Survey\nAs noted in this chart, that survey identified 791 persons who were homeless, as opposed to being unstably housed. Of those, 108 were youths between the ages of 16-25 and 59 were children under the age of 16. The surveyors, however, were of the view that this represents a significant underestimate and that the correct figure for homeless young people is likely between 250-300. The survey identified 74 homeless people who had children staying with them. Nineteen percent of those persons surveyed with children were homeless as opposed to being unstably housed.\nThe Mayor’s Task Force Report contained a Report of the Expert Panel. The Report of this group concluded at pp. 7-8:\nWithin the Capital Regional District, I,242+ residents are homeless, which incIudes residents of all ages, including children and seniors, with a peak age for men between 31 and 49\n75 percent of homeless residents are male\nTwo-thirds of homeless residents are absolutely homeless\n30 percent of homeless residents are high risk for health needs; 70 percent are low to moderate risk for health needs\nMental illness and substance use are the norm with at least 40 percent suffering from diagnosable mental illness\nAt least 50 percent of homeless residents are struggling with problematic substance use including alcohol, drugs that are injected (most commonly heroin and cocaine), and drugs that are smoked (including crack cocaine and crystal methamphetamines)\nThere are an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 injection drug users in Victoria, of whom at least 40 percent are homeless or unstably housed\nThe injection drug population is relatively young; 75 percent are male and 20 percent are Aboriginal\nOne survey found that 13 percent are infected with HIV and 74 percent are infected with Hepatitis C virus\nVictoria has a problem with public injection; 30 percent of injection drug users report that the street is the place they most commonly inject drugs\n25 percent of homeless residents have co-occurring disorders (mental illness and substance use problem)\n3. Shelter Beds in Victoria # The Report of the Gap Analysis Team described the number and distribution of shelter beds in Victoria at p. 15:\nThere are 141 permanent shelter beds in Victoria:\n10 beds for youth\n131 beds for adults\n20 beds for women only\n21 beds for men only\n90 beds for both men and women\nAn additional 30 emergency youth mats are provided through the Out of the Rain Shelter during the colder months. When the Extreme Weather Protocol is activated, there are an additional five beds for women and 130 mats available across a number of locations. Of the 135 Extreme Weather spaces, 110 are located in Victoria and 25 are located in Saanich. At the height of extreme weather, 326 residents can be sheltered, leaving the remaining 1,200 plus homeless residents out in the rain.\nIt is clear that even including the Extreme Weather Protocol shelter spaces, the number of homeless people in Victoria substantially exceeds available shelter space. In addition, shelters have restrictions on the number of nights a person can stay and often bar those who are addicted to alcohol or drugs.\nThe City submits that in fact the number of shelter beds is sufficient to meet demand, at least during the time when the Extreme Weather Protocol is in effect. The City relied upon the rough draft of the 2007/08 Victoria Area Extreme Weather Protocol Final Report in support of this contention. [Note: the final draft of this Report was not in evidence.] The Report notes that the Extreme Weather Protocol was in effect on 81 nights during the period between November 21, 2007, and April 20, 2008. […]\nVI Analysis # […]\nA. Section 7 # […]\n3. Does this Claim Follow Within the Scope of Section 7? # […]\n(d) Is this Claim About Property Rights?\nThe AGBC and the City contend that the Defendants claim the right to camp on public property and that this makes the claim in essence about property rights. They submit further that property rights do not fall within the scope of s. 7, citing Alcoholism Foundation of Manitoba v. Winnipeg (City), [1988] 6 W.W.R. 440, 59 Man. R. (2d) 83 (Man. Q.B.), rev’d on other grounds (1990), 69 D.L.R. (4th) 697, 65 Man. R. (2d) 81 (Man. C.A.); Marshall Estate, Re, 2008 NSSC 93, 263 N.S.R. (2d) 347 (N.S. S.C.); and IBM Canada Ltd. v. R., 2001 FCT 1175, 212 F.T.R. 70 (Fed. T.D.), aff’d 2002 FCA 420, 298 N.R. 399 (Fed. C.A.). In their submission, the Defendants’ claim is tantamount to an appropriation of public property for private use.\nIn my view, this objection rests upon a mischaracterization of the matters at issue in this summary trial. The litigation had its origins in the Tent City erected in Cridge Park. It is also the case that many of the Defendants deposed that they wanted to be able to set up and maintain a camp in a park and that for a variety of reasons they preferred the camp in Cridge Park to accommodation in shelters. However, in this summary trial application, the relief sought by the Defendants is not what the AGBC and the City contend is the right to camp on public property. In other words, the issue of the right to camp in public spaces in the sense of a right to set up a semi-permanent camp, like the one established in Cridge Park, is not before the Court.\nRather, the issue is the prohibition on erecting even a temporary shelter taken down each morning in the form of a tent, tarp or cardboard box that is manifested in the current Bylaws and operational policy of the City. In my view, the issue before the Court on this summary trial application is not an assertion by the Defendants of a right to property as contended by the AGBC and the City.\nIn that regard, I agree with the submission of counsel for the Defendants that the AGBC and the City cannot and do not take issue with the proposition that homeless people must sleep, and, given the current situation in Victoria, that some of them must sleep on public property. The use of some public property by the homeless is unavoidable. Whether or not they are allowed to keep themselves dry with a simple tent or a cardboard box, as opposed to lying with a tarp on top of their faces, does not change the nature of that utilization of public space.\nRelated to this is the nature of the use of the property at issue. Unlike the distribution of public funds, the use of park space by an individual does not necessarily involve a deprivation of another person’s ability to utilize the same “resource”. If monies are spent to provide social assistance or the funding of a specific drug, they cannot be used elsewhere. If, on the other hand, a piece of park property is used for someone to sleep at night with shelter, this does not mean that it cannot be used by others for other recreational uses during the day. There is simply no evidence that there is any competition for the public “resource” which the homeless seek to utilize, or that the resource will not remain available to others if the homeless can utilize it.\nThe nature of the government interest in public property has most often been discussed in the context of freedom of expression. In that context, the Supreme Court of Canada has definitively rejected the idea that the government can determine the use of its property in the same manner as a private owner. Public properties are held for the benefit of the public, which includes the homeless. The government cannot prohibit certain activities on public property based on its ownership of that property if doing so involves a deprivation of the fundamental human right not to be deprived of the ability to protect one’s own bodily integrity: see Comité pour la République du Canada - Committee for the Commonwealth of Canada v. Canada, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 139 (S.C.C.); Jeremy Waldron, ”Homelessness and Community” (2000) 50 U.T.L.J. 371.\nI conclude that the Defendants are not asserting a property right. They do not claim that the homeless can exclude anyone from any City property, or determine the use of any City property. They do not seek to have public property allocated to their exclusive use. What they are seeking does not amount to an appropriation of public property. They are simply saying that the City cannot manage its own property in a manner that interferes with their ability to keep themselves safe and warm.\n(e) Is there a Risk of Harm?\nThe final submission of the AGBC and the City in relation to their contention that this case does not fall within the scope of s. 7 is that there is no evidence that the prohibition causes harm or the risk of harm.\nThe City submits that the evidence shows that some homeless people may prefer to live in “tent cities” rather than in shelters or rather than actively participating in efforts to find them housing. The City submits that therefore it is not established on the evidence that the City’s Bylaws have an adverse impact on the life, liberty and/or security of a person merely by limiting the nature of the abode that persons may construct in public places. As discussed earlier in these Reasons, it is the case that some of the Defendants deposed that they preferred the Tent City in Cridge Park to accommodation in shelters.\nHowever, the fact remains that there are many more homeless people in Victoria than available shelter. It therefore does not really matter whether some homeless people prefer to sleep in shelters or not — there is not sufficient room for them in the shelters. Moreover, as noted earlier, many of the Defendants deposed that they have been turned away from shelters. This is consistent with the other evidence before the Court. I note further that the Mayor’s Task Force Report submitted into evidence by the City did not conclude that there are sufficient shelter spaces for all who wish to use them.\nIt is correct that it does not follow from the fact that there are insufficient shelter spaces to accommodate the homeless that the Bylaws create an adverse impact. In order to analyse this issue it is necessary to examine the expert evidence and its implications with respect to the limitations on shelter imposed by the Bylaws and the operational policy. With respect to the limitations on shelter, the City submits that the only item excluded from the minimum equipment that in Mr. Hogya’s opinion is required for necessary minimum protection, is string; the implication is that the equipment the City permits is sufficient to protect against the risks associated with exposure to the elements.\nMr. Hogya’s opinion is that in addition to ground insulation, the necessary minimum protection includes overhead protection in the form of either a tent or a bivy sack and tarp that is strung up to erect a tent-like protection. The size of the tarp-like protection necessary depends upon weather conditions, ranging from 2m × 3m in mild weather to 4m × 4m in stormy weather. In addition, Dr. Hwang referred to shelter in the form of a tent, tarpaulin or cardboard box.\nThe point of each alternative is that it is necessary to secure overhead protection. However, the Bylaw and the operational policy prohibit the erection of even temporary overhead protection in the form of tents, tarps strung up or cardboard boxes. I find that the difference between what is prohibited and what is permitted is not string, but overhead protection, and it is in my view clear on the evidence that overhead protection is required to provide protection from the risk of exposure.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nI have found that a significant number of people in the City of Victoria have no choice but to sleep outside in the City’s parks or streets. The City’s Bylaws prohibit those homeless persons from erecting even the most rudimentary form of shelter to protect them from the elements. The prohibition on erecting shelter is in effect at all times, in all public places in the City. I have found further that the effect of the prohibition is to impose upon those homeless persons, who are among the most vulnerable and marginalized of the City’s residents, significant and potentially severe additional health risks. In addition, sleep and shelter are necessary preconditions to any kind of security, liberty or human flourishing. I have concluded that the prohibition on taking a temporary abode contained in the Bylaws and operational policy constitutes an interference with the life, liberty and security of the person of these homeless people. Finally, I have concluded that the prohibition is both arbitrary and overbroad and hence not consistent with the principles of fundamental justice.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nVIII Disposition # Accordingly, this Court declares that:\n(a) Sections 13(1) and (2),14(1) and (2), and 16(1) of the Parks Regulation Bylaw No. 07-059 and ss. 73(1) and 74(1) of the Streets and Traffic Bylaw No. 92-84 violate s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in that they deprive homeless people of life, liberty and security of the person in a manner not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice, and are not saved by s. 1 of the Charter.\n(b) Sections 13(1) and (2),14(1) and (2), and 16(1) of the Parks Regulation Bylaw No. 07-059 and ss. 73(1) and 74(1) of the Streets and Traffic Bylaw No. 92-84 are of no force and effect insofar and only insofar as they apply to prevent homeless people from erecting temporary shelter.\n[\u0026hellip;]\n"},{"id":189,"href":"/casebook/governance/victoriapark/","title":"Victoria Park Racing and Recreational Grounds Co Ltd v Taylor ","section":"Chapter 2","content":" Latham C.J. — # This is an appeal from a judgment for the defendants given by Nicholas J. in an action by the Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co Ltd against Taylor and others.\nThe plaintiff company carries on the business of racing upon a racecourse known as Victoria Park. The defendant Taylor is the owner of land near the racecourse. He has placed an elevated platform on his land from which it is possible to see what takes place on the racecourse and to read the information which appears on notice boards on the course as to the starters, scratchings, etc, and the winners of the races. The defendant Angles stands on the platform and through a telephone comments upon and describes the races in a particularly vivid manner and announces the names of the winning horses. The defendant the Commonwealth Broadcasting Corporation holds a broadcasting licence under the regulations made under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905-1936 and carries on the business of broadcasting from station 2 UW. This station broadcasts the commentaries and descriptions given by Angles. The plaintiff wants to have the broadcasting stopped because it prevents people from going to the races and paying for admission. The evidence shows that some people prefer hearing about the races as seen by Angles to seeing the races for themselves. The plaintiff contends that the damage which it thus suffers gives, in all the circumstances, a cause of action.\nThe plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s case is put as an action upon the case for nuisance affecting the use and enjoyment of the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s land. It is also contended that there is an unnatural user of Taylor\u0026rsquo;s land by Angles to which the Broadcasting Co is a party and of which it takes advantage. The unnatural user is, I understand, alleged to consist in the erection of the wooden structure on Taylor\u0026rsquo;s land, which Angles uses and the use of the land for broadcasting purposes. It is contended that, there being this unnatural user of the land, the defendant is liable for all the damage which may happen to any person, including the plaintiff, as a result of such user.\nThe first contention is that the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s land has been made suitable for a racecourse, that by reason of the action of the defendants it has been deprived of at least some measure of that suitability, and that therefore this is a case of nuisance-an unlawful interference with the use and enjoyment of land. No analogous case has been cited to the court. I agree that the category of nuisance is not closed and that if some new method of interfering with the comfort of persons in the use of land emerges the law may provide a remedy. For example, the increasing use of electricity, with the possibility of the escape of electricity into an adjoining property, has provided a new possible source of interference with the use of land and the law provides a remedy in such a case.\nIn this case, however, in my opinion, the defendants have not interfered in any way with the use and enjoyment of the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s land. The effect of their actions is to make the business carried on by the plaintiff less profitable, and they do so by providing a competitive entertainment. It is unnecessary to cite authorities for the proposition that mere competition (certainly if without any motive of injuring the plaintiff) is not a cause of action. The facts are that the racecourse is as suitable as ever it was for use as a racecourse. What the defendants do does not interfere with the races, nor does it interfere with the comfort or enjoyment of any person who is on the racecourse. The alleged nuisance cannot be detected by any person upon the land as operating or producing any effect upon the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s land. It is consistent with the evidence that none of the persons on that land may, at any given moment, be aware of the fact that a broadcast is being made. The only alleged effect of the broadcast is an effect in relation to people who are not upon the land, that is, the people who listen in or have the opportunity of listening in and who therefore stay away from the land. In my opinion the defendants have not in any way interfered with the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s land or the enjoyment thereof.\nThe plaintiff relied upon the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas [use your property in a way that does not harm others]. The argument founded upon this maxim is met by Bonomi v Backhouse, which is referred to by the learned trial judge. I think it is desirable to reproduce the passage which the learned judge quotes in his judgment: \u0026ldquo;As a general principle, it is difficult to conceive a cause of action from damage when no right has been violated, and no wrong has been done. The maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas is mere verbiage. A party may damage the property of another where the law permits; and he may not where the law prohibits: so that the maxim can never be applied till the law is ascertained; and, when it is, the maxim is superfluous\u0026rdquo;. I am unable to see that any right of the plaintiff has been violated or any wrong done to him. Any person is entitled to look over the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s fences and to see what goes on in the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s land. If the plaintiff desires to prevent this, the plaintiff can erect a higher fence. Further, if the plaintiff desires to prevent its notice boards being seen by people from outside the enclosure, it can place them in such a position that they are not visible to such people. At sports grounds and other places of entertainment it is the lawful, natural and common practice to put up fences and other structures to prevent people who are not prepared to pay for admission from getting the benefit of the entertainment. In my opinion, the law cannot by an injunction in effect erect fences which the plaintiff is not prepared to provide. The defendant does no wrong to the plaintiff by looking at what takes place on the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s land. Further, he does no wrong to the plaintiff by describing to other persons, to as wide an audience as he can obtain, what takes place on the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s ground. The court has not been referred to any principle of law which prevents any man from describing anything which he sees anywhere if he does not make defamatory statements, infringe the law as to offensive language, etc, break a contract, or wrongfully reveal confidential information. The defendants did not infringe the law in any of these respects.\nThe plaintiff further contended that there was an unnatural user of land by the defendant Taylor and that all the defendants were liable for resulting damage to the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s land or to the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s business. In my opinion, this contention cannot be supported. \u0026ldquo;Prima facie, it is lawful to erect what one pleases on one\u0026rsquo;s own land\u0026rdquo; (Rogers v Rajendro Dutt, at p. 89). It is not suggested that Taylor has broken any building regulation. If he had done so the remedy would be found under the relevant building regulations, and not in an action of the present kind. In truth, the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s complaint would be the same in all material particulars if Taylor had a two-storey house from the upper storey of which Angles made his broadcast. In my opinion it would be impossible to contend that there was an unnatural user of the land and because they were used for that purpose. If Taylor complies with any relevant provision under the Federal Post and Telegraph Act or the Wireless Telegraphy Act, he is entitled to have a telephone and to use his premises as an originating point for broadcasting. So also the Commonwealth Broadcasting Co is entitled to broadcast under the licence granted in pursuance of the Federal regulations. I am not prepared to assent to what I regard as the surprising argument that the use of land for broadcasting is an unnatural user of land within the principle of Rylands v Fletcher. Broadcasting of races could doubtless be prevented, either altogether or without the consent of the persons who undertake the trouble and expense of organizing race meetings, by a regulation dealing with the conditions of broadcasting licences; but no such regulation has yet been made.\nIn reality there is no particular connection between the use of the defendant Taylor\u0026rsquo;s land as land and the wrong which the plaintiff alleges that it suffers. The position in all material particulars would be exactly the same if the broadcasting were done from a motor car on a road from which the racecourse could be seen or by a man standing on high land of which he was not the owner or the occupier. Reference to Taylor\u0026rsquo;s land in the argument is introduced only for the purpose of relying upon an alleged unnatural user of that land. As I have already said, in my opinion, there is no such user.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed. Rich J. — # The plaintiff company is the owner and occupier of certain land near Sydney which is laid out and equipped as a racecourse. The locality is eminently suited for such purpose\u0026ndash;there are two or three similar courses in the vicinity\u0026ndash;and the land is being put to its best use and that use is natural and legitimate. The plaintiff company at frequent intervals holds meetings on this course. Its privacy or exclusiveness is guarded by suitable fences and gates. The result is that no one, unless entrance is permitted, can under ordinary conditions view the races or obtain the information, which is only published on the course. That information is shown on boards and semaphores and consists in the scratchings of horses, the position at the barrier of the horses running, the names of the jockeys, the protest flag and the result of the races. The defendants, on the other hand, are using their premises in a non-natural way which curtails or impairs the use and enjoyment of the plaintiff company\u0026rsquo;s land and detracts from its value. The defendant Taylor owns and occupies a cottage and land opposite the racecourse. On the land at the side of this cottage he has erected a tower and platform.\nAn observer standing on the platform is enabled to view the whole of the racing tracks and obtain the collated information to which I have referred.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn these circumstances the learned judge held that the case was one of damnum sine injuria. The question to be solved is, \u0026ldquo;How far can one person restrain another from invading the privacy of land which he occupies, when such invasion does not involve actual entry on the land?\u0026rdquo; (Professor Winfield, Law Quarterly Review, vol. 47, p. 24). The defendants contended that the law provides no remedy as their action did not fall within any classification of torts and that the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s remedy lay either in self-defence, e.g., raising the height of the fences round the course, or in an application to the legislature. It does not follow that because no precedent can be found a principle does not exist to support the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s right. Nuisance covers so wide a field that no general definition of nuisance has been attempted but only a classification of the various kinds of nuisance. Courts have always refrained from fettering themselves by definitions.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThis case presents the peculiar features that by means of broadcasting\u0026ndash;a thing novel both in fact and law\u0026ndash;the knowledge obtained by overlooking the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s racecourse from the defendants\u0026rsquo; tower is turned to account in a manner which impairs the value of the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s occupation of the land and diverts a legitimate source of profit from its business into the pockets of the defendants. It appears to me that the true issue is whether a non-natural use of a neighbour\u0026rsquo;s land made by him for the purpose of obtaining the means of appropriating in this way part of the profitable enjoyment of the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s land to his own commercial ends-a thing made possible only by radio-falls within the reason of the principles which give rise to the action on the case in the nature of nuisance. There is no absolute standard as to what constitutes a nuisance in law. But all the surrounding circumstances must be taken into consideration in each case. As regards neighbouring properties their interdependence is important in arriving at a decision in a given case. An improper or non-natural use or a use in excess of a man\u0026rsquo;s right which curtails or impairs his neighbour\u0026rsquo;s legitimate enjoyment of his property is \u0026ldquo;tortious and hurtful\u0026rdquo; and constitutes a nuisance.\nA man has no absolute right \u0026ldquo;within the ambit of his own land\u0026rdquo; to act as he pleases. His right is qualified and such of his acts as invade his neighbour\u0026rsquo;s property are lawful only in so far as they are reasonable having regard to his own circumstances and those of his neighbour (Law Quarterly Review, vol. 52, p. 460; vol. 53, p. 3). The plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s case must, I am prepared to concede, rest on what is called nuisance. But it must not be overlooked that this means no more than that he must complain of some impairment of the rights flowing from occupation and ownership of land. One of the prime purposes of occupation of land is the pursuit of profitable enterprises for which the exclusion of others is necessary either totally or except upon conditions which may include payment. In the present case in virtue of its occupation and ownership the plaintiff carries on the business of admitting to the land for payment patrons of racing. There it entertains them by a spectacle, by a competition in the comparative merits of racehorses, and it attempts by all reasonable means to give to those whom it admits the exclusive right of witnessing the spectacle, the competition and of using the collated information in betting while that is possible on its various events. This use of its rights as occupier is usual, reasonable and profitable. So much no one can dispute. If it be true that an adjacent owner has an unqualified and absolute right to overlook an occupier whatever may be the enterprise he is carrying on and to make any profitable use to which what he sees can be put, whether in his capacity of adjacent owner or otherwise, then to that extent the right of the occupier carrying on the enterprise must be modified and treated in law as less extensive and ample than perhaps is usually understood. But can the adjacent owner by virtue of his occupation and ownership use his land in such an unusual way as the erection of a platform involves, bring mechanical appliances into connection with that use, i.e., the microphone and land line to the studio, and then by combining regularity of observation with dissemination for gain of the information so obtained give the potential patrons a mental picture of the spectacle, an account of the competition between the horses and of the collated information needed for betting, for all of which they would otherwise have recourse to the racecourse and pay? To admit that the adjacent owner may overlook does not answer this question affirmatively.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nThere can be no right to extend the normal use of his land by the adjoining owner indefinitely. He may within limits make fires, create smoke and use vibratory machinery. He may consume all the water he finds on his land, but he has no absolute right to dirty it. Defendants\u0026rsquo; rights are related to plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s rights and each owner\u0026rsquo;s rights may be limited by the rights of the other. Sic utere tuo is not the premise in a syllogism but does indicate the fact that damnum may spring from injuria even though the defendant can say: \u0026ldquo;I am an owner.\u0026rdquo; All the nuisance cases, including in that category Rylands v Fletcher, are mere illustrations of a very general principle \u0026ldquo;that law grows and\u0026hellip;though the principles of law remain uncharged, yet (and it is one of the advantages of the common law) their application is to be changed with the changing circumstances of the times. Some persons may call this retrogression, I call it progression of human opinion\u0026rdquo; (R. v Ramsay and Foote, at p. 735). I adapt Lord Macmillan\u0026rsquo;s words and say: \u0026ldquo;The categories of \u0026rsquo;nuisance\u0026rsquo; are not closed\u0026rdquo; (Donoghue v Stevenson, at p. 619). Nuisance is not trespass on the case and physical or material interference is not necessary. The \u0026ldquo;vibration\u0026rdquo; cases and the \u0026ldquo;besetting and eavesdropping\u0026rdquo; cases are certainly against such a contention. What appears to me to be the real point in this case is that the right of view or observation from adjacent land has never been held to be an absolute and complete right of property incident to the occupation of that land and exercisable at all hazards notwithstanding its destructive effect upon the enjoyment of the land overlooked. In the absence of any authority to the contrary I hold that there is a limit to this right of overlooking and that the limit must be found in an attempt to reconcile the right of free prospect from one piece of land with the right of profitable enjoyment of another.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nI think that the appeal should be allowed.\nDixon J. — # [\u0026hellip;]\nThe plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s counsel relied in the first instance upon an action on the case in the nature of nuisance. The premises of the plaintiff are occupied by it for the purpose of a racecourse. They have the natural advantage of not being overlooked by any surrounding heights or raised ground. They have been furnished with all the equipment of a racecourse and so enclosed as to prevent any unauthorized ingress or, unless by some such exceptional devices as the defendants have adopted, any unauthorized view of the spectacle. The plaintiff can thus exclude the public who do not pay and can exclude them not only from presence at, but also from knowledge of, the proceedings upon the course. It is upon the ability to do this that the profitable character of the enterprise ultimately depends. The position of and the improvements to the land thus fit it for a racecourse and give its occupation a particular value. The defendants then proceed by an unusual use of their premises to deprive the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s land of this value, to strip it of its exclusiveness. By the tower placed where the race will be fully visible and equipped with microphone and line, they enable Angles to see the spectacle and convey its substance by broadcast. The effect is, the plaintiff says just as if they supplied the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s customers with elevated vantage points round the course from which they could witness all that otherwise would attract them and induce them to pay the price of admission to the course. The feature in which the plaintiff finds the wrong of nuisance is the impairment or deprivation of the advantages possessed by the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s land as a racecourse by means of a non-natural and unusual use of the defendants\u0026rsquo; land.\nThis treatment of the case will not, I think, hold water. It may be conceded that interferences of a physical nature, as by fumes, smell and noise, are not the only means of committing a private nuisance. But the essence of the wrong is the detraction from the occupier\u0026rsquo;s enjoyment of the natural rights belonging to, or in the case of easements, of the acquired rights annexed to, the occupation of land. The law fixes those rights. Diversion of custom from a business carried on upon the land may be brought about by noise, fumes, obstruction of the frontage or any other interference with the enjoyment of recognized rights arising from the occupation of property and, if so, it forms a legitimate head of damage recoverable for the wrong; but it is not the wrong itself. The existence or the use of a microphone upon neighbouring land is, of course, no nuisance. If one, who could not see the spectacle, took upon himself to broadcast a fictitious account of the races he might conceivably render himself liable in a form of action in which his falsehood played a part, but he would commit no nuisance. It is the obtaining a view of the premises which is the foundation of the allegation. But English law is, rightly or wrongly, clear that the natural rights of an occupier do not include freedom from the view and inspection of neighbouring occupiers or of other persons who enable themselves to overlook the premises. An occupier of land is at liberty to exclude his neighbour\u0026rsquo;s view by any physical means he can adopt. But while it is no wrongful act on his part to block the prospect from adjacent land, it is no wrongful act on the part of any person on such land to avail himself of what prospect exists or can be obtained. Not only is it lawful on the part of those occupying premises in the vicinity to overlook the land from any natural vantage point, but artificial erections may be made which destroy the privacy existing under natural conditions.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nSo far as freedom from view or inspection is a natural or acquired physical characteristic of the site, giving it value for the purpose of the business or pursuit which the plaintiff conducts, it is a characteristic which is not a legally protected interest. It is not a natural right for breach of which a legal remedy is given, either by an action in the nature of nuisance or otherwise. The fact is that the substance of the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s complaint goes to interference, not with its enjoyment of the land, but with the profitable conduct of its business. If English law had followed the course of development that has recently taken place in the United States, the \u0026ldquo;broadcasting rights\u0026rdquo; in respect of the races might have been protected as part of the quasi-property created by the enterprise, organization and labour of the plaintiff in establishing and equipping a racecourse and doing all that is necessary to conduct race meetings. But courts of equity have not in British jurisdictions thrown the protection of an injunction around all the intangible elements of value, that is, value in exchange, which may flow from the exercise by an individual of his powers or resources whether in the organization of a business or undertaking or the use of ingenuity, knowledge, skill or labour.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn my opinion, the right to exclude the defendants from broadcasting a description of the occurrences they can see upon the plaintiff\u0026rsquo;s land is not given by law. It is not an interest falling within any category which is protected at law or in equity. I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Rich J., but I am unable to regard the considerations which are there set out as justifying what I consider amounts not simply to a new application of settled principle but to the introduction into the law of new doctrine.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn my opinion the judgment of Nicholas J. is right and the appeal should be dismissed.\n[\u0026hellip;]\nIn separate opinions, Evatt J. concurred with the judgment of Rich J. and McTiernan J. concurred with the judgements of Lathan C.J. and Dixon J.\nAppeal dismissed.\n"},{"id":190,"href":"/casebook/title/land-title-clarification/","title":"Why Land Title Clarification?","section":"Chapter 3","content":"Downey and Beals, above, discuss some of the history behind African Nova Scotian settlement in the province and describe how the LTCA and its predecessor legislation was enacted to transform possessory rights into formal land titles. One prominent idea in these cases is that the lack of clear land title is a central cause of economic underdevelopment in African Nova Scotian communities\u0026ndash;and is one that can be adequately remedied through legal processes designed to recognize and formalize longstanding possessory rights.\nRecent research by Melisa Marsman (currently a Purdy Crawford Fellow at the Schulich School of Law, Dalhousie University) has challenged the idea that we should interpret a lack of clear land title as the predominant cause of racial disparities in wealth in Nova Scotia.1 Her work asks us to think carefully about the LTCA as an adequate response to those disparities and their historical roots.\nIn her study, Marsman points out that both white settlers in Nova Scotia and Black Refugees received \u0026ldquo;tickets of location\u0026rdquo; upon settlement\u0026ndash;that is recognition of their possessory rights short of title. Nevertheless, anti-Black racism was systematically embedded in provincial laws that determined how these possessory rights in land were allocated\u0026ndash;African Nova Scotians were granted rights in smaller plots of more marginal lands that were often unsuitable for agriculture compared to white settlers\u0026ndash;and they continued to exclude Black Refugees from opportunities to build land-based wealth beyond these initial allocations.\nMarsman writes:\nNow over 200 years later, the required action is more than simply attaining perfected title to land. The economic consequences attributed to the racial disparities in colonial land allocations, including land quantity, must also be redressed. To be clear, it is not the intention here to condone colonialism. The unlawful wide-scale colonial land settlement practices in this province violated the terms of the treaties with the Mi’kmaq and must be rectified. However, the colonial land settlement activities also oppressed a significant group of African Nova Scotian ancestors, being the Black Refugees, and contributed to longstanding and inter-generational racial disparities in wealth and poverty that must also be redressed. The obscurity in land titles is merely the tip of the iceberg. A more comprehensive objective is needed, one that is aimed at dismantling the systemic anti-Black racism in the law and redressing the harmful imbalance that the law has caused thus far.\nBoth courts and provincial legislators have emphasized the regularization of possession and the formalization of land titles as a means to redress historical discrimination and ensure economic success in African Nova Scotian communities. Marsman\u0026rsquo;s perspective offers a lens through which to critically analyze this approach and the deeper relationship between possession and title. What kinds of systematic changes within Nova Scotia\u0026rsquo;s legal system do you think would better address Marsman\u0026rsquo;s critique?\nMarsman, Melissa.
